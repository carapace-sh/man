    command: '[AI] The `git mantainer start` command is not a valid Git command. There is no Git subsystem or feature named "maintenance" with a `start` command. If you meant to use other Git commands for maintenance tasks, such as `git prune`, `git gc`, or `git fsck`, please specify the correct command and provide more context if needed.'
    flag:
        scheduler: '[AI] `git maintenance start --scheduler` is a Git command used to manually trigger the git maintenance script with the scheduler option. This script performs various housekeeping tasks such as expiring and pruning unreachable objects in the local repository to keep it optimized and efficient. It''s typically used when you want to perform these tasks explicitly or on a schedule different from Git''s default.'
