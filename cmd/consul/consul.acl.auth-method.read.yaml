    command: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method read` command is used in Hashicorp Consul to retrieve information about authentication methods that are configured for Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Consul. This command does not modify the ACL configuration but only returns the details of the currently defined authentication methods, allowing users to view and understand the security setup for their Consul environment.'
    flag:
        ca-file: |-
            [AI] `consul acl auth-method read --ca-file` is a command used with Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command is specifically related to Consul's Access Control List (ACL) feature.

            The `read` argument specifies that the operation is meant to read ACL data, while `auth-method` indicates that the command pertains to authentication methods. The `--ca-file` option refers to a file containing a list of Certificate Authority (CA) certificates. Consul uses these certificates to authenticate and authorize communication between clients, servers, and other components in a Consul-managed infrastructure.

            In summary, this command is used to read the Consul ACL data with specific authentication methods that are secured by CA certificates found within the provided file.
        ca-path: |-
            [AI] The command `consul acl auth-method read --ca-path` is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command specifically pertains to the Access Control List (ACL) feature of Consul, which manages access control policies for securing resources.

            The `read` flag indicates that this command is intended to retrieve existing ACL policies from Consul's KV store. The `auth-method` argument refers to the authentication method used by the client making the request. This could be a token, certificate, or other recognized authentication mechanism.

            The `--ca-path` flag specifies the location of the Certificate Authority (CA) files on the local machine for authenticating the Consul server's SSL certificates when using TLS certificates for secure communication between clients and the Consul server. These CA files help to ensure that the connection is secure by verifying the identity of the Consul server during the SSL handshake.
        client-cert: '[AI] The `flag "consul acl auth-method read --client-cert"` is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This flag specifies that the Authentication Control List (ACL) rules for reading should be applied using client certificates as the authentication method. With this setting, Consul will only grant access to protected resources based on the presented client certificate''s identity and permissions.'
        client-key: |-
            [AI] The command `consul acl auth-method read --client-key` is used with the Consul Access Control List (ACL) tool to retrieve the authentication details of a specific client key.

            The flags break down as follows:

            1. `acl`: Specifies that the consul command being run is related to ACL functionality.
            2. `auth-method`: Indicates that this command will be used to manage or view authentication methods, specifically for clients.
            3. `read`: Instructs the tool to retrieve information about an existing authentication method or client key, as opposed to creating a new one.
            4. `--client-key`: Specifies that the read operation should be performed on a specific client key. This flag is mandatory when using the `read` flag.
        datacenter: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl auth-method read --datacenter` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This specific command reads the Access Control List (ACL) rules from the Consul datacenter with the specified authentication method.

            The `--auth-method` flag indicates the method used to authenticate and authorize requests to the Consul HTTP API. It can be set to various methods such as token, x509 certificates, or username/password pairs.

            The `--datacenter` flag is used to specify which datacenter to read the ACL rules from in a multi-datacenter setup of Consul. This ensures that the correct access policies are being applied based on the location of the services and clients involved.
        format: |-
            [AI] The command `consul acl auth-method read --format` is used with the Consul Access Control List (ACL) tool to retrieve information about authentication methods configured for reading access in Consul.

            Consul is a service discovery, configuration, and orchestration tool. Its ACL feature allows administrators to define and manage access policies for various resources within the Consul environment. Authentication methods are used to secure these policies, ensuring that only authorized users or services can access the defined resources.

            In this command:

            - `consul` is the command-line interface for interacting with a Consul server.
            - `acl` is the subcommand for managing ACL policies.
            - `auth-method` is a further subcommand used to manage authentication methods, which are configurations that specify how users or services authenticate to Consul.
            - `read` specifies the read access level for the authentication method being queried. This could include reading ACL policies, service information, or other data within the Consul environment.
            - `--format` is an option used to specify the output format of the command. In this case, it's set to plain text (the default format), but other options like JSON or tabular are available depending on your preference.
        http-addr: |-
            [AI] The `flag "consul acl auth-method read --http-addr"` is a command used with the Consul Access Control List (ACL) system. Here's what it does in a nutshell:

            1. `consul`: This refers to the Consul service, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration.
            2. `acl`: The ACL feature allows you to define rules for controlling access to resources in your Consul environment.
            3. `auth-method read`: This flag is used to specify the authentication method that will be used when reading ACL policies. It means that only requests authenticated using this specified method will be allowed to read the policies.
            4. `--http-addr`: This flag sets the Consul HTTP API address where the authentication request will be sent. The value could be an IP address or a domain name followed by the port number (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8500`).

            So, in summary, this command configures the Consul ACL system to use a specific authentication method for reading policies and sets the HTTP API address where the authentication request should be sent.
        meta: |-
            [AI] The command `consul acl auth-method read --meta` is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source multi-purpose solution for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command is specifically related to the Access Control List (ACL) functionality of Consul.

            Here's a breakdown of the parts:

            1. `consul`: This refers to the Consul application itself.
            2. `acl`: Access Control Lists are a feature in Consul that allows you to manage who can access which resources.
            3. `auth-method`: Authentication methods define how Consul identifies and authenticates entities (users or services) within your infrastructure.
            4. `read`: This verb specifies that the command will be used for reading data, i.e., retrieving ACL information from Consul.
            5. `--meta`: The `--meta` flag indicates that you want to retrieve metadata along with the ACL rules when querying for information. Metadata can include things like rule IDs, creation and modification timestamps, etc.
        name: |-
            [AI] The command `consul acl auth-method read --name` is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command is specifically related to Access Control Lists (ACL) in Consul.

            The `read` flag indicates that the operation being performed is to retrieve information about an ACL entry or entries. The `auth-method` flag specifies that the read operation will be performed using a specific authentication method.

            The `--name` flag is used to identify the name of the ACL entry whose information is to be retrieved. In summary, this command is used to retrieve the details of an ACL entry by specifying its name and the authentication method to use for accessing that data.
        namespace: '[AI] The command `consul acl auth-method read --namespace` is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command reads the access control list (ACL) authentication methods configured within a specific namespace in Consul. Authentication methods define how Consul verifies the identity of clients making requests to the Consul API or joining as members in a Consul agent cluster. The output will show details about the currently configured authentication methods and their associated settings, such as name, type (token, certificates, etc.), and any additional configuration options.'
        stale: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl auth-method read --stale` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command reads Access Control Lists (ACLs) using the Token or Client Certificate authentication method with a stale check.

            ACLs define access control rules for securing Consul resources such as keys, values, and services. The `auth-method` specifies how Consul authenticates requests before processing ACL checks. In this case, it uses either a Token or Client Certificate.

            The `--stale` flag enables reading stale (outdated) data from the Consul server. When enabled, Consul does not validate the latest state of the resources and returns the last known good state. This can be useful when dealing with network issues or temporary inconsistencies in the Consul cluster but should be used with caution as it may result in reading outdated or incorrect information.
        tls-server-name: '[AI] The command `consul acl auth-method read --tls-server-name` is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source distributed system for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command reads the authentication methods configured under Access Control List (ACL) in Consul using TLS (Transport Layer Security) with a specified server name. In simpler terms, it retrieves the list of authentication strategies set up for secure access to Consul''s ACL features. The `--tls-server-name` option specifies the name of the TLS-secured Consul server to connect to.'
        token: |-
            [AI] The command `consul acl auth-method read --token` is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command reads the Access Control List (ACL) rules associated with the specified authentication method using a token for authorization.

            The `auth-method` argument identifies the type of authentication method whose ACL rules need to be retrieved. The `read` subcommand requests that the current ACL rules be displayed. Finally, the `--token` argument provides the token required for authentication when interacting with Consul's ACL API.
        token-file: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method read --token-file` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration management, and orchestration. It reads Access Control List (ACL) rules with the "read" permission using a token file instead of specifying the token directly on the command line. This ensures that sensitive tokens are not exposed in the command history or in log files. The token-file is expected to contain a valid Consul token which is required for ACL operations.'
