documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl list-unit-files` is a Linux command used with systemd init systems to display the available unit files and their current state. It lists each unit file in one of three states: enabled (enabled by default or manually), disabled (not running but can be started), or static (neither configurable nor intended to be run). The output also shows if a file is masked or not, meaning if it has been read-only marked to prevent enabling or disabling.'
