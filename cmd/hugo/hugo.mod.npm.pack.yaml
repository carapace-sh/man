        [AI] `hugo mod npm pack` is a command used in Hugo, a popular static site generator for building websites and applications. This command interacts with Hugo's built-in module system called "Hugo Mod."

        When you use `hugo mod npm pack`, it performs the following tasks:

        1. Builds your Hugo project as usual (if not already built) by running `hugo`.
        2. Packages your project's dependencies, including NPM packages, into a single `.tar.gz` archive or `.zip` file.
        3. Creates an `output/pack` directory containing the packaged archive(s).

        This command is particularly useful for sharing or publishing your project as a standalone package, which can be easily downloaded and installed by others using their preferred package manager like npm.
