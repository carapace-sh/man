    command: '[AI] The command "vhs manual" does not exist as it is not a valid command for any known system or software. VHS refers to Video Home System, an older analog video recording format using magnetic tapes. A manual for VHS typically means a user guide or instruction booklet that comes with a VHS player or recorder to help users understand how to operate the device and use its features effectively.'
