    command: '[AI] The `jj status` command is used in the JetBrains IntelliJ IDEs, such as IntelliJ IDEA or PyCharm.

            [AI] `jj` is a popular Git flow management tool, and `status --help` is one of its commands used to display available options for the status command. Here's a brief explanation:

            This command shows you the current branch, any uncommitted changes in your working directory or the staging area, and any local or remote branches that are ahead or behind your current branch. The output includes information on files with modifications (M), additions (A), deletions (D), and new files (?).

            The `--help` option is appended to provide more detailed information about the command's usage, such as available options for filtering by specific file types or showing only untracked files. It also shows any other related subcommands, like `jj status <commit>`, which can display the status of a particular commit.
