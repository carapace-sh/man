documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pulumi state rename` is a command in Pulumi, an infrastructure as code (IaC) platform, used to rename resources or their properties in the local state file without changing the underlying infrastructure. This can be helpful when refactoring code or making naming conventions consistent. The syntax is `pulumi state rename <resourceName> [<newName>]`, where `<resourceName>` is the name of the resource to be renamed, and `[<newName>]` is the desired new name (optional if renaming within the same stack).'
    flag:
        "yes": '[AI] `pulumi state rename` is a command provided by Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform, to rename resources in the current state file. The `--yes` or `-y` flag is used with this command for confirming the action without any further prompts. When you execute `pulumi state rename <old_name> <new_name> --yes`, it renames all occurrences of `<old_name>` in the current state file to `<new_name>` and updates the configuration accordingly. This command is useful when you are refactoring your infrastructure code, and you want to update the corresponding states without interruption.'
