        [AI] "go-tool-pack" is not a standard command or tool in Go programming language. It seems to be a misnomer, as "Go Toolchain" or simply "Go Tools" would be more accurate terms.

        Go Tools refer to a collection of utility programs that are included with the Go distribution. They help developers build, test, and maintain Go projects. Some popular tools include go build (for compiling Go source code), go get (for downloading and installing dependencies), go test (for running tests), and go doc (for generating documentation). These tools can be invoked from the command line with the prefix "go".
