        [AI] `dlv` is a debugger for Delve, which is a popular source-level debugger for Go programs. The command `dlv completion powershell` is used to request autocompletion suggestions for PowerShell commands or expressions in the Delve debugger's REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) environment.

        When you type this command in the debugger, it will provide you with a list of possible completions based on the context, such as the current variables, functions, or keywords available in your PowerShell script or session. This feature helps improve productivity by reducing typing errors and saving time while working in the debugger.
    flag:
        no-descriptions: '[AI] The command `dlv completion powershell --no-descriptions` is used with the Delve debugger for PowerShell. It requests for automatic completion suggestions while typing commands in the PowerShell console, but without displaying descriptions or tooltips for each suggestion. This can lead to a more streamlined and faster experience for experienced users who are already familiar with the available commands.'
