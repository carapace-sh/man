documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh variable` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to manage and view values of GitHub Actions secrets or personal access tokens stored in your GitHub account. It allows you to create, update, delete, and list these variables. The command interacts with the `github.com/actions/secure-fields` repository where the encrypted versions of these variables are stored. For instance, `gh variable set NAME VALUE` sets a new variable or updates an existing one, while `gh variable list` displays all the current variables and their respective encrypted IDs.'
