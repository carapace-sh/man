documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "tea logins" is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It seems to be specific to TEA (Tiny Evil Agent), a lightweight, cross-platform, and persistent remote access tool that can establish encrypted reverse or forward connections with an attacker-controlled C&C server. The "tea logins" command is likely used to manage or list active logins or sessions established using TEA. Without more context or information about the environment in which this command is being used, it''s impossible to provide a definitive explanation.'
