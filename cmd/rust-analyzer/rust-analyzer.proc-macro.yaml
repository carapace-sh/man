        [AI] Rust `proc-macro` is a type of macro in the Rust programming language, which is used to generate code at compile time instead of runtime. The term "Rust-analyzer proc-macro" specifically refers to using the Rust analyzer tool to check or analyze procedural macros.

        The Rust-analyzer is a compiler frontend and linter that provides rich type checking, code navigational assistance, autocompletion, and more, in real time as you write your Rust code. When working with proc-macros, the Rust-analyzer is able to understand their input and output by integrating with the proc-macro expansions of the compiler itself. This means that the Rust-analyzer can provide useful feedback and suggestions when writing or using procedural macros in your Rust projects.
