        [AI] The `newrelic workload duplicate` command is not a standard New Relic or any other commonly used command. It seems to be specific to a New Relic feature or toolset that I'm not aware of.

        To provide an accurate explanation, more context about the New Relic product, API, or CLI (Command-Line Interface) this command is related to is required.

        For now, I would recommend checking the New Relic documentation or contacting their support team for clarification on the `newrelic workload duplicate` command.
    flag:
        guid: |-
            [AI] The `newrelic workload duplicate --guid` command is a part of New Relic's Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, which allows users to manage and interact with their New Relic applications programmatically.

            This specific command duplicates an existing workload (a collection of application performance data points) using the provided guid (globally unique identifier). The result will be a new workload with identical characteristics as the original one.
        name: '[AI] The `newrelic workload duplicate` command with the `--name` option is used in New Relic to create a duplicate workload profile with the same configuration but a different name. This can be helpful when you want to keep track of similar workloads with distinct names for better organization and identification. It does not affect the performance or behavior of the original workload.'
