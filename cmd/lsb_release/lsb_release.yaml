documentation:
    command: '[AI] `lsb-release` is a command-line utility in Linux systems that retrieves and displays information about the installed Linux distribution, its codename or release name, version number, and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). It reads and interprets the contents of the LSB (Linux Standard Base) files located in `/etc/lsb-release` file. This command is useful for system administration tasks that require determining the Linux distribution and its specific release details.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `lsb_release --all` is a command used in Linux systems to display detailed information about the installed Linux distribution, its codename, version, and release date. It shows multiple lines of output with the name, code name, architecture, ID, and description of the operating system. This command helps in identifying the specific distribution and its details.'
        codename: '[AI] `lsb_release --codename` is a command used in Linux and Unbuntu-based systems to retrieve the name of the current release or codename of the Linux distribution. The output will be in the format "codename-version" (e.g., "jammy-27.3"). This information can be useful for determining the specific version of a distribution and ensuring compatibility with software packages.'
        description: '[AI] `lsb_release --description` is a command used in Linux systems to retrieve the description of the current Linux distribution and its codename or release name. The output typically includes the name, version, and codename or release tag of the distribution. This information can be helpful for identifying the specific distribution and version being used for various system administration tasks or scripting purposes.'
        help: '[AI] `lsb_release` is a command-line utility in Linux distributions that displays the details of the installed system''s Linux Distribution, release name and codename, and other related information. The `--help` option is used to display a brief help message about how to use the `lsb_release` command. It provides information on the available options, their meanings, and usage examples. This option assists users in understanding the command''s functionalities and how to effectively apply it within their Linux environment for system identification purposes.'
        id: '[AI] `lsb_release --id` is a command used in Linux systems to identify and display the codename or short name of the current Linux distribution and its release version. The output consists of two parts: the first part is the codename (e.g., "bionic" for Ubuntu 18.04), and the second part is the release version number (e.g., "18.04"). This command is often used to obtain the distribution information programmatically in scripts or automation tasks.'
        release: '[AI] The `lsb-release` command is a utility in Linux distributions that retrieves and displays information about the installed Linux distribution and its release information, such as the codename, version number, and architecture. The specific command `lsb_release --release` returns only the name and codename of the current Linux distribution''s release. For example, if the output is "Ubuntu 20.04", it indicates that the system is running Ubuntu version 20.04 (Focal Fossa).'
        short: '[AI] `lsb_release --short` is a command used in Linux systems to display the short name and codename of the current Linux distribution and its release version. It''s part of the `lsbieasier-base-utils` package and retrieves the information from the system''s metadata files located in `/etc/os-release`. The output is a string that includes the distribution name, like "Ubuntu" or "Debian", followed by its release version, such as "18.04" or "9.5". This command is useful for quickly identifying the Linux distribution and its version in a script or during system administration tasks.'
        version: '[AI] `lsb_release --version` is a command used in Linux and Unix-based systems to display the version number of the LSB (Linux Standard Base) data that is installed on your system. The LSB is a set of common interfaces and conventions for software packages, making it easier for applications to be portable across different distributions. This command helps you determine which version of the LSB data is being used by your system.'
