    command: '[AI] The term `vhs completion Powershell` likely refers to a PowerShell module named "VHS Completion" which enhances PowerShell tab completion functionality, providing better suggestions based on context and history. It''s an extension for PowerShell similar to what `tab-completion` is for Bash or `Intellisense` for IDEs. For installation and usage details, you can search for it in the PowerShell Gallery using `Install-Module VHSCompleition`.'

            [AI] The command `vhs completion powershell --no-descriptions` is used with the PowerShell extension for Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to configure its IntelliSense feature.

            The option `--no-descriptions` disables the display of descriptions or tooltips for completions suggestions in the PowerShell integrated terminal or script editors within VSCode. This might be useful for users who prefer a more minimal interface and quicker response times, as showing descriptions can add some delay to the completion process.

            For instance, when typing a PowerShell command or variable name, VSCode would typically show suggested completions with their descriptions, allowing you to easily identify which one is intended. With `--no-descriptions` enabled, only the suggestions' names are shown without any additional context information.
