documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "tofu metadata" command is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It appears to be specific to certain data processing tools, particularly those related to data serialization formats like Tape Oriented File (TOFU). TOFU metadata refers to the descriptive information about the data stored in a TOFU file. This can include things like file format version, data type, compression method, and other relevant details. Tools that work with TOFU files may provide commands or functions for examining or modifying this metadata to help users understand and manage their data.'
