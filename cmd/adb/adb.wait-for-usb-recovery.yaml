        [AI] The `adb wait-for-usb-recovery` command is a part of Android Debug Bridge (ADB), which is a versatile tool for communicating with an Android device. This specific command is used to wait for the device to enter USB recovery mode before executing other ADB commands.

        When you run `adb wait-for-usb-recovery`, ADB will check if the device is already in USB recovery mode, and if not, it will repeatedly attempt to put the device into that state by triggering a series of device-specific key combinations via USB. Once the device enters recovery mode, ADB will return control to the user, indicating that the device is ready for further commands related to customizing or troubleshooting the Android system.
