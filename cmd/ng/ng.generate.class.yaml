        project: '[AI] `ng generate class` is a command used in Angular CLI (Angular Command Line Interface) for generating a new TypeScript class file within an existing Angular project. The `--project` option specifies the name or path of the Angular project in which to create the new class. This command sets up the initial files and configurations, saving developers time and effort on setting up the structure manually.'
        skip-tests: '[AI] `ng generate class --skip-tests` is a command used in Angular to create a new TypeScript class file without generating test files (spec.ts and related). This option, `--skip-tests`, skips the automated test setup and configuration process during generation, saving time for developers who prefer managing their tests manually or not writing tests for certain components/classes.'
        type: '[AI] `ng generate class --type` is a command used in Angular to create a new TypeScript class file using the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface). The `--type` option specifies the type of the class, such as component, service, or other built-in types Angular supports. For example, `ng generate class myComponentName --type=component` creates a new component with the given name.'
