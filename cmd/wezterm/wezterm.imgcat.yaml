        [AI] `imgcat` is not a Wezterm (terminal emulator) command in and of itself. However, Wezterm does support displaying images using various methods, such as the `data:image/png;base64,<image_data>` format or using external image viewers like `imagemagick`. If you're referring to using `imgcat` with Wezterm, it likely means using an external tool like ImageMagick's `imgcat` command to read image data and pipe it into Wezterm for display. For example:

        ```bash
        imgcat path/to/image.png | wezterm --data '{"background": "data:image/png;base64,<image_data>"}'
        ```

        Replace `path/to/image.png` with the actual image file path and `<image_data>` with the base64-encoded image data output by `imgcat`. This command pipes the image data from `imgcat` to Wezterm, which then sets it as the terminal background.
    flag:
        height: '[AI] `wezterm imgcat --height` is a command used in the WezTerm terminal emulator for fetching the data of an image file, specifically its height dimension. The `imgcat` subcommand retrieves the binary image data from a URL or file path, while `--height` requests and returns only the height information as an integer value.'

            [AI] `wezterm imgcat` is a command-line tool that comes with WezTerm, a cross-platform terminal emulator. The `--help` option is used to display detailed information about how to use the `imgcat` sub-command. Here's what you'd expect to learn from running `wezterm imgcat --help`:

            1. Brief description: A short explanation of what `imgcat` does - it reads image data from standard input and writes it to standard output.
            2. Usage: The basic syntax of using the command, along with any required arguments or options. For example, it might be as simple as `wezterm imgcat < input.png > output.png`, where `<input.png>` is read from a file and `>output.png` is written to a file.
            3. Options: Any available command-line flags that can modify the behavior of `imgcat`. These might include things like specifying the image format (e.g., PNG, JPG), adjusting the compression level, or setting various quality parameters.
            4. Examples: Simple examples to help illustrate usage and demonstrate best practices for different scenarios.
            5. Exit codes: Information about what exit codes mean when using `imgcat` (for example, 0 for success, 1 for error).

            This command is useful for manipulating images inside WezTerm terminal sessions, for instance, converting image formats on-the-fly or piping images to other commands.
        no-preserve-aspect-ratio: '[AI] `wezterm imgcat` is a command used in the WezTerm terminal emulator to load an image file as a background or tab bar indicator. The `--no-preserve-aspect-ratio` option tells WezTerm not to maintain the original aspect ratio of the image when resizing it to fit within the terminal window, allowing the image to be stretched or squished proportionally. This can be useful for creating custom layouts with overlapping or tiled images.'
        width: '[AI] The command `wezterm imgcat --width` is not a flag but rather a part of a WezTerm (a terminal emulator) command. `imgcat` is an image cat command provided by WezTerm, and `--width` is an option passed to it. This option sets the width of the image that will be displayed in the terminal.'
