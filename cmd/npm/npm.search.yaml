documentation:
    command: '[AI] `npm search` is a command used in Node.js package management system, npm. It allows users to search for packages in the npm registry based on keywords or names. The output includes important details such as the package name, description, version, and number of downloads. Users can refine their search by adding filters such as keywords, authors, and licenses.'
    flag:
        color: '[AI] `npm search` is a command-line utility provided by npm (Node Package Manager) to search for packages in the npm registry. The `--color` option is an argument that enables colored output in the terminal or console. It makes the search results easier to read, as package names and version numbers are displayed in different colors.'
        json: '[AI] `npm search --json` is a command used in Node.js package management system, npm. This command sends an HTTP request to the npm registry with search parameters and returns the results in JSON format. It can be used to programmatically search for packages by keyword, name, or author, among other options. The output includes essential information about each package, such as its name, version, description, and dependencies.'
        long: '[AI] `npm search --long` is a command used in Node.js package management system, npm. This command is used to perform a detailed search of packages available in the npm registry. The `--long` flag increases the output''s verbosity by providing more information per package such as the full description, maintained tags, and authors. It returns a list of packages that match the given search query along with their details.'
        no-description: '[AI] The `npm search` command with the flag `--no-description` instructs npm (Node Package Manager) to return search results excluding packages that have a description in their `package.json` file. This can be useful if you want to narrow down your search results to only see packages based on other metadata like name, author, or version without taking descriptions into account.'
        offline: '[AI] `npm search --offline` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). This command searches for packages locally without connecting to the internet or the npm registry. It looks up packages in the currently installed local npm cache and returns matching results. This can be useful when working offline, or when access to the internet is restricted or slow.'
        parseable: '[AI] `npm search` is a command used in Node.js package manager (npm) to search for packages. The `--parseable` option is an argument that modifies the output format of the search result. Instead of displaying the results in the default JSON or tabular format, it returns the data in a machine-readable format, which is easier to parse and process programmatically.'
        prefer-offline: '[AI] `npm search --prefer-offline` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). This command is used to search for packages in the local registry, giving priority to offline packages that are already installed or available from the local npm cache, instead of downloading them again from the internet. It''s useful for improving installation speed and reducing network usage when working in environments with limited connectivity or large teams with shared caches.'
        prefer-online: '[AI] `npm search --prefer-online` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). This command is used to search for packages in the online registry by default, instead of searching in the local npm cache or other registries. By using the `--prefer-online` flag, npm will prioritize searching and installing packages from the internet, ensuring that you have access to the latest versions and dependencies.'
        searchexclude: '[AI] `npm search` is a command used in Node.js package management system, npm, to search for packages. The option `--searchexclude` allows excluding specific packages or names from the search results. For instance, `npm search --keywords="react" --searchexclude="react-router"` would return all packages containing the keyword "react", except those having "react-router" in their names.'
        searchopts: '[AI] `npm search` is a command provided by npm (Node Package Manager) to search for packages in the npm registry. The `--searchopts` option allows you to modify the behavior of this command with search filters, such as `keywords`, `author`, `maintainer`, `version`, `description`, etc. These options help refine your search results to find more specific or accurate packages for your project needs. For example, `npm search --searchopts keywords=react` would return a list of packages with the keyword "react" in their metadata.'
