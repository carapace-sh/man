        [AI] The `gh label create` command is used to create a new label in GitHub Issues or Pull Requests using the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool called "gh." To use this command, you need to have GitHub CLI installed and authenticated. The basic syntax is as follows:

        ```bash
        gh label create [LABEL_NAME] [ISSUE_NUMBER]
        ```

        Replace `[LABEL_NAME]` with the desired name for your new label, and `[ISSUE_NUMBER]` with the number of the issue or pull request you want to apply the label to. For example:

        ```bash
        gh label create bug 123
        ```

        This command creates a new label named "bug" for issue #123.

            [AI] The `gh label create` command in GitHub's `gh` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to create a new label for an issue or pull request. The `--color` option, if provided, specifies that the label should have a color associated with it when displayed in GitHub interface. The color can be specified using a valid CSS3 color string. For example:

            ```bash
            gh label create my-label --color #FFA500
            ```

            This command creates a new label named "my-label" and sets its color to Orange (#FFA500).
        description: |-
            [AI] The `gh label create` command in GitHub's `gh` CLI creates a new label for an issue or pull request. The `--description` option sets the description for the label. This means that when creating a new label using this command, you can specify a brief explanation of what the label represents in the `--description` argument. For example:

            ```bash
            gh label create my-label --description "Bug: description of the issue"
            ```

            This command creates a new label named 'my-label' with the description "Bug: description of the issue". This makes it easier for team members to understand the nature of issues or PRs just by looking at their labels.
        force: '[AI] The `gh` (GitHub CLI) command `label create --force` creates a new GitHub label with the specified name, and if a label with that name already exists, it forces an update to that label''s metadata without prompting for confirmation. This can be useful when you need to make changes to an existing label without being asked to confirm each time.'
