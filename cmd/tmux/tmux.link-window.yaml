        [AI] The `tmux link-window` command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, is used to bind a window with another window or pane within the same session. When you run this command, you'll need to specify the source and destination windows using their window IDs (you can find the ID by running `tmux list-windows`). The basic syntax for the command is:

        ```sh
        tmux link-window -t <source_window_id> <destination_window_id>
        ```

        This command creates a link between the two windows, making them behave as if they were part of the same pane. This can be helpful in managing multiple related tasks within the same terminal session. For instance, you might use this command to split your main TMUX window into multiple panes and link certain panes together for better organization and easier navigation between tasks.
    flag:
        a: '[AI] The `tmux` command `link-window -a` is used to link two or more windows in the same pane of a `tmux` session horizontally or vertically. The `-a` flag stands for "adjacent," meaning that only adjacent windows can be linked with this option. When you run this command, tmux will link the windows based on their position, creating a contiguous view across multiple windows. This is useful when working on related projects side by side or when managing multiple terminal sessions in a single pane.'
        b: '[AI] The `tmux link-window` command with the `-b` flag is used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to bind two windows together. With this binding, when you resize one window, the linked window automatically adjusts its size accordingly to maintain the same relationship between them. This feature helps keep related panes or applications synchronised and organised within Tmux sessions.'
        d: '[AI] `tmux link-window` is a Tmux command used to link or detach windows based on their panes. The `-d` flag stands for "detach" mode, which means that the linked window will be detached from its session after the linking operation is completed. When using `link-window -d`, you are usually linking a local pane to a remote one (across different Tmux sessions), creating a new window with the linked pair and then detaching it, allowing you to work on that window separately without affecting the original session.'
        k: '[AI] The `tmux` command `link-window -k` is used to link two windows in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. When you run this command, it links the current window with the previous or next window based on the given key (specified by ''-k'' option). For instance, `link-window -k up` will link the current window with the one above it, while `link-window -k down` will link it with the one below. Linked windows share the same pane layout and can be moved as a single entity using the terminal keys `alt+{left,right}`. This is useful for managing multiple related tasks in separate panes or windows within a single Tmux session.'
        s: '[AI] The `tmux link-window` command is used in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, to link two or more windows together. The `-s` option specifies the name or index of the source window. When you run this command with the source window''s session and window identifiers, all the panes in the linked source window will be displayed in the same arrangement in the target window. This helps to maintain consistency between sessions.'
        t: |-
            [AI] `tmux link-window` is a TMUX command used to link or detach windows with the same pane layout, session, or parent window together. The `-t` option specifies the target window title or window ID to link with.

            For instance, `tmux link-window -t main_editor` links the current window with a window having the title "main\_editor". If no windows match this title, an error occurs.

            When used without any arguments, `link-window` assumes the focus is on the window to be linked, so no need to include it in the command. For example:

            ```bash
            $ tmux link-window
            ```

            Links the currently selected window with another window having a matching title or ID specified earlier (using `link-window -t`) within the same Tmux session.
