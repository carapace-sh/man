documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker volume create` is a Docker command used to create a new, empty named volume. Named volumes are a way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. When you run this command with a specified name and an optional driver or other flags, Docker creates a new volume with that name in the default driver (if not specified otherwise) and makes it available for use by Docker containers. The created volume can be used to store data that needs to be kept between container restarts or shares data among multiple containers.'
    flag:
        availability: |-
            [AI] The `docker volume create --availability` command is used to create a new Docker volume with a specified availability option. The availability options for Docker volumes are `replicated` and `local`.

            * `--availability=replicated`: creates a replicated volume, which is automatically replicated across multiple nodes in a swarm mode cluster. Replicated volumes provide high availability and data persistence.
            * `--availability=local`: creates a local volume, which exists only on the host system where it was created. Local volumes are not replicated or backed up, and their data is lost if the host system is destroyed.

            By specifying the availability option when creating a volume, you can choose whether to prioritize data availability and redundancy or keep the volume lightweight and local.
        driver: '[AI] The `docker volume create` command is used to create a new Docker volume. The `--driver` option specifies the storage driver to use for managing the volume. Docker supports several storage drivers, including local, network, and external. For example, `docker volume create --driver=local myvolumename` creates a new local volume named "myvolumename". The choice of driver depends on your specific use case and infrastructure requirements.'
        group: '[AI] The `docker volume create --group` command creates a named Docker volume with an associated Docker network group. This means that all volumes in the same group share the same logical driver and can be managed as a group. When creating the volume, you specify the group name using the `--group` flag. This feature is useful for managing volumes that are related to each other and need to be accessed by multiple Docker containers within the same network.'
        label: '[AI] `docker volume create` is a command used to create a new Docker volume. The `--label` option allows you to add metadata key-value pairs as labels to the volume. This can be useful for providing additional information or identifying the volume in various contexts. For example, you could use labels to indicate the purpose of the volume, its owner, or other relevant details.'
        limit-bytes: '[AI] The `docker volume create` command is used to create a new Docker volume. The `--limit-bytes` option sets a hard limit on the total size of the volume in bytes. This means that once the volume reaches this size, Docker will no longer write data to it unless space is first freed up by deleting or compressing existing data. This can be useful for managing the storage usage of containers and ensuring that volumes don''t grow unchecked.'
        name: '[AI] The `docker volume create` command is used to create a new Docker volume with the specified name. A Docker volume is a data container that can be used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. This command creates a new, empty volume that can be mounted as a data source for containers. The `--name` flag specifies the desired name for the volume.'
        opt: |-
            [AI] The `docker volume create` command in Docker is used to create a new data volume that can be used by Docker containers for storing and sharing data. The `--opt` option is an experimental feature introduced in Docker 18.09 that allows passing custom options to the volume driver when creating a volume.

            When using `--opt`, you specify a key-value pair that will be passed to the driver. For example, `--opt type=local --opt o=source=/host/path` would create a local volume with the source set to the specified host path. The specific options and their effects depend on the chosen volume driver.

            Using this option can provide additional functionality or configuration flexibility when working with Docker volumes. However, it's essential to be aware that experimental features might change in future releases and could have compatibility issues.
        required-bytes: '[AI] The `docker volume create` command is used to create a new Docker volume. The `--required-bytes` option sets a minimum size for the volume. When creating the volume, Docker will ensure that it has at least the specified amount of unallocated space. This option can be useful when managing volumes with specific size requirements.'
        scope: |-
            [AI] The `docker volume create` command in Docker is used to create a new named volume. The `--scope` option specifies the scope of the volume:

            * **Local**: Creates a volume on the host machine where Docker is running. This is the default scope.
            * **Global**: Creates a volume that can be accessed by any Docker daemon registered to the same Docker Swarm or Docker Tunnel endpoint.

            Therefore, `docker volume create --scope global` creates a global volume, while `docker volume create` without any scope option sets it as local.
        secret: '[AI] `docker volume create --secret` is a command used to create a Docker volume with the special type `docker-secret`. This type of volume is not meant to store conventional data but instead securely stores sensitive data, such as passwords or API keys, using the Docker Secret storage driver. When you create a secret volume, Docker will automatically encrypt and decrypt the data for you, ensuring that the data remains secure both at rest and in transit within the Docker environment.'
        sharing: '[AI] `docker volume create --sharing` is a command used to create a new Docker volume with sharing enabled. This means that multiple containers can access and modify the same data. When you create a shared volume, Docker assigns it a named label, which can be referenced by different containers. The shared volume persists even if the containers that use it are removed or restarted, ensuring data consistency across applications.'
        topology-preferred: '[AI] `docker volume create --topology-preferred` is a command used in Docker to create a new named volume with a specific storage driver topology. The `--topology-preferred` option allows specifying which plugin or driver to use for creating the volume, if multiple plugins support the same backend. By default, Docker chooses the plugin based on availability and compatibility. This option can be useful in environments where you want more control over the storage driver used by a volume.'
        topology-required: '[AI] The `docker volume create --topology-required` command creates a Docker volume with the topology mode set to "required." This means that the volume must be deployed on the same node where the container requiring the volume is running, for data persistence and accessibility. If the container is moved to another node in the cluster, an error will occur as the volume will not be available. It''s recommended when data needs to stay local to a specific host or node for security or compliance reasons.'
        type: |-
            [AI] `docker volume create` is a command used to create a new Docker volume. The `--type` option allows you to specify the type of the volume. Docker supports several types of volumes, including:

            1. `local`: stored on the host filesystem.
            2. `anonymous`: also stored on the host filesystem, but without a named driver.
            3. Custom drivers like `aws`, `glusterfs`, or `nfs`.

            Creating a volume with a specific type allows you to choose the storage backend that best fits your use case in terms of data persistence, scalability, and availability.
