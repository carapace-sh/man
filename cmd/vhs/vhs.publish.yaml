documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vhs publish` command is not a standard command in any widely-used programming language or software development tool. It appears to be specific to Video Hosting Services (VHS) platforms, possibly referring to the process of making a video publicly available for viewing by an audience after it has been uploaded and prepared for publishing. This command may involve setting access permissions, adding metadata, and indexing the content for searchability. The exact meaning and implementation depend on the VHS platform''s specific features and APIs.'
