documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `melt completion fish` command is used with the `fish` shell to configure and install tab completions for the R package `melt`. This command generates a file containing the tab completion definitions for `melt`, which can then be loaded into your `fish` configuration. This allows you to use tab completion when writing R code in the `fish` shell.'
    flag:
        no-descriptions: |-
            [AI] The command `melt completion fish --no-descriptions` is related to the `melt` library in Python, which is used for data manipulation and transformation from various sources like CSV, Excel, SQL, etc. The `completion` part suggests this command is related to autocompletion features, probably for a terminal or IDE.

            The `fish` argument indicates that the Fish Shell is being configured for autocomplete suggestions. `--no-descriptions` flag instructs melt not to provide any descriptions or tooltips along with the completions. This can lead to a simpler and faster user experience, as the terminal will only display completion options without additional text.
