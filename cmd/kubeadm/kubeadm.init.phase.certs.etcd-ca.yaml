name: etcd-ca
description: Generate the self-signed CA to provision identities for etcd
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save and store the certificates.
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubernetes-version=: Choose a specific Kubernetes version for the control plane.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm init` command with the `phase certs etcd-ca` argument is used to generate and configure the SSL certificates for the Etcd server in a Kubernetes cluster during initialization. This is an essential step to ensure secure communication between the Etcd server and other components of the Kubernetes control plane. The generated certificates are saved to the specified certificate directory, which by default is `/etc/kubernetes/pki`.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool for initializing Kubernetes clusters. The option `phase certs etcd-ca --cert-dir` specifies that this command should generate and output the certificates and keys needed for the Etcd certificate authority (CA). These certificates are saved in the specified directory (--cert-dir), which can then be used to sign certificates for other components in the Kubernetes cluster. This is an essential step during the initial setup of a Kubernetes cluster to ensure secure communication between various components, such as etcd and the Kubernetes control plane.'
        config: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The option `phase certs etcd-ca --config` specifies that this command should generate and output the Certificate Authority (CA) certificates for the Etcd server in the Kubernetes cluster. These CA certificates are essential components of the secure communication between various components in the cluster, such as Etcd and Kapi-proxy or other members of the control plane. The `--config` flag indicates that the configuration file to use is specified in the given path or as a standard input.'
        kubernetes-version: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line utility used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The specific command `kubeadm init phase certs etcd-ca --kubernetes-version` is responsible for generating the necessary SSL certificates for securing the Etcd server, which is an essential component in the Kubernetes cluster storing the distributed configuration data and metadata. The `--kubernetes-version` flag indicates that this command should be executed using the specified version of Kubernetes.'
