documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `jj` command is not a standard command in Unix or Linux operating systems. It seems to be specific to the Vim text editor''s keyboard shortcuts, where it is used for jumping backward one half page length. In normal mode, pressing ''j'' moves the cursor down one line, but with two ''j'' keys pressed together (jj), Vim moves the cursor upwards by half a page length.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] The `--help` option when used with the `jj` command in a Unix-like environment displays detailed information about available sub-commands, their usage, and optional arguments. It is often used to quickly understand how to use a given command or to remember the correct syntax. In this context, running `jj --help` will print out a comprehensive help message explaining what `jj` is, its sub-commands (like `add`, `commit`, `push`, etc.), and their individual usage instructions.'
