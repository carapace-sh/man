documentation:
    command: '[AI] `restic dump` is a command used in the data backup and sync tool Restic. It''s responsible for creating new backups or updating existing ones. The syntax is typically: `restic dump SOURCE [ARCHIVE]`. Here, `SOURCE` refers to the local files or directories you wish to back up, and `ARCHIVE` specifies an existing archive where the data will be stored or appended. It''s important to note that for new archives, both `SOURCE` and `ARCHIVE` arguments need to be provided. Updating existing archives only requires the `ARCHIVE` argument.'
    flag:
        archive: |-
            [AI] The `restic dump --archive` command is a part of the `restic` data backup and synchronization tool. It is used to create an archive of previously backed up data.

            When you run `restic dump`, it reads your repository and all snapshots, extracts the changed files from the most recent snapshot, compresses them, and writes the result to standard output or a file specified by the user. The `--archive` flag tells restic to create an archive format output instead of individual files.

            This means that data is written in a single, streamable archive containing all the changed files since the last backup, making it easier to transfer large backups over network connections or store them in object storage systems like S3.
        host: '[AI] `restic dump --host` is a command from the backup tool `restic`. This specific command is used to initiate an export of encrypted and compressed backups stored in a remote repository, which can be accessed using the provided `--host` flag with the IP address or domain name of the server where the repository is hosted. The exported data is written to standard output (stdout) or a specified local file.'
        path: '[AI] `restic dump --path` is a command used in the data backup and sync tool called `restic`. The `dump` subcommand is responsible for creating backups of files or directories, while `--path` specifies the location of the data to be backed up. In summary, `restic dump --path <PATH>` creates a backup of the files or directories located at the specified path (`<PATH>`) using restic.'
        tag: '[AI] `restic dump --tag` is a command from the data backup and sync tool called restic. The `dump` subcommand is used to create a new backup of the data, while the `--tag` option specifies a custom tag or label for the backup. This allows users to easily identify and manage backups based on their tags when performing actions like listing, restoring, or deleting backups later.'
