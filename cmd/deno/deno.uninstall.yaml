            [AI] The `deno uninstall` command is a Deno (a modern JavaScript runtime) utility used to uninstall installed packages or dependencies. Running `deno uninstall --help` displays the detailed help information for this command. This help text includes the following key points:

            - Description: Uninstalls the specified package from the Deno cache.
            - Usage: `deno uninstall <package> [<version>]`, where `<package>` is the name of the package to be uninstalled and `<version>` (optional) specifies the exact version to be removed.
            - Global flag: The `--all` global flag can be used to remove all instances of a given package from your project, including those declared in `deno.json`, `deno.lock`, or imported directly in your Deno scripts.
            - Examples: `deno uninstall @std/math`, `deno uninstall my_package@1.2.3`.
        quiet: '[AI] `deno uninstall` is a command-line tool provided by Deno, a modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. The `--quiet` option is used to suppress output during the execution of the command. When you run `deno uninstall --quiet`, it will remove any previously installed Deno packages or configurations silently without displaying progress messages or confirmation prompts.'
        root: '[AI] The `deno uninstall` command with the `--root` flag is used to uninstall Deno, a modern JavaScript runtime, from your system. The `--root` flag specifies that you want to remove the global Deno installation rather than uninstalling it only from the current user profile. This command will delete the Deno binary and configuration files associated with the global installation.'
        unstable: '[AI] `deno uninstall --unstable` is a command used in Deno, a modern and secure TypeScript runtime. This command is utilized to remove unstable or beta Deno versions from your system. The `--unstable` flag specifies that you want to uninstall the unstable branches of Deno, ensuring that your system only runs on the stable release.'
