        [AI] `pkg uninstall` is a command used in the pkg package manager for the OpenBSD operating system. This command is utilized to remove previously installed packages and their associated files from your system. The basic syntax of this command is:

        ```bash
        pkg uninstall <package-name>
        ```

        Replace `<package-name>` with the actual name of the package you want to remove. This command will first check if there are any dependencies linked to the package being uninstalled, and if so, it will ask for confirmation before proceeding with the removal process. By default, this command does not forcefully remove packages; instead, it relies on the dependency resolution mechanism to ensure that no necessary components will be inadvertently deleted. If you want to ignore dependency checks and force an uninstallation regardless of the consequences, use the `-f` or `--force` option:

        ```bash
        pkg uninstall <package-name> -f
        ```
