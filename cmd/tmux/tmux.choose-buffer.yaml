    command: |-
        [AI] `tmux choose-buffer` is a TMUX command used to display a list of available session buffers and allow users to select one. This command can be useful when working with multiple sessions or windows within TMUX, as it enables quick switching between them without having to remember the exact window title or session name.

        When you run `tmux choose-buffer`, TMUX displays a menu with a numbered list of available buffers, which correspond to the sessions and windows within your TMUX environment. You can then navigate through the list using the arrow keys or by typing the corresponding number, and press enter to select the desired buffer and switch to it. This command is particularly useful when managing multiple sessions or when trying to find a specific window within a large number of open ones.
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `tmux choose-buffer` is a TMUX command that allows you to select and switch between available buffers (Windows with multiple panes) in your current session. The `-F` option modifies the format of the output displayed during the selection process. This can be useful for customizing the look of the prompt or adding additional information, such as buffer names or indices. For instance, you could use a format string like `"#I: #S"` to display the index (`#I`) and name (`#S`) of each buffer during selection.'
        K: '[AI] `tmux choose-buffer` is a tmux command used to select among multiple attached buffers or windows. The option `-K` specifies the key binding to be used for invoking this feature. Therefore, the command `tmux choose-buffer -K <key>` allows the user to customize the key binding for choosing among available buffers in tmux.'
        "N": '[AI] The `tmux` command `choose-buffer -N` is used to display a list of available session buffers in the current `tmux` server and allow the user to select one by number input. The `-N` flag indicates that the buffer list should be displayed numerically, without any additional information such as window titles or status. This can make selection faster when working with many buffers.'
        O: '[AI] `tmux choose-buffer` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that allows you to select among available session buffers. The `-O` option modifies the output format of the command, making it display the list of buffers in an ordered way instead of the default random order. This can be useful when dealing with numerous buffers and wanting to identify them more easily based on their logical organization.'
        Z: '[AI] `tmux choose-buffer` is a Tmux command used to display a list of available session buffers in the current terminal window. The `-Z` flag modifies the display mode, making it run in a low-latency, non-interactive way, allowing other foreground processes to use the terminal freely. Therefore, using `tmux choose-buffer -Z` will display the list of buffers without waiting for user input.'
        f: '[AI] `tmux choose-buffer` is a tmux command used to allow the user to select among multiple attached buffers or windows. The `-f` option, when used with this command, forces tmux to display only the names of the buffers and not their status information (e.g., pane count, session name). This can make the buffer selection list more concise and easier to navigate.'
        r: '[AI] The `tmux` command `choose-buffer -r` is used to display a list of available session buffers in the TMUX terminal multiplexer and allow the user to select one interactively. The `-r` flag stands for "reverse-video", which means that the selected item will be highlighted with reversed video (dark text on a light background). When you run this command, tmux displays the list of buffers in a selectable menu and waits for user input to make a selection. After the user makes a choice, tmux switches to the corresponding buffer.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux choose-buffer` is a tmux command used to interactively select and switch to a pane or window showing a specific buffer or session in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. The `-t` option is used to specify the target-session or target-window title to filter the list of available buffers for selection. For example, `tmux choose-buffer -t "my_session:my_window"` would display a list of buffers associated with that specific session and window title, allowing you to select and switch to the desired buffer.'
