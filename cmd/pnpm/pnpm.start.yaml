documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pnpm start` is a command used with PnPM, a package manager for JavaScript projects. It is equivalent to `npm start` in npm, but provides additional features like parallel installs and faster build caches. When you run `pnpm start`, it will find the script named "start" in your `package.json` file and execute it automatically. This is commonly used for running development servers or tests.'
