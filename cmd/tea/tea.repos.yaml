documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea repos` command is used in the TEA (Temporal Evolution and Analysis) tool, which is a data versioning system for time-evolving data. This command lists all the available repositories (datasets) under the given TEA installation directory.'
    flag:
        fields: '[AI] `tea repos --fields` is a command used in the TeaDB tool for Git data management. This command retrieves information about Git repositories but only returns specific fields or columns of data, as specified by the `--fields` option. It helps to streamline output and focus on relevant information for further analysis or processing.'
        limit: '[AI] The `tea repos --limit` command is used in the Tea interface for Git management. It fetches a specified number of repository definitions from remote repositories, allowing users to limit the number of repositories that are synced at once. This can be useful when dealing with large numbers of repositories or when wanting to perform an action on a subset of repositories. The `--limit` option specifies the maximum number of repository definitions to fetch.'
        login: '[AI] The `tea repos --login` command is used in the Tectonic (now Red Hat OpenShift) CLI (command-line interface). It is used to log in to a specific OpenShift cluster using your chosen authentication method, typically OAuth or a certificate. The `--login` flag indicates that this command is used for logging in and not just retrieving information about the repositories available in the cluster. After logging in successfully, you can perform various operations such as creating or managing applications on the OpenShift platform.'
        output: '[AI] The `tea repos --output` command is used with the Teapot version control system. It lists the currently registered repositories and outputs the results to standard output, which can be further processed by other tools or scripts.'
        page: '[AI] The `tea repos --page` command is used in the TeaDB database management tool to list repositories, displaying one page of results at a time. It is typically employed when dealing with a large number of repositories to make the output more manageable and easier to navigate through.'
        starred: '[AI] The `tea repos --starred` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used in version control with Git. This command lists all of your starred repositories within your GitHub account. A "star" on GitHub functions as a way to save or favorite a repository for easy access at a later time. The output of this command will be a list of repository names and their corresponding URLs.'
        type: '[AI] The `tea repos --type` command is used in the TeaDB SQL database management system to list repositories of a specific type. The `--type` option filters the output to only display repositories of that type, such as "local", "remote", or "shared". This command helps users manage and organize their TeaDB repositories based on their desired configuration.'
        watched: '[AI] The `tea repos --watched` command is used in the Tectonic (now Docker for Kubernetes) toolkit to list the Git repositories that are being monitored for changes in a watched namespace. The flag `--watched` filters the output to only show those repositories where there''s an active Git webhook, meaning any push or commit event will trigger a new deployment in that namespace.'
