    command: '[AI] `newrelic workload update` is a New Relic command used to modify the configuration of a specific workload in New Relic Infrastructure. Workloads represent infrastructure components like servers, containers, or services, and this command can be used to update their metadata such as name, tags, or associated application. This command helps maintain accurate and up-to-date information within the New Relic Infrastructure platform for effective monitoring and management.'
    flag:
        entityGuid: '[AI] The `newrelic workload update --entityGuid` command is used in New Relic''s command-line interface (CLI) to update the configuration of a specific application or infrastructure entity based on its EntityGUID. This GUID is a unique identifier for each monitored entity in New Relic. The `update` action allows you to modify various aspects of the monitored entity, such as its name, environment type, or integration settings. By providing the EntityGUID with this command, you can efficiently and accurately update specific entities under your New Relic account.'
        entitySearchQuery: |-
            [AI] The `newrelic workload update --entity-search-query` command is used in New Relic's CLI (Command Line Interface) to filter and update workloads based on specific search criteria.

            The `--entity-search-query` option takes a query string that defines the search conditions for selecting the targeted workloads. This could include various attributes like application name, environment, version, or even more complex queries using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) and filters (e.g., `app:myAppName AND env:production NOT version:"v1.0.*"`).

            The command updates the selected workloads with the new configuration, such as application settings, infrastructure configurations, or other relevant properties. By using this command effectively, you can efficiently manage your New Relic workloads without having to manually update them one by one.
        guid: '[AI] The `newrelic workload update --guid` command is used in New Relic''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool to update a specific workload, identified by its unique identifier or GUID, in the New Relic platform. Workloads represent sets of application components monitored by New Relic. Updating a workload using this command can modify its settings, such as adding or removing applications, changing data collection modes, or adjusting thresholds for notifications. The changes are applied to the specified workload only.'
        name: '[AI] The `newrelic workload update` command is used to modify the configuration of a New Relic application performance monitoring workload, which monitors the performance of web applications or services. The `--name` option specifies the name or label for the workload being updated. This flag is required and indicates to the system which specific workload to modify among multiple workloads that may be configured within an account.'
        scopeAccountIds: '[AI] The `newrelic workload update --scope AccountIds` command is used in New Relic, a software analytics company''s CLI tool. This command updates the workload configurations for the specified New Relic accounts by providing a list of account IDs as an argument. It helps manage and optimize application performance monitoring across multiple accounts within the same organization.'
