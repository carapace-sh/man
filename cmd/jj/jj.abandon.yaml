    command: '[AI] The `jj abandon` command is used in Git to discard all changes made in the current working directory and move back to the last commit without saving any modifications. Effectively, it resets the repository to its previous state.'

            [AI] The `jj abandon --help` command is used in Jupyter Notebook to abandon or discard changes made in a notebook without committing them to the version history. When run with the `--help` option, it displays detailed help information about this command, including its usage and available options.

            Here's a brief explanation of the help output:

            - The command name is `jj abandon`.
            - It is used to "abandon changes in cells".
            - When run without any options, it will abandon changes in all cells of the current notebook.
            - To abandon changes in specific cells, use the `--cell` option followed by the cell numbers or names (e.g., `--cell 1,3,5-7`).
            - You can also abandon changes in a specified branch or commit using the `--commit` option and the commit hash or branch name.
            - The command does not delete the notebook file; it only discards the local changes.
            - To confirm the action, you'll be prompted for a confirmation message. If you provide one, it will be saved as a commit message.

            Overall, `jj abandon --help` is a useful command when you want to revert your notebook to an earlier state without losing your work permanently.
        summary: '[AI] `jj abandon --summary` is a command used in the Jupyter Notebook interactive debugging tool, Jupyter''s JS Helper (jj), to give up debugging the current cell and display a summary of the changes made during the debugging session. No further code execution occurs. This command is helpful when you want to discard the changes made during the debugging session without applying them to the notebook.'
