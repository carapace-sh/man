documentation:
    command: '[AI] `rustup target list` is a Rust programming language command used to display the list of available targets for compilation. Rust supports cross-compilation for various platforms and architectures. This command shows you which targets are currently installed in your Rust setup, allowing you to choose the appropriate one for your project''s needs.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `rustup target list --help` is a Rust command that displays help information for the `target list` sub-command of Rust''s package manager, `rustup`. This command lists the currently activated Rust targets (i.e., triples specifying the host and target architectures and OSes) in your Rust development environment. Running `--help` with this command provides detailed information on how to use this command to list or manipulate the active targets, as well as available options for filtering, sorting, and other functionalities.'
        installed: '[AI] `rustup target list --installed` is a Rust tool command that displays a list of Rust compilation targets that are currently installed on your system. These targets represent different architectures and operating systems for which Rust code can be compiled. The flag `--installed` filters the output to show only those targets that have already been installed with rustup, Rust''s package manager.'
        toolchain: '[AI] `rustup target list --toolchain` is a Rust command that displays a list of the Rust toolchains (each identified by its name and Rust version) currently available in your Rust installation managed by Rustup. It does not list targets (like x86\_64-pc-windows-msvc or x86\_64-apple-darwin), but rather the toolchains that can be used to build those targets.'
