    command: '[AI] `localectl` is a command-line utility in Linux systems for managing regional and localization settings, including time zones, keyboard layouts, and language preferences. It allows users to query, set, or modify system locale configurations without requiring a reboot. It''s part of the `localization` package (usually called `locales`) and interacts with the system''s `locale-gen` and `keyboard-configuration` packages.'

            [AI] `localectl` is a command-line utility in systemd-based Linux distributions for managing system localization and regional settings. The `--help` option provides a brief summary of available commands and their usage:

            ```
            Usage: localectype [OPTIONS] [--quiet|--verbose] [--file FILENAME] [COMMAND]

            You can use this information to check the available commands, their usage, and options for `localectl`.
        host: '[AI] `localectl --host` is a command used in Linux systems to manage language and regional settings for a specific machine or host, rather than the local system. It''s part of the `localization` subsystem and can be used to query or set the locale information for a remote system over SSH or other network connections. This can be useful when managing multiple machines with consistent locale configurations.'
        machine: '[AI] `localectl --machine` is a command used in Systemd-based Linux distributions, such as Fedora and Ubuntu Server, to manage localization settings for remote systems over the network. The `--machine` option specifies the name or IP address of the target machine where you want to apply the localization settings. By using this command, system administrators can configure language, keyboard layout, timezone, and other regional settings across multiple machines in their infrastructure from a single workstation.'
        no-ask-password: '[AI] `localectl` is a command-line utility for managing system localization settings in Systemd-based Linux distributions. The option `--no-ask-password` disables the need for entering the user password when making changes that require administrative privileges. This flag allows you to run certain localectl commands with elevated permissions without being prompted for confirmation.'
        no-convert: '[AI] `localectl --no-convert` is a command used in Linux systems to manipulate locale and keyboard settings. The `--no-convert` option instructs the localization subsystem not to automatically convert or apply any new settings, allowing manual intervention before applying changes that could potentially affect systemwide configurations or user sessions adversely. This can be useful for testing or troubleshooting specific locale or keyboard settings without affecting the entire system at once.'
        no-pager: '[AI] `localectl --no-pager` is a command used in Linux systems to manipulate locale and keyboard settings. The `--no-pager` option is used to prevent the output from being piped through a pager such as less or more, causing it to be displayed directly in the terminal instead. This can be useful when dealing with large amounts of data or when working interactively in a terminal session.'
        version: '[AI] `localectl --version` is a command used in Linux systems to check the version of the `localectl` utility. It''s part of the `glibc-utils` or `icu-devtools` package, which provides internationalization support for your system. Running this command displays the version number and any other relevant build information, ensuring you have the latest updates for proper language and locale handling.'
