name: vendor
description: Manages vendored Terraform modules
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `terraform experimental vendor` command is used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, to enable the use of third-party providers that are not yet released or fully supported by Hashicorp. This command updates your Terraform configuration to use the specified experimental provider registry URL instead of the default Hashicorp registry. By doing so, you can access and experiment with new features or functionality that are still under development. However, it''s important to note that using experimental providers may introduce compatibility issues, breaking changes, or other risks that could impact your infrastructure deployments.'
