documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker-compose rm` command is used to remove one or more containers, networks, or images defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. By default, it removes the associated containers only. If you want to remove an image that is still in use by other containers, you need to use the `--force` option. To specify which services or containers to remove, use the service name or container ID as an argument. For example: `docker-compose rm my_service`.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `docker-compose rm --all` is a command used to remove all containers, networks, and images defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. This command is typically used when you want to clean up your Docker environment completely and start fresh. It does not affect any volumes or networks that are not scoped to the specific compose file being used.'
        force: '[AI] `docker-compose rm --force` is a command used with Docker Compose to remove one or more containers, networks, or services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. The `--force` option is used to remove containers even if they are running. This means that all data contained within the containers will be lost. This command is often used when you want to completely remove and recreate a container or service, for example, when making changes to a Docker Compose file or when troubleshooting issues.'
        stop: '[AI] `docker-compose rm --stop` is a command used to remove containers, networks, and images defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file with a graceful stop. The `rm` flag indicates removal of the specified services or containers, while `--stop` ensures that the running containers are stopped before they are removed to prevent data loss or other issues. This command does not remove volumes associated with the containers unless explicitly specified using the `-v` option.'
        volumes: '[AI] `docker-compose rm --volumes` is a command used to remove Docker containers, networks, and volumes defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. The `--volumes` option specifically removes any associated Docker volumes. Once removed, the data stored in those volumes will be lost unless they have been backed up elsewhere. This command is often used when it''s no longer necessary to keep certain containers and their associated data.'
