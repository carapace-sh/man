documentation:
    command: '[AI] Picard is a popular bioinformatics tool developed by the Broad Institute. It provides a set of data analysis tools for SAM and BAM format files, which are commonly used in next-gen sequencing data analysis. Picard''s features include sorting, marking duplicates, adding read groups, converting file formats, fixing metadata issues, and more. These functionalities facilitate efficient and accurate processing of high-throughput sequencing data.'
    flag:
        config-file: |-
            [AI] The `--config-file` option in Picard, a bioinformatics tool by the Broad Institute, is used to specify a custom configuration file instead of using Picard's default settings. This can be useful when running large-scale analyses or when applying specific processing steps that require particular configurations.

            The provided configuration file (in JSON format) should contain key-value pairs defining various options and their respective values. By using this option, users can customize the behavior of Picard tools to better fit their data and analysis needs.
        debug: '[AI] The `picard` command is a collection of bioinformatics tools developed by the Broad Institute. The `--debug` flag is an option that can be used with some of these tools to enable more detailed output and diagnostics, making it easier to identify and resolve issues during data analysis. When used, this flag typically causes the tool to print additional information about its progress and internal processes, which can be helpful for troubleshooting and understanding the behavior of the tool in specific use cases. Keep in mind that enabling debug mode might increase output and potentially slow down processing time.'
        help: '[AI] `picard --help` is a command used in bioinformatics with the Picard toolkit. It displays comprehensive help information about all available Picard tools and their usage. The output includes a brief description of each tool, its syntax, and various options that can be used. This command allows users to quickly access information on how to run each tool effectively.'
        long-version: '[AI] `picard` is a set of command-line tools for analyzing next-generation sequencing data. The command `picard --long-version` is used to display detailed version information about all installed `picard` components, including their name, version number, and build date. This can be useful for ensuring that the correct versions of each tool are being used in a bioinformatics workflow and for troubleshooting compatibility issues between different tools or software environments.'
        no-player: '[AI] `picard --no-player` is a command-line tool from the Picard Toolkit used in bioinformatics data analysis. The `--no-player` option disables the use of Picard''s built-in "Picard Output Adjustment" (also known as "Player") component. This option is useful when running Picard tools in automated pipelines or scripts where no user interaction is required, allowing for uninterrupted execution.'
        no-plugins: '[AI] `picard` is a set of software tools for analysis and manipulation of large bioinformatics datasets, specifically designed for use with the Broad Institute''s Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK). The command `picard --no-plugins` instructs Picard to be run without loading any additional plugins. This means that only the core Picard functions will be available, and no plugins specific functionality will be accessible. This can be useful in cases where you want to minimize the memory footprint of your analysis or when troubleshooting issues related to plugin compatibility.'
        no-restore: '[AI] `picard --no-restore` is a command from the Picard Toolkit used in bioinformatics data analysis. The `--no-restore` option instructs Picard not to restore previously saved checkpoints during its execution. This can result in faster processing but also means that no previous state of the analysis can be recovered if something goes wrong during the current run.'
        version: '[AI] `picard --version` is a command used in bioinformatics to check the version number of Picard Tools, an open-source data analysis software suite written primarily in Java for the Genomic Data Analysis pipeline. The command executes the Picard program with the "--version" argument, which returns information about the installed Picard Tools'' major and minor version numbers, as well as the build date and Git commit ID if applicable.'
