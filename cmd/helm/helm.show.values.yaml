    --version=: specify a version constraint for the chart version to use. This constraint can be a specific tag (e.g. 1.1.1) or it may reference a valid range (e.g. ^2.0.0). If this is not specified, the latest version is used
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `helm show values` command is used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager, to display the current values and configuration settings of a specific Helm chart. When you run this command followed by the name of a chart or release, it will output the key-value pairs of the override values applied to that chart. This can be helpful for checking the current state of your application''s configuration without having to deploy or edit files directly.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] `helm show values` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to display the current values of configurations for a specified chart or release. The option `--ca-file <path>` specifies a custom SSL certificate authority (CA) file to use when making HTTPS requests to the Helm repository servers. This is useful in secure environments where the default CA files may not be trusted, and you want to use your own trusted CA for verification of server certificates.'
        cert-file: '[AI] The `helm show values` command is used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager, to display the current values of a Helm chart. The option `--cert-file` specifies the path to a certificate file to use for secure communication with the Tiller server (Helm''s REST API server) when it''s running in an insecure environment. This helps ensure that the communication between your local machine and the Tiller server is encrypted.'
        devel: '[AI] `helm show values --devel` is a Helm command used to display the current values for a Helm chart, including any overrides and defaults that have been applied. The `--devel` flag is optional and it''s used when working in the development environment of a Helm chart. With this flag enabled, Helm will show values from both the stable (released) and developing branches of the chart repository, allowing developers to see any changes made in the development process before merging them into the stable branch.'
        insecure-skip-tls-verify: '[AI] The `helm show values` command is used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to display the current values of a Helm chart. The `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` flag is an optional argument that disables TLS certificate verification during the connection between Helm and the remote chart repository or chart archive. This means that Helm will trust any SSL certificate presented without checking its validity, which can pose a security risk if used with untrusted sources. It''s recommended to use this flag only in trusted environments.'
        jsonpath: |-
            [AI] `helm show values` is a Helm command used to display the current values for a given Helm chart. The `--jsonpath` option is used with this command to extract specific JSON data from the output.

            For instance, if you want to get the value of a particular config map key in the Helm chart, you can use the following command:

            ```bash
            helm show values <chart-name> --jsonpath='.values.configMaps.<configMapName>.data.<key>'
            ```

            Replace `<chart-name>`, `<configMapName>`, and `<key>` with the actual chart name, config map name, and key value respectively. This command will display the JSON data for the specified value in the output.
        key-file: '[AI] `helm show values` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to display the current values of a Helm chart. The option `--key-file` is used to provide a path to a key file for accessing encrypted values in the chart''s values.yaml file. When using this option, Helm will decrypt the encrypted values using the provided key file and display them. This feature ensures secure storage of sensitive information while still being able to view it when needed.'
        keyring: '[AI] `helm show values --keyring` is a Helm command used to display the values in a Helm chart, specifically the location and contents of the keyring file. A Helm keyring is a secure storage for holding sensitive data such as TLS certificates, API keys, or passwords, which can be used to encrypt and decrypt values in Helm charts. The `--keyring` flag allows you to see where Helm stores the keyring file and its contents without deploying or installing the chart.'
        pass-credentials: '[AI] `helm show values` is a Helm command used to display the current values of a specified Helm chart. The `--pass-credentials` option is used to securely provide Helm with Kubernetes auth credentials for accessing a remote Helm repository or for interacting with a Helm release on a remote Kubernetes cluster, without having to hardcode them in plaintext in the command line. These credentials can be provided through various methods such as a Helm file, KubeConfig file, or a Helm Tiller server certificate and key. Using `--pass-credentials` helps maintain security best practices by keeping sensitive information out of version control systems and public logs.'
        password: '[AI] `helm show values` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. It displays the current values of a Helm chart, which defines the configuration for a Kubernetes application. The `--password` flag is not a standard option for this command. If you see it being used, it''s likely a mistake or an obsolete option from older Helm versions. In recent Helm releases, sensitive information such as passwords should be stored in Kubernetes Secrets or other secure methods, not passed as command-line arguments.'
        repo: '[AI] `helm show values --repo` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes. This command displays the values defined in a specific Helm chart repository, without installing or applying the chart. The `--repo` option specifies the name of the Helm repository containing the desired chart. By using this command, you can inspect and understand the configuration options available in a given Helm chart before deploying it to your Kubernetes cluster.'
        username: '[AI] The `helm show values` command is used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager, to display the current values of configuration parameters for a specific Helm chart or release. The `--username` option is an argument provided with this command for specifying a username when accessing values from a Helm repository that requires authentication. With `--username`, you can authenticate and view the values of a private Helm chart without having to install it first.'
        verify: '[AI] `helm show values --verify` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to display the current values of configurations for a specific Helm chart without installing or upgrading it. The `--verify` flag performs an extra step to validate that the provided YAML or property file values are valid against the schema defined in the Helm chart. This ensures that any changes made to the values file adhere to the expected format and structure before applying them.'
        version: '[AI] `helm show values --version` is a command used with Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes. This command displays the current version of the Helm values file associated with a specific release or chart. It does not modify or update any configuration, it only shows the version information.'
