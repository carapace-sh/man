documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux save-buffer` command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, saves the contents of the current pane or window to a file. By default, it saves the buffer in a new file with a name based on the session and pane or window index. If no file name is provided, the command will prompt for one. This can be useful for saving the state of a complex terminal setup for later use.'
    flag:
        a: '[AI] `tmux save-buffer` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that saves the contents of an active pane or window to a file. The `-a` option appends the output to the file instead of overwriting it. Therefore, `tmux save-buffer -a <window-or-pane-identifier>` saves and appends the content of the specified Tmux window or pane to a file.'
        b: '[AI] `tmux save-buffer` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer, used to save the contents of an active pane or window into a named buffer. The `-b` option specifies that the new buffer should be named by providing a argument after the option. For example, `tmux save-buffer -b my_buffer` saves the current pane''s content into a buffer named "my\_buffer". These buffers can later be restored using the `load-buffer` command.'
