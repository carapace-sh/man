documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker image prune` is a command used to remove unused and dangling images from a Docker host. It helps in managing disk space by eliminating images that are no longer needed but still occupying space in the Docker image repository. This command does not affect running containers or their associated images. Additionally, it can be combined with `-a` or `--all` flag to remove unused containers and networks as well.'
    flag:
        all: |-
            [AI] The `docker image prune --all` command is used to remove unused or dangling Docker images from your local system. When you run this command with the `--all` flag, Docker will delete:

            1. All builder images that are no longer in use (i.e., not referenced by any other image).
            2. All intermediate images that have no top-level image (i.e., parent images without children).
            3. All dangling images (i.e., images without any tags or references).

            This command helps maintain a clean and efficient Docker environment by removing unneeded images, thus saving disk space. Always ensure you back up essential images before running this command to prevent accidentally deleting required images.
        filter: '[AI] `docker image prune --filter` is a command used to remove unused or dangling Docker images from your local registry. The `--filter` option allows you to apply specific filters to determine which images are deleted. For instance, `--filter "dangling=true"` will only delete dangling images, while `--filter "until=<date>"` will remove images not used since a specified date. These filters help in maintaining a clean and efficient Docker environment by eliminating unused images that take up disk space.'
        force: '[AI] `docker image prune --force` is a command used in Docker to remove unused and dangling images from the local Docker registry. The `--force` option is used to force the removal of images without any confirmation prompts. In other words, it permanently deletes the selected images instead of just removing their references. This command helps keep your Docker environment clean and efficient by reducing the disk space occupied by unnecessary images.'
