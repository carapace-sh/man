documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint release list` command is used in Docker and Kubernetes to list all the available releases (versions) of a particular Waypoint application. Waypoint is a DevOps tool by Microsoft that simplifies building, releasing, and managing applications using GitHub Actions or Kubernetes. By running this command, you''ll get a list of release names, tags, and their corresponding images, enabling you to choose the desired release for further actions such as deploying.'
    flag:
        desc: '[AI] The `waypoint release list --desc` command is used in Kubernetes using the Waypoint tool. It displays a description or details of each release in the Waypoint-managed application list. The output includes the release name, version, and creation time. It helps to quickly identify and understand the state of each deployment in the system.'
        json: '[AI] The `waypoint release list --json` command is used in Google Cloud''s Kubernetes engine, Waypoint, to retrieve a list of releases in JSON format. A release in Waypoint represents a set of changes that have been proposed or approved for deployment to a specific environment, such as staging or production. By specifying the `--json` flag, Waypoint returns the output in JSON format, enabling easy integration with other tools and automation workflows that expect or process JSON data.'
        limit: '[AI] The `waypoint release list --limit` command in Kubernetes is used to list out the names of a specified number of releases managed by Waypoint, which is a GitOps rollout tool for Kubernetes. The `--limit` flag sets the maximum number of releases to be displayed in the output.'
        long-ids: '[AI] The `waypoint release list --long-ids` command is used in Kubernetes to display a list of all released Waypoints (canary or shadow) for a specific Kubernetes resource with their unique long IDs. Waypoints are a feature provided by the Canary and Kubernetes Rollouts packages, which help manage progressive deployments and rollbacks of applications in a controlled manner. By using this command with the `--long-ids` flag, you will get an output that includes each waypoint''s long ID, providing a clear identification for each individual release.'
        order-by: '[AI] The `waypoint release list --order-by` command is used in Kubernetes'' Waypoint tool to list out the releases in a specific order. The `--order-by` option specifies the sorting criterion, which can be either "NAME" (to list releases in alphabetical order) or "AGE" (to list releases in order of their creation time). This command helps users manage their Kubernetes releases effectively by providing a clear and organized view.'
        physical-state: '[AI] The `waypoint release list --physical-state` command is used in Robot Operating System (ROS) Waypoint navigation. It prints out a list of currently released waypoints, including their indices and physical states (e.g., "REACHED" or "ACTIVE"). Released waypoints are those that have been sent to the robot for following. This command provides useful feedback about the progress of the robot through its planned path.'
        state: '[AI] The `waypoint release list --state` command is used in Kubernetes with the Waypoint application management tool. This command lists all the releases managed by Waypoint, displaying their current states (such as stable, preview, or canary) for each one. It helps users to quickly check the status of their applications'' deployments and rollouts.'
        url: '[AI] The `waypoint release list --url` command is used in Kubernetes to retrieve the URLs of released versions for a given Waypoint application. Waypoint is a GitOps tool for building, releasing, and managing applications on Kubernetes. This command returns a JSON object containing a list of releases with their version numbers and URLs where the release artifacts are stored. It helps in keeping track of available releases and retrieving the URL to access the release when needed.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `waypoint release list --verbose` command is used in Kubernetes to list out the details of all released versions of a particular Kubernetes application managed by Waypoint, an open-source GitOps tool. The `--verbose` flag increases the output detail level, providing more extensive information about each release such as its status (running, failed, etc.), creation and update timestamps, and associated Kubernetes resources like deployments and services.'
        workspace-all: '[AI] The `waypoint release list --workspace-all` command is used with Google Cloud''s Waypoint tool for managing Kubernetes applications. This command lists all the releases (deployments) in all workspaces within the current Waypoint workspace. It provides a comprehensive view of all deployed applications across multiple environments or projects.'
