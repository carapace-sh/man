documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git bisect replay` is a Git command used to resume a previously interrupted bisect session. Bisect is a Git feature for finding the commit that introduced a bug or regression in your project''s codebase. When you run `git bisect replay`, Git will continue the process of testing commits from the current good state (the point where your project was working correctly) and the bad state (where it has the issue), automatically checking out each commit, running tests, and moving forward if the test passes or backward if it fails until it identifies the offending commit.'
