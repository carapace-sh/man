documentation:
    command: '[AI] `lnav` is not a standard Unix or Linux command. It might be a typo or an abbreviation for other tools like Logstash, which is a data collection engine developed by Elastic. Logstash uses the `input { lnabfile <path> }` configuration to read log files. If you meant Logstash, then this command configures Logstash to read logs from the specified file path.'
    flag:
        C: '[AI] `lnav` is a tool for indexing and searching log data in real time. The option `-C` sets up `lnav` to operate in cluster mode, allowing multiple instances of `lnav` to work together to index and search logs across a distributed system. This flag configures `lnav` to communicate with other `lnav` instances using the Logstash Plugin API, enabling them to share indices and searches for improved performance and scalability.'
        H: '[AI] The `lnav` command is a tool for processing and filtering log files in real time. The option `-H` (or `--uppercase-headers`) is used to output header lines in uppercase characters. This can be helpful when parsing logs where the first line contains header information, making it easier to distinguish between data and metadata.'
        I: '[AI] `lnav` is a tool for indexing and searching log files in near real-time. The option `-I` or `--index-path` is used to specify the location where `lnav` should create and manage its indexes for fast searches. When you run `lnav -I <path>`, it will index logs located under specified path, and make them searchable.'
        R: '[AI] `lnav` is a tool from Logstash project, used for filtering and aggregating log events in real time. The option `-R` or `--recursive` tells `lnav` to process files recursively in directories and their subdirectories. This means that when you use this option with a command like `lnav filter /path/to/log/directory`, it will read logs not only from the specified directory, but also from all nested ones, making it easier to collect logs from an entire system or application stack.'
        V: '[AI] `lnav` is a lightweight, high-performance logging pipeline developed by Elastic. The command `lnav -V` is used to display version information about `lnav`. This includes the major and minor version numbers as well as any build metadata such as the commit hash or tag.'
        a: '[AI] `lnav` is a tool from Logstash in Elasticsearch Stack, used for filtering and aggregating logs in real-time or near real-time. The option `-a` (or `--auto-discover`) is used to enable automatic discovery of input plugins. It tells lnav to scan the local directories and configuration files looking for input definitions, allowing you to add new inputs without modifying the configuration file directly. This makes it easier to dynamically add or remove data sources, making your log ingestion more flexible and dynamic.'
        c: '[AI] `lnav` is a log processing pipeline tool developed by Elastic. The option `-c` or `--count` sets the maximum number of log events processed in each batch. This can be useful for controlling resource usage or to limit the amount of data being processed at once. The flag takes an integer value as argument.'
        d: '[AI] `lnav` is a tool used for filtering and aggregating log events from various sources. The option `-d` or `--discard` in `lnav` is used to discard log events that match certain conditions without outputting them. It''s essentially an action to drop logs, helping to reduce the amount of data processed further, and potentially saving storage space and improving performance.'
        f: '[AI] `lnav` is a tool from Logstash community, used for filtering and processing log events in real time. The option `-f` or `--configfile` is used to specify the path of the configuration file that defines the input sources, filters, and output plugins for `lnav`. When using this flag, `lnav` reads the configuration file at startup and applies the defined pipelines.'
        h: '[AI] `lnav` is a tool for filtering and aggregating log events in real time, developed by Elastic. The option `-h` or `--help` is a common command-line argument used to display help information about a given command or tool. In the context of `lnav`, using `lnav -h` will show you a detailed help message explaining how to use the `lnav` command, its various options and arguments, and their meanings.'
        i: '[AI] `lnav` is a tool from the Logstash family in Elastic Stack, used for live streaming and filtering logs. The option `-i` or `--index` specifies an index name or a path to a file that contains index names to use for the input plugin. It instructs `lnav` to send events to or read from log files indexed under those names in Elastic Stack.'
        "n": '[AI] `lnav` is a tool from the Logstash project, used for filtering and aggregating log events in real time. The option `-n` passed to this command disables the use of named pipelines. This means that any configuration file referenced by `lnav` will not be loaded and the command will instead read logs directly from their standard input.'
        q: '[AI] `lnav` is a tool from the Logstash project for live streaming logs and events from various sources to Elasticsearch or Logstash. The option `-q` is used to enable quiet mode, which reduces the amount of output that `lnav` generates when running. In quiet mode, only error messages are printed to the console, making it useful when running multiple instances of `lnav` in the background or automating the log ingestion process.'
        r: |-
            [AI] `lnav` is a tool used for filtering, parsing, and aggregating log events in real time or from files. The command `lnav -r` has the following meaning:

            * `-r` option: It stands for "realtime" mode. In this mode, `lnav` reads logs from their sources (files or stdin) in real time and processes them accordingly based on defined filters. This is useful when working with live log streams.
        t: '[AI] `lnav` is a tool from the Logstash family in Elastic Stack, used for filtering, transforming, and shipping logs. The option `-t`, or `--template`, is used to apply a template to the input events. This allows for custom parsing and conversion of log data based on predefined patterns. For instance, it can be utilized to extract specific fields and convert them into desired formats before further processing by Logstash or Elastic Search.'
        u: '[AI] `lnav` is a tool for indexing and searching log data in real time or near real time. The command `lnav -u` stands for "update", which is used to update the configuration of an existing Logstash pipeline managed by Logstash Netflow and Vazirba''s Logstash NGinx access and error logs input plugins. This can be applied when making changes to the data sources or filters in a running pipeline.'
        w: '[AI] `lnav` is a tool from the Logstash family in the Elastic Stack. The `-w` option stands for watch mode. In this mode, `lnav` continuously monitors and processes incoming logs in real time from specified files or directories without requiring a rotated file to be available. It''s useful when dealing with live log streams where data is constantly being written.'
