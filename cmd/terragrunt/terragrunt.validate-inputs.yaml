group: terragrunt
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `terraform init` command initializes your Terraform working directory by downloading necessary backend configuration and provider plugins. `terragrunt validate-inputs`, on the other hand, is a command specific to the Terragrunt tool. It validates the input arguments passed to Terragrunt before plan execution. This ensures that the inputs are correctly configured and can prevent potential errors during the Terraform application of the infrastructure changes.'
