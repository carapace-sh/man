    command: '[AI] The `npm` command `access ls-collaborators` is used to list collaborators for a given npm package, which is registered under an NPM user account. Collaborators are individuals who have been granted specific access levels (like `read`, `publish`, or `admin`) to help manage and maintain the package.
