documentation:
    command: '[AI] `consul reload` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. It triggers a rolling update of configured services, applications, or configurations while keeping the Consul agent running without downtime. This allows for making changes to the Consul configuration or registered services without having to completely restart the agent. The changes take effect as soon as each component is reloaded during the update process.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] `consul reload` is a command from the Consul service discovery and configuration tool. It is used to reapply changes to the running Consul agent without restarting it, thereby saving the time and effort required for a full restart. The `--ca-file` flag specifies a file containing trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates that should be used to validate secure communications between Consul components. This helps ensure the security of communication channels within the Consul cluster.'
        ca-path: |-
            [AI] The `consul reload --ca-path` command is used to reload a Consul configuration in a cluster environment, specifically with regards to updating the CA (Certificate Authority) certificates for secure communication between Consul servers.

            Consul uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for secure communication between its servers and clients. The `--ca-path` flag specifies the location of the CA certificates that Consul should trust when establishing encrypted connections. By using the `reload` command with this flag, you can update the CA certificates in Consul without having to restart the entire service. This allows for more frequent and agile certificate updates, enhancing security within your Consul cluster.
        client-cert: '[AI] The `consul reload --client-cert` command is used to reload configuration changes in Consul, a Connect and service discovery tool. This command requires providing a client certificate file, which is used to authenticate the communication between Consul agent and the client running this command. This way, any modifications made to the configuration files will take effect without requiring a full restart of the Consul agent.'
        client-key: '[AI] The `consul reload --client-key` command is used to reload configurations in Hashicorp Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool. The `--client-key` option specifies the authentication key of the Consul client issuing the reload command. This ensures that only authorized clients can perform configuration changes. When this command is executed, Consul will reapply the latest configuration data while maintaining the state of running services.'
        http-addr: '[AI] The `consul reload --http-addr` command is used to reload configuration changes in Hashicorp Consul, a distributed, highly-available, and data center-aware solution to connect and secure services. This command is typically issued from the Consul CLI (Command Line Interface) when modifications have been made to the Consul configuration file and those changes need to be applied without stopping and restarting the Consul agent. The `--http-addr` option sets the HTTP interface address for the agent, allowing you to specify the IP address and port number where the Consul HTTP API will listen.'
        tls-server-name: '[AI] The `consul reload --tls-server-name` command is used with Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command triggers a Configuration Reload in Consul using TLS (Transport Layer Security) with a specified server name. It allows updating the configuration of Consul agents or clients without disrupting services by reloading their configurations. The `--tls-server-name` flag specifies the TLS server certificate for the Consul agent or client, ensuring secure communication during the reload process.'
        token: '[AI] `consul reload --token` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, a tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. The `reload` sub-command is used to update the configuration of an agent without restarting it. The `--token` option specifies the token needed to authenticate the request with Consul''s HTTP API. This command allows you to make changes to your Consul setup while minimizing downtime by updating the configuration in a live environment.'
        token-file: '[AI] `consul reload --token-file` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, a Connect and Configuration Management tool. This command triggers a configuration reload in Consul without disrupting the current state of the service. The `--token-file` option specifies a file containing a valid ACL token that grants the necessary permissions to modify configurations. By using this token, you ensure that only authorized users can make changes to the Consul configurations.'
