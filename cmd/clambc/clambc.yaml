    command: '[AI] `clambc` is a compiler for the OpenCL (Open Computing Language) platform. OpenCL is a parallel computing framework that enables running computational tasks on various types of processors, including GPUs and CPUs, in order to accelerate applications and deliver faster performance. The `clambc` compiler translates OpenCL source code into machine-readable format for execution on the target hardware platform.'
    flag:
        debug: |-
            [AI] `clambc` is a compiler for the OpenCL (Open Computing Language) programming platform. The `--debug` flag is an option that can be passed to this compiler during command-line usage.

            This flag enables the generation of debug information along with the compiled OpenCL code. It enhances the diagnostic capabilities by providing more detailed error messages and other useful data, which assists in identifying issues during development and debugging.
        force-interpreter: '[AI] The `clambc` is a compiler for the LLVM Project''s intermediate representation (IR) code, which can be used to compile programs written in various programming languages that target the LLVM IR. The `--force-interpreter` flag is an option that instructs `clambc` to treat the input file as if it were an LLVM IR module meant for interpretation rather than compilation. This can be useful when debugging, testing, or interacting with the LLVM IR in an interactive environment where compilation isn''t required.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `clambc` is a compiler for the LLVM Project's BitCode. The `--help` flag is used to display detailed help information about the compiler. When you run `clambc --help`, it will print out various options and usage instructions for the compiler, including:

            1. Supported input file formats (e.g., .ll, .bc)
            2. Options for controlling optimization levels
            3. Options for specifying output files and directories
            4. Options for enabling or disabling specific passes
            5. Other miscellaneous options for controlling compilation behavior.

            Overall, using `clambc --help` is a useful way to familiarize yourself with the capabilities of the compiler and how to effectively use it for your specific needs.
        info: '[AI] `clambc` is a compiler for the OpenCL (Open Computing Language) programming platform. The command `clambc --info` is used to display various information about the OpenCL implementation, specifically the available devices and their capabilities. The output typically includes a list of devices with their names, types (CPU or GPU), vendor names, compute units/processors number, clock frequencies, maximum work-group size, etc. This command helps developers verify if their hardware is properly supported by the OpenCL compiler and to choose appropriate hardware for optimizing their code.'
        input: '[AI] `clambc` is a compiler for the LLVM Project''s C language subset, named "LLVM C++ ABI C dialect" or simply "C dialect" in some contexts. The command `clambc --input` is used to instruct the compiler to read and compile the source code file(s) provided as arguments following the `--input` flag. For instance, `clambc --input mysourcefile.c` will compile the C source file "mysourcefile.c". Multiple input files can be passed by adding multiple `--input` flags followed by the respective filenames.'
        no-trace-showsource: |-
            [AI] The `clang-compile` (often shortened to `clang`) command `--no-trace-showSource` is a compiler flag used with the LLVM-based C and C++ compiler Clang. This flag disables the generation of trace files during source code compilation.

            Trace files, also known as "gdb.mi" files, are used by the GNU Debugger (GDB) for providing custom information during debugging sessions. With `--no-trace-showSource` disabled, Clang will not produce these trace files when generating object files from source code files.

            In summary, using the flag `--no-trace-showSource` prevents Clang from generating trace files which can reduce the amount of output during compilation and may have a slight performance improvement. However, this might impact the functionality of debugging tools like GDB, as they rely on these trace files for extended information during debugging sessions.
        printbcir: '[AI] The `clambc` command with the option `--print-bcir` is a compiler for the LLVM Project''s bitcode intermediate representation (IR). This specific invocation instructs the compiler to print out the BitCode Input Representation (BIR) of the source code file(s) being compiled. In simpler terms, it prints out the BitCode format of the input files instead of compiling them into object code or another target format. The BitCode IR is a platform-independent, human-readable representation that can be processed by other LLVM tools for further optimization and analysis.'
        printsrc: '[AI] `clambc` is a compiler for the LLVM Project''s Assembly Language Interface (LLVM IR) and C language. The `--printsrc` option is a command-line argument given to this compiler. It instructs clambc to print the source code corresponding to the provided LLVM IR files or C code, instead of generating an executable or object files. This can be useful for debugging or analyzing the input code without actually building it.'
        statistics: |-
            [AI] `clambc` is a compiler for the LLVM Project, which includes the Clang C and C++ compiler. The `--statistics` flag is an option provided by Clang to generate various statistics about the compiled source code. These statistics include:

            1. Number of functions, classes, and namespaces.
            2. Size information, such as the total number of bytes of source code, compiled object files, and machine code.
            3. Optimization statistics, including the number of instructions eliminated, loop unrolled, and more.
            4. Memory usage statistics.
            5. Dependency analysis statistics.

            When you compile a project using Clang with `--statistics`, it generates an XML file (by default named `clang-stats.xml`) containing all the collected statistics. This information can be useful for understanding the size and complexity of your codebase, as well as assessing the impact of compiler optimizations.
        trace: '[AI] `clambc` is a compiler for the LLVM Project''s Compiler Infrastructure for Machine Learning (LibML). The `--trace` flag is an option used during compilation, which enables generating detailed tracing information. This data provides insights into the runtime behavior of the compiler and can be useful for debugging and profiling purposes. The generated trace files contain information such as function calls, instruction executions, memory accesses, and other low-level details that can help identify performance bottlenecks or resolve complex issues in ML models compiled with LLVM.'
        trust-bytecode: |-
            [AI] `clambc` is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for the LLVM project, specifically designed for Compiler-as-a-Service (CaaS) and Runtime Environment (RTE) use cases. The `--trust-bytecode` flag is an option that enables `clambc` to trust the bytecode it receives without performing any further validation or verification checks.

            This flag is used when the source code of the function being compiled is not available or cannot be verified, such as in the case of precompiled libraries or third-party code. Trusting the bytecode can improve performance since `clambc` doesn't have to perform additional validation steps. However, using this option comes with potential security risks as the code might contain malicious instructions or exploits that could compromise the system. Therefore, it should be used with caution and only when trust is established with the source of the bytecode.
        version: '[AI] `clambc` is a compiler for the OpenCL (Open Computing Language) standard, which allows writing code that can be executed on various parallel processing units such as GPUs or CPUs. The command `clambc --version` is used to print out the version information of the installed OpenCL compiler. It displays the version number and other relevant information like vendor name, compiler version, and OpenCL API version supported by the compiler.'
