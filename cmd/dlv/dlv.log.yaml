    command: '[AI] The `dlv log` command is used in Delve debugger (dlv) to display the debug log. This log contains various information about the ongoing debugging session, such as breakpoints hit, function calls, and other diagnostic messages. By default, the logs are printed to the standard error stream (stderr). You can redirect the output to a file or inspect it interactively using the debugger interface.'
