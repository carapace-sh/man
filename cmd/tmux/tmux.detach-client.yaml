    command: '[AI] The `tmux detach-client` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to disconnect a currently attached session, allowing you to come back to it later without keeping your terminal open. When you run this command in a TMUX session, it sends the signal to the TMUX server process to detach the client (your terminal), but keeps the session running in the background. To reattach the session later, use the `tmux attach` command with the session identifier or name.'
    flag:
        E: '[AI] `tmux detach-client -E` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. This command detaches the current client (session) in Tmux, but keeps it running in the background. The `-E` flag (or --reattach-to-session) allows you to reattach to the same session later when you''re ready to use it again. Essentially, it''s a way to minimize the impact of accidentally closing your terminal window or losing your SSH connection, as you can simply reattach to the session where you left off.'
        P: |-
            [AI] The `tmux detach-client -P` command is used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to detach the current client (session) and reattach it later with the same priority.

            When you run this command, Tmux detaches the active session or window and moves it to the background. The `-P` flag signifies that when you reattach the session later using the `tmux attach-session` command, Tmux will prioritize attaching the current client over any other sessions with the same name. This is useful when working on multiple sessions with the same name and you want to ensure you always return to the right one.
        a: '[AI] The `tmux detach-client -a` command in Tmux is used to detach all sessions (not just the current one) in the background. The `-a` option stands for "attached," indicating that all attached sessions will be detached. This allows you to free up a terminal without logging out or closing your sessions entirely. Remember, detaching doesn''t close the session; it only disconnects you as the user. When needed, you can reattach to your detached sessions using the `tmux attach` command.'
        s: '[AI] `tmux detach-client -s` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. It allows you to detach the current client (session) from the terminal without terminating it. The `-s` flag specifies the name or index of the session to detach. After running this command, the session runs in the background, and you can reattach to it later using `tmux attach-session -t <session_name|index>`. This is useful for keeping long-running processes or jobs alive while disconnecting from the terminal.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux detach-client -t` command is used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to detach the current client or session from the terminal without terminating it. When you run this command, the session remains active in the background and any ongoing processes or jobs continue to run. This allows you to reattach to the session later, preserving its state, by using the `tmux attach` command. It''s essential for managing long-running tasks in terminal environments, enabling efficient multitasking and improving overall productivity.'
