documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker system events` command displays real-time events happening in your Docker system, such as container creation, start, stop, and network events. It provides a continuous output, allowing you to monitor the Docker environment in real time using the `docker system` command with the `--events` flag.'
    flag:
        filter: '[AI] `docker system events --filter` is a command used in Docker to filter and display real-time events from the Docker daemon. The `--filter` option allows specifying filters to narrow down the events based on specific criteria such as type, actor, or resource. For example, you can use filters like `type=container` to show only container events, or `actor=library` to show events caused by pulling an image from a registry. This command helps in monitoring and troubleshooting Docker environments in real-time.'
        format: '[AI] `docker system events --format` is a command used in Docker to retrieve real-time events from the Docker daemon. The `--format` option allows customizing the output format of the command using Go templates. This can be useful for processing and analyzing the event data programmatically. For example, you might use it to extract specific information like container names or event types and feed that into other tools or scripts.'
        since: '[AI] `docker system events --since` is a command used in Docker to list events that occurred after a specified timestamp. The Docker Engine produces various events while managing containers, images, networks, and volumes. By using the `--since` flag followed by a date or Unix timestamp, you can filter and display only the events that have been recorded since the given point in time. This can be helpful for troubleshooting issues, monitoring system activities, or analyzing past events in your Docker environment.'
        until: '[AI] `docker system events --until` is a command used in Docker to list events that occurred in the Docker Swarm or Docker TinySwarm cluster up until a specified time. The `--until` option filters the output to display only events that occurred before the given timestamp. This can be useful for troubleshooting and monitoring Docker clusters, as it allows you to see what happened leading up to a particular issue or event. The output will include information such as the event type (e.g., node added, service updated), the time the event occurred, and any associated metadata.'
