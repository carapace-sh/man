    command: '[AI] `gh pr unlock` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to unlock a pull request for rebasing or squashing commits. This command is particularly helpful when working with GitHub''s protected branches and merge strategies, ensuring that only the latest version of a branch can be merged. By using `gh pr unlock`, you temporarily release the lock on a specific pull request, allowing you to make further changes before merging it back into the main branch.'
