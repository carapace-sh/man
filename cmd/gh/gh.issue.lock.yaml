    command: '[AI] The `gh issue lock` command is used with the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) to prevent further interactions on a specific GitHub Issue. It sets the issue lock to true, making it read-only for collaborators and assignees. This can be useful when an issue has been resolved and you want to prevent any accidental changes or comments that could disrupt the closure process.'
    flag:
        reason: '[AI] The `gh issue lock` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to prevent further comments or actions on an issue, except for those with write access to the repository. This command sets a reason for the lock, which can be specified using the `--reason` option. For instance, `gh issue lock <issue-number> --reason "Code review complete, ready for merge"`. The lock helps maintain focus and keeps the conversation organized around an issue during specific stages of development.'
