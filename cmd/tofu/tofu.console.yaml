documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "tofu console" is not a standard or widely used command in computing. It appears to be specific to Tofu, an open-source data flow programming language. The command likely launches a Tofu REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) interface also referred to as a console, providing interactive access to the Tofu environment for running and testing code snippets on the fly.'
    flag:
        state: '[AI] The `tofu console -state` command is specific to Tofu, a Kubernetes CLI tool. It is used to check the current state of resources managed by Tofu in a Kubernetes cluster. When run without any arguments, it displays a list of all the resources being managed by Tofu along with their status (running, paused, etc.). If followed by a specific resource name or kind, it will display the state of that particular resource.'
        var: '[AI] The `tofu console -var` command is used in Tofu, a security testing tool for Kubernetes, to display or modify the value of a specific variable or environment variable within a Kubernetes cluster. This command interacts with the Tofu CLI (Command Line Interface) and allows users to view or update variables for further exploration or manipulation during security testing.'
        var-file: '[AI] The `tofu console --var-file` command is used in Tofu, a Kubernetes secret and configuration management tool. This specific command is for loading variables from an external file instead of hardcoding them directly on the command line. The file path to the variable file should be provided as an argument to this flag. It''s useful when dealing with sensitive information or managing large numbers of configurations, making the process more secure and efficient.'
