documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint workspace` command in Waypoint (a multi-host application management tool by Google) is used to manage and switch between different working directories or projects on your local machine. This command allows you to set a specific local directory as the active workspace, which affects where Waypoint looks for configuration files and other project-related resources when executing commands or deployments. By using this command, you can easily manage multiple projects with distinct configurations in parallel.'
