flags:
    -h, --help: Print help (see more with '--help')
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "jj duplicate" command is not a standard command in Unix or Linux systems. It seems to be specific to the Vim text editor''s "Jump Forward" (jj) and "Duplicate Current Line" (d) commands combined into one, meaning it duplicates the current line just below it. However, there''s no such built-in command in Vim as "jj duplicate". If you intend to duplicate a line, use the "d" command followed by the "p" command instead: `dd` for multiple lines or `dp` for a single line.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] The command `jj duplicate --help` is related to Jiro, a popular tool used for managing and transforming JavaScript modules. The `--help` flag is an argument provided with this command that displays detailed information about how to use the `duplicate` sub-command of Jiro. In simpler terms, it provides help documentation on how to duplicate a module or file using Jiro''s `duplicate` function.'
