documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `expand` command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems is used to expand tabs, braces, and other characters in a file based on specified tab stops and brace expansions. It reads input line by line and expands each line before printing it. This can be useful for formatting code or text files with consistent indentation or for automating certain text processing tasks. For example, the command `expand --tabs=4 file.txt` would expand all tabs in `file.txt` to spaces, using a tab stop of 4 spaces.'
    flag:
        help: |-
            [AI] The `expand --help` command is a part of Unix and Linux text processing utilities. It is used to expand tabs and braces in a file or input stream based on the specified tab stop and brace expansion rules.

            When you run the command with the `--help` option, it will display detailed information about how to use the `expand` tool effectively. This includes:

            - Description of the utility and its purpose.
            - Explanation of various options, such as `-t` for setting the tab stop size or `-i` for preserving backslashes before special characters.
            - Examples on how to use the expand command with different options and input files.

            By providing the `--help` flag, you get a clear understanding of the functionalities and usage patterns of the `expand` utility, making it easier to apply it in your text processing tasks.
        initial: '[AI] The `expand --initial` command in Git is used to initialize an empty Git repository with a bare bones configuration. This means that only the necessary files for a Git repository, such as `HEAD`, `REFs`, and the `objects` directory, are created. It does not create a working directory or include any initial files. This is often used when creating a new Git server or when working with bare repositories.'
        tabs: '[AI] The `expand --tabs` command is a text editor or shell utility used to expand tabs in files into spaces, making the indention levels more visible and consistent. This can be useful for maintaining a coding style across a project or ensuring that files are easily readable by other developers. The number of spaces per tab is typically configurable and is often set to maintain a consistent code formatting style within a team or organization.'
        version: '[AI] The `expand --version` command is used with the `expand` utility in Unix-based systems. It displays the version number of the expand tool installed on the system, providing users with information about the specific version they are using. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and ensuring compatibility with other tools or configurations.'
