description: kill the server if it is running
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `adb kill-server` is a command used in Android Development to stop the Android Debug Bridge (adb) server from running. The adb server facilitates communication between a computer and an Android device for various tasks like installing apps, pushing files, or running shell commands. In some cases, the adb server may not shut down properly, leading to issues with new connections. Running `adb kill-server` terminates any existing adb server processes and allows you to start a new one if needed.'
