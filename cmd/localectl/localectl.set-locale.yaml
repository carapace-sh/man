        [AI] `localectl` is a system utility in Linux for managing localization and regional settings. The command `localectl set-locale` is used to configure the system locale, which determines the language and regional preferences for various components such as the keyboard layout, time format, and character encoding.

        The syntax of the command is: `sudo localectl set-locale [LANGUAGE] [KEYBOARD_LAYOUT]`. Here, `[LANGUAGE]` represents the desired language code (e.g., "en\_US" for English in the United States), and `[KEYBOARD_LAYOUT]` represents the corresponding keyboard layout (e.g., "us"). The use of `sudo` grants administrative privileges to execute the command system-wide.

        Upon successful execution, the system will be configured with the specified language and keyboard layout. This may affect various aspects of the user interface, including text input and date/time formatting.
