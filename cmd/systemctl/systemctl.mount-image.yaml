documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl mount-image` is a command used in Linux systems to automatically mount an image file as if it were a physical storage device. The `systemd` system and service manager executes this command, which takes the image file path as an argument and makes it available at a specified mount point in the filesystem. This allows access to the contents of the image file as if it were a physically attached device.'
