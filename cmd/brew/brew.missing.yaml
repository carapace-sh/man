        debug: '[AI] `brew missing --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is run when Homebrew can''t find a required formula or dependency for an installed package. The `--debug` flag enables detailed output to help diagnose and troubleshoot the issue.

        help: '[AI] `brew missing --help` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to display help information when the Homebrew installation is not found in the system''s PATH environment variable.

        hide: '[AI] The command `brew missing --hide` is a function provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command helps to manage outdated or missing dependencies in Homebrew installations.

This command searches for any Homebrew formulas that are not installed on your system but are required by dependencies of other installed packages.
