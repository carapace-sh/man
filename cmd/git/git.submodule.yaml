        [AI] `git submodule` is a Git feature used for managing referenced sub-projects within a main Git repository. Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another, and track the changes made to the subrepository over time. Common use cases include managing dependencies or shared codebases across multiple projects.

        Three primary commands are used with `git submodule`:

        1. `git submodule add [<Repository>] [<Path>]`: Adds a new submodule at the given path, by cloning the specified repository into it.
        2. `git submodule update [<Path>] [`--rebase` | --remote`]`: Updates the working copy of a submodule to the latest version in its remote repository or, when used with `--rebase`, merges any changes from the remote repository into the local one.
        3. `git submodule foreach [<Command>]`: Runs a command on each submodule, either locally or remotely, allowing you to apply updates consistently across multiple projects.
