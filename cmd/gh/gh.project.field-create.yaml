    command: '[AI] The `gh project field-create` command is used in GitHub CLI (github-cli) to create a new custom field for a specific project in GitHub. This command takes the following format: `gh project <project_id> field-create <FIELD_NAME>`. Here, `<project_id>` refers to the ID or slug of the target project and `<FIELD_NAME>` is the name you want to give to the new custom field. This command adds a custom field definition to the project''s settings, enabling users to add values for that field when they create or update issues, pull requests, or projects within that specific project.'
    flag:
        data-type: '[AI] The `gh project field-create` is a command used in the GitHub CLI (git-hub) to create a new custom field in a GitHub Project. The `--data-type` option specifies the type of data that will be stored in the field. It can be one of three types: text, number, or checkbox. For example, `gh project field-create --project 123 --key myfield --title "My Field" --data-type text` would create a new custom text field named "My Field" in the project with ID 123.'
        format: '[AI] The `gh` command you provided is specific to GitHub''s official CLI tool. The `project field-create` subcommand creates a new project field in a GitHub Project. The `--format` option specifies the desired output format when creating the field. This allows users to customize how the newly created field will appear in their projects, for instance, by defining custom labels or emoji for the field. For example, `gh project field-create --new-field myField --type text --label My Label --emoji :myEmoji:`.'
        jq: '[AI] `gh` is a command-line tool for interacting with GitHub. The command `gh project field-create` creates a new custom field in a GitHub Project. The `--jq` flag passes the output of the previous `gh` command to the JavaScript object querying language (JQ) for further processing and manipulation of JSON data before displaying it in the terminal.'
        name: '[AI] `gh project field-create` is a command used in GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, named `gh`, to create a new custom field in a specific GitHub Project. The `--name` flag is used to specify the desired name for this new custom field. When you run `gh project field-create --name <NAME>`, it creates a new custom field with the given name in your GitHub Project.'
        owner: '[AI] The `gh project field-create` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new custom field in a GitHub Project. The `--owner` option specifies the owner of the project, which is required to identify the specific project to modify. This command allows users to define custom fields to track additional information within their projects, enhancing project management capabilities.'
        single-select-options: '[AI] `gh project field-create` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new custom field in a GitHub Project. The `--single-select-options` flag is an option that can be passed with this command to configure the newly created field as having only single select options. This means that when creating or editing an issue or pull request associated with the project, users will only be able to select one option from a predefined list for the custom field, instead of being able to input multiple choices or free text.'
        template: '[AI] The `gh project field-create --template` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new custom field in a GitHub Project. The `--template` option specifies the schema definition for the new custom field, defining its key-value pair properties and other metadata. This command assists project administrators in managing their projects by allowing them to define and enforce specific data structures using custom fields.'
