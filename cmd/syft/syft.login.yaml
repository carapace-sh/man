documentation:
    command: '[AI] `syft login` is a command used in Syft, an open-source SSH key manager, for adding new machines to the Syft database. When you run this command in your terminal, it opens a web interface where you can enter the machine''s IP address or hostname and provide its SSH credentials (username and private key). After successful authentication, Syft adds the machine to its encrypted database and generates an alias for easy identification. This simplifies the process of managing and connecting to remote machines securely, eliminating the need to handle sensitive keys directly.'
    flag:
        password: '[AI] The `syft login` command is a part of Syft, an open-source SSH agent that enables secure file transfers between different cloud environments. The `--password` option is used to authenticate with a password instead of using an SSH key for authentication. This can be useful when accessing a new environment where you don''t have an existing SSH key set up or when you want to provide temporary access to someone else. When using the `--password` option, Syft will prompt you to enter the password for the specified account during the login process.'
        password-stdin: |-
            [AI] `syft login --password-stdin` is a command used in Syft, an open-source SSH agent that allows secure transfer of data between multiple machines without the need for storing passwords or keys in plaintext.

            This specific command is used to log into a remote machine using Syft and providing the password via standard input (stdin), instead of entering it manually at the command line. It is particularly useful when automating scripts that require SSH access, as it avoids having to hardcode passwords in the script or store them in plaintext files.
        username: '[AI] The `syft login` command is used in Syft, a secure file transfer tool, to initiate a new connection with a remote machine. The `--username` option is used to specify the username or account name for authentication during the SSH connection. This is required to successfully log into and establish a secure session with the remote system.'
