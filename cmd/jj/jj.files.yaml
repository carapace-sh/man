    command: '[AI] The command "jj files" is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It seems to be specific to the Javython (Java + Python) programming environment. This command is used for navigating through a list of recently opened files in the Javython IDE, similar to the "cd" command in Linux for changing directories.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] The `jj` is a popular text editor for JavaScript and JSON files, developed by Sarah Chambless. The `--help` flag is an option provided with this tool that, when used with the command, displays comprehensive information about the available features and usage of the `jj` editor. This flag helps users understand how to effectively use the editor by presenting them with details such as installation instructions, keyboard shortcuts, commands, and other advanced options.'
        revision: '[AI] The `--revision` option in the `git jj` (Jupyter Journal) command is used to checkout a specific revision or commit of a Jupyter Notebook project stored in a Git repository. The option takes the SHA-1 hash, branch name, or tag as an argument and checks out the corresponding version of the notebook files. This can be useful when working on collaborative projects or when you want to revert to a previous state of your project.'
