            [AI] `newrelic decode url` is a command-line tool provided by New Relic to decode and parse URLs for better visibility into application performance. The `--param` option is used to extract specific query parameters from the URL.

            For instance, if you have a URL with multiple query strings like `www.example.com/path?param1=value1&param2=value2`, you can use `newrelic decode url --param param1 www.example.com/path` to extract and display only the value of `param1`. This helps in deep analysis of incoming traffic and troubleshooting issues more effectively.
        search: '[AI] `newrelic decode url` is a command-line tool provided by New Relic to decode and extract meaningful information from URLs, particularly those used in web requests. The `--search` option is used to search for specific regular expression patterns within the decoded URL data. For instance, `newrelic decode url --search="param=([\w\-]+)"` can be used to extract a parameter value with the name "param" from the URL.'
