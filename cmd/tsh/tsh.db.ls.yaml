documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tsh db ls` command is used in Tenable''s SecurityCenter Continuous View (CV) platform to list all databases configured within the system. It provides a summary of each database, including its name, type, and current size. This command can be helpful for identifying and managing multiple databases associated with your SecurityCenter installation.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] The command `tsh db ls --all` is a query in the Tshoot database tool for MySQL or MariaDB. It is used to list all databases present in the current instance or server. The `--all` flag indicates that the command should show both user-created and system databases in the output.'
        format: |-
            [AI] `tsh` is likely referring to the TSH (Tarball Shell), a Unix-like shell developed for the Tor Project. The command `tsh db ls --format` is used to list the contents of a Tor database directory with custom output formatting.

            Here's a breakdown:

            1. `tsh`: Invokes the TSH shell.
            2. `db`: Refers to the Tor project's data directories, which may include files like torrc, keys, and various databases (e.g., consensus, authority).
            3. `ls`: The Unix command to list the contents of a directory or a file with its attributes (such as permissions, size, timestamp, etc.).
            4. `--format`: A flag that specifies how the output should be formatted. It can take various values such as long, short, all, or custom formats defined by the user. By providing custom formatting strings, users can tailor the output to their specific requirements.
        no-all: '[AI] `tsh` is likely a reference to the Tenable Security Hardening Tool, which is a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool used for managing Tenable security products like Nessus and OpenVAS. The command `tsh db ls --no-all` lists the databases in the Tenable Vulnerability Management system but excludes the "all" database, which typically refers to a consolidated view of all other databases. This command is used when an administrator wants to specifically list and manage individual databases rather than the overall aggregated view.'
        no-verbose: '[AI] The command `tsh` is likely a reference to Taylor Shell or TSH, a Unix-based shell, and `db` could be an alias for a specific database management system. The given command `tsh db ls --no-verbose` translates to "list all databases under the current directory in the `db` system, but do not display verbose output." In other words, it lists the names of the databases without extra information or details.'
        query: |-
            [AI] `tsh` is a command-line tool for interacting with the Tesla Model S and X cars' web interface through an SSH connection. The command `tsh db ls --query` lists the available keys in the Tesla database with the given query.

            Here's a brief explanation of each part:

            1. `tsh`: Tesla Security Hub command-line tool
            2. `db`: Short for "database"
            3. `ls`: List contents of a directory
            4. `--query`: Specify a query to filter the result

            So, `tsh db ls --query` will display a list of keys in the Tesla database that match the given query. This can be used to check and manage various settings, configurations, and other data stored in the car's system.
        search: |-
            [AI] The command `tsh db ls --search` is a command used in the TSH (Telstra Site Harmony) tool, which is utilized for managing and monitoring Telstra's communications network infrastructure. In this specific command:

            1. `tsh`: Invokes the TSH CLI (Command Line Interface).
            2. `db`: Specifies that you want to work with the TSH database.
            3. `ls`: Displays a list of database records.
            4. `--search`: Filters the output by performing a search based on specified criteria, such as record names or other attributes.
        verbose: |-
            [AI] `tsh` is likely a reference to the Tiger Shaw Terminal (TSH) shell, which is a Unix-based terminal emulator for SAS Institute's Jmp Statistical Discovery software. The given command, `tsh db ls --verbose`, is used to list the databases in your JMP project with detailed information.

            The command breakdown:

            1. `tsh`: Invokes the Tiger Shaw Terminal shell.
            2. `db`: Refers to the databasemenu, which manages the JMP projects and their associated databases.
            3. `ls`: Lists the contents of a directory or in this case, the databases within the current project.
            4. `--verbose`: Provides more detailed output for each database listed.
