documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant package` command is used to create a portable, self-contained box file in Vagrant. It packages up a running Vagrant environment, including the operating system, applications, and configurations, into a single file (with the extension `.box`) that can be easily shared with others or moved between different systems without the need for an internet connection or access to the original source files. This command is typically used when you want to distribute your configured environment as a reusable Vagrant box.'
    flag:
        base: '[AI] The `vagrant package --base` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments, to create or update a custom base box. A base box is a pre-prepared virtual machine image that can be used as the foundation for other Vagrant configurations. This command specifies the base box name and optionally, a new box version number, which will be created or updated in the local Vagrantbox directory. The resulting custom box can then be used with various Vagrant projects, allowing for consistent environments across development teams or projects.'
        include: '[AI] `vagrant package --include` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command is used to specify one or more boxes (pre-packaged virtual machines) that should be included when creating a Vagrant package. The resulting package will only contain the specified boxes and their associated configurations and files, reducing the size of the package and making it quicker to transfer or share with others.'
        info: '[AI] `vagrant package --info` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command displays detailed information about any packaged Vagrant boxes that are currently installed on your system. It lists each box with its name, version, builder, and other relevant details, allowing you to easily check which versions of specific boxes are installed.'
        output: '[AI] `vagrant package --output` is a Vagrant command used to build and package a Vagrant environment into a single distributive file (box file). The `--output` option specifies the name and location of the output file. It creates a shareable box that can be easily imported into other Vagrant projects or distributed to other users.'
        vagrantfile: '[AI] The `vagrant package` command is a Vagrant utility that builds and packages a Vagrant environment as a portable, self-contained box file. This can be useful for distributing the environment to other users or environments. The `--vagrantfile` option specifies the path to the Vagrantfile describing the environment to be packaged. After running this command, the resulting box file can be uploaded and used with `vagrant box add`.'
