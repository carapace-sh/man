documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pulumi destroy` is a command used in Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform, to delete all resources managed by Pulumi in a stack. It does not delete any manual or unmanaged resources. Running this command will prompt you for confirmation before executing the destruction. Once confirmed, Pulumi will remove the associated AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or other cloud provider''s resources based on your current configuration. This is useful when you want to dispose of a previously deployed infrastructure, like in testing environments or when making significant changes to your infrastructure design.'
    flag:
        json: '[AI] `pulumi destroy --json` is a command used in Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform, to delete previously deployed resources and their associated state. The `--json` option returns the output in JSON format for further processing or analysis. This command removes the specified stack and returns a JSON response containing metadata about the destroyed resources, such as resource names, types, and IDs.'
