documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `wezterm ls-fonts` command is used within a WezTerm terminal emulator session to list all installed fonts that are available for use in WezTerm. It does not interact with the operating system''s file system but instead displays a JSON-formatted output showing the family names and other metadata of each font.'
    flag:
        codepoints: '[AI] `wezterm ls-fonts --codepoints` is a command used in the Wezterm terminal emulator to list the Unicode code points supported by installed fonts. It helps users identify and manage fonts that include specific glyphs or characters needed for their work. This command does not directly display flags, but rather lists the code points, which are unique identifiers for each character in a Unicode standard.'
        help: '[AI] `wezterm ls-fonts --help` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for Unix and Windows, to display a list of installed fonts along with relevant information such as family name, style names, and unicode ranges. The `--help` option provides brief usage instructions for this specific subcommand.'
        list-system: '[AI] The `wezterm ls-fonts --list-system` command is a tool specific to the Wezterm terminal emulator for listing system-installed fonts. It outputs a formatted list of font families and their corresponding style mappings that Wezterm can use for rendering text in the terminal. The `--list-system` flag instructs Wezterm to include only the system-installed fonts in the output, as opposed to user-defined or custom fonts.'
        rasterize-ascii: '[AI] The command `wezterm ls-fonts --rasterize-ascii` is used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for Unix and Windows. This command lists all installed fonts in WezTerm and generates rasterized previews of their Ascii characters. Rasterization converts vector graphics into bitmap images, allowing the displayed characters to have a consistent appearance across different systems and resolutions. This can be helpful when selecting or comparing fonts for use in the terminal.'
        text: '[AI] `wezterm ls-fonts --text` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for Unix and Windows. This command lists all installed fonts in the WezTerm configuration with text output format. It helps users manage and select fonts for their terminal preferences.'
