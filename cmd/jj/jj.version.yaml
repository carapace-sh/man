            [AI] The `--help` option when used with the `jj version` command in Jira is intended to display detailed help information about that specific command. It provides a clear explanation of what the command does, how it should be used, and any available options or arguments.

            For instance, running `jj version --help` might output something like:

            ```bash
            Usage: jj version [OPTIONS]

            This command displays the current installed version of Jira CLI (JJ) and the Jira server connection it is connected to.

            Options:
              --verbose          Be more verbose, print out detailed information about versions, connections etc.
              -h, --help         Show this message and exit.
            ```

            In summary, using `--help` with `jj version` will display the command's usage details, options, and any additional information needed to effectively utilize it.
