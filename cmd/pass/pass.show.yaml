documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pass show` command in OpenBSD''s Password Hash Database is used to display detailed information about a stored password hash entry. When given a username, it will print out the corresponding password hash along with any associated data, such as the date and time of the last password change or the minimum/maximum number of failed login attempts before locking the account. This command helps in debugging and maintaining password policies within the Password File System.'
    flag:
        clip: '[AI] The `pass show --clip` command is a part of OpenSSH''s `pass` utility, which is used to manage keychain files. This specific command is used to display the contents of a GPG-encrypted clipboard in the keychain. It does not directly interact with flags, but rather is a subcommand under the `show` command. The clipboard refers to recently copied data that can be pasted elsewhere, and the use of this command allows you to access and view the encryption status and contents of those clipboard items.'
