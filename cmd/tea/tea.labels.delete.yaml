documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea labels delete` command is used in Apache Hadoop''s Hive Data Warehouse (Tezoobquaso''s Extension for Advanced Analysis) to remove specific labels from existing Hive tables or partitions. When executed, it deletes the specified labels without affecting the underlying data. The usage would be something like: `tea labels delete <table_name> [<partition_spec>] ...` where `<table_name>` is the name of the table and optional `<partition_spec>` specifies the partition to modify. Multiple tables or partitions can be deleted by listing them separately.'
    flag:
        id: '[AI] The command `tea labels delete --id <ID>` is used in the Teasql CLI (Command Line Interface) of the Teaspoon tea management system to delete a specific label with the given ID from the tea database. This command does not affect any teas or other labels, it only deletes the label identified by the provided ID.'
        login: |-
            [AI] The command `tea labels delete --login` is used in the Teapasoi UI CLI (User Interface Command Line Interface) of Tectonic, an open-source Kubernetes platform for enterprise applications. This command deletes labels with the key `--login` from objects in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Tectonic.

            The `tea labels delete` subcommand is used to manage labels. The `--login` flag filters the selection of labels to delete. By using this command, you can remove labels that are no longer needed or have been mistakenly applied, helping to keep your Kubernetes resources organized and correctly labeled.
        output: |-
            [AI] The `tea labels delete` command in Kubernetes is used to remove one or more labels from select Kubernetes objects, such as pods or services. The `--output` flag specifies the format for the output of the operation.

            Here are some options for the `--output` flag:

            * `json`: Outputs the deletion results in JSON format.
            * `yaml`: Outputs the deletion results in YAML format.
            * `none`: Suppresses the output of the command.

            For example, if you want to delete the label "app=my-app" from all pods in a namespace with the name "my-namespace", and you want the output in JSON format, you would use the following command:
            ```
            kubectl label pods --all-namespaces app=my-app -n my-namespace --hide-removed=true -o json | tee labels.json | kubectl delete -f -
            tea labels delete --selector app=my-app -n my-namespace --output json
            ```
            In this example, the `tee` command is used to write the output of the first `kubectl` command to a file named "labels.json". The second `kubectl` command deletes the labels using the output from the first command.
        remote: '[AI] The `git` command `tea labels delete --remote` is used to remove remote branch labels in a Git repository. The `--remote` option specifies that the operation should be performed on the remote branches instead of local ones. This command can be useful when you want to clean up old or unnecessary branch labels on a remote Git server. It does not affect the commits or history, only the labels associated with those branches.'
        repo: '[AI] The `tea labels delete --repo` command is used to delete all labels in a specified Git repository managed by the Tectonic (TEA) toolset. This operation removes any metadata tags associated with commits within that repository, modifying its history. Use this command cautiously as deleting labels may impact workflows or collaboration among team members.'
