    command: '[AI] `terraform show` is a Terraform command used to display the current state of your infrastructure as defined in your configuration files, without making any changes to the actual infrastructure.

        json: '[AI] `terraform show -json` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Terraform infrastructure as code tool. This command displays the current representation of an infrastructure configuration as JSON format based on the defined Terraform configuration files and the provider''s data source schema. It does not make any changes to your infrastructure; it simply shows you a detailed representation of the resources, their properties, and interrelationships that would be created or updated. This output can be useful for validating configurations, understanding resource hierarchies, and generating input for other scripts or tools.'
        no-color: '[AI] `terraform show -no-color` is a command used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool.

It shows resource instances and their properties in a plain text format.'
