documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dockerd` is the Docker daemon, which is a background process that manages container runtime operations. It pulls Docker images from registries, creates and starts containers, and handles communication between containers and the host system. When you run `dockerd`, it initializes the Docker environment and begins listening for Docker API requests, allowing you to manage containers using tools like `docker run` or the Docker CLI.'
    flag:
        add-runtime: '[AI] `dockerd --add-runtime` is a command-line option used with Docker''s daemon (dockerd). This option allows you to register custom runtime engines, which are alternative implementations of the container runtime other than Docker''s built-in engine. By adding a new runtime, you can use it to run containers in your Docker environment. The option takes the path to the directory containing the runtime''s binary files as an argument.'
        allow-nondistributable-artifacts: '[AI] The `--allow-nondistributable-artifacts` flag is used when running Docker as a daemon (dockerd). It permits the usage of artifacts that are not distributed through a registry, allowing the use of local builds or custom images that may contain non-standard components. This flag expands the trust boundary beyond official registries and increases potential security risks, making it important to only use trusted sources when enabling this feature.'
        api-cors-header: |-
            [AI] The `--api-cors-header` flag in Docker is used to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers for the Docker API. CORS is a security measure that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than which served the original web page.

            By setting this flag, Docker can include specific allowed origins, methods, and headers in the response headers of its API calls, enabling cross-domain access to Docker resources under controlled conditions. This can be useful for remote management of Docker hosts or integration with cloud services that follow CORS policies.
        authorization-plugin: '[AI] The `--authorization-plugin` flag in Docker is used to specify an authentication plugin for Docker''s Swarm mode. When Swarm mode is enabled, this flag allows you to configure additional security layers, such as implementing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) or TLS (Transport Layer Security), by specifying the path to a custom plugin. The plugin communicates with the Swarm manager and worker nodes to control access to various Docker resources based on defined policies.'
        bip: '[AI] `--bridge` is a networking option in Docker, which creates a software-defined bridge network. When you run `dockerd` with the `--bridge` flag, it sets up a default bridge network interface on the host machine. Containers started without an explicit network configuration are connected to this bridge network by default. This allows them to communicate with each other as well as with the outside world via the host''s IP address.'
        bridge: '[AI] The `dockerd --bridge` flag is used to enable Docker''s built-in network bridge driver when running a container. This driver creates a virtual bridge network interface on the Docker host and connects it to the container''s virtual Ethernet adapter, allowing containers to communicate with each other using their unique IP addresses within the same Docker network. The bridge also allows containers to access the internet through the Docker daemon if an external network is connected.'
        cgroup-parent: '[AI] The `dockerd --cgroup-parent` flag is used to specify the CGroup parent for Docker''s container runtime when running as a system service. It allows you to set the container runtime''s hierarchical control group (cgroups) structure, controlling the allocation of system resources such as CPU and memory among containers and other system processes. By setting the `--cgroup-parent` flag, you can ensure that Docker containers are managed under a specific cgroups hierarchy for resource isolation and optimization.'
        config-file: '[AI] `dockerd --config-file` is an option used with Docker''s daemon (dockerd), which specifies a custom configuration file to be used instead of the default one located at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. The configuration file can include various settings for Docker, such as network modes, storage options, and security policies. This option allows users to customize their Docker environment to suit specific use cases.'
        containerd: '[AI] The `dockerd --containerd` flag is used to start Docker with the Containerd runtime as its backend. Containerd is an open-source container runtime developed by Docker, which provides an alternative way to manage containers compared to the traditional Docker engine. By using this flag, Docker will rely on Containerd for creating and managing containers, providing improved performance, better integration with other orchestration tools like Kubernetes, and enhanced security features.'
        containerd-namespace: |-
            [AI] The `--containerd-namespace` flag is a command-line option for Docker's container runtime, `dockerd`. This flag sets the Container Network Interface (CNI) networking namespace used by Containerd, the underlying container runtime engine.

            By default, Containerd uses the host's network namespace, but setting this flag allows you to run it in an isolated network namespace. Isolating Containerd in its own namespace provides improved security and isolation benefits as it prevents containers from directly accessing the host's network stack.

            It is essential to note that when using this flag, you should also ensure proper network plugin setup (like CNI plugins) to allow communication between the containers and the outside world.
        containerd-plugins-namespace: '[AI] The `--containerd-plugins-namespace` flag is a command-line option for Docker''s container runtime, `dockerd`. It sets the namespace used by Containerd plugins. Namespaces provide a way to isolate different components of a system, in this case, the Containerd plugins, from each other and the main Docker daemon process. By default, Containerd uses the same namespace as the Docker daemon. However, setting `--containerd-plugins-namespace` allows you to run Containerd plugins in a separate namespace for improved security or organizational purposes.'
        cpu-rt-period: '[AI] The `--cpu-rt-period` flag is a command-line option for Docker''s container runtime, `dockerd`. This option sets the CPU real-time (RT) period for containers, which is the maximum amount of time in nanoseconds that a container is guaranteed to have uninterrupted access to the CPU for handling hard real-time tasks. By default, Docker does not impose any RT priority or period on containers, and they run with best-effort scheduling. However, when this flag is set, containers will be scheduled with the specified RT priority and period, which helps ensure that critical tasks running in containers are executed within their required time constraints.'
        cpu-rt-runtime: '[AI] The `--cpu-rt-runtime` flag in Docker is used to specify a specific Real-Time (RT) Linux kernel thread scheduling policy for containers. This policy prioritizes real-time tasks over non-real-time tasks, ensuring low latency and deterministic performance for applications that require it. By default, Docker containers run with the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), which does not support real-time scheduling. With `--cpu-rt-runtime`, you can assign a container to an RT kernel thread, which ensures its CPU resources are allocated in a predictable manner.'
        cri-containerd: '[AI] The `dockerd --cri-containerd` flag is used to configure Docker to use Containerd as its Container Runtime Interface (CRI). Containerd is an alternative container runtime to Docker''s built-in engine. By using this flag, Docker will communicate with Containerd instead of managing containers directly. This setup can provide improved performance, security, and flexibility in managing containers in a Kubernetes environment or other orchestration systems.'
        data-root: '[AI] The `--data-root` flag in Docker is used to specify a custom directory for storing data, including container data volumes, network and plugin data, as well as Swarm mode data if Docker is running in that mode. This can be useful when you want to separate the default Docker data directories from the main file system or when running Docker in a read-only file system environment.'
        debug: '[AI] `dockerd --debug` is a command used to start the Docker daemon with debug mode enabled. This mode provides more detailed output and logs, which can be helpful for diagnosing issues or gaining deeper insights into Docker''s behavior. It can be useful when encountering errors or performance problems, as it can provide additional information about what the Docker daemon is doing in real-time. However, enabling debug mode may result in more extensive log output and potentially slower performance, so it should be used judiciously.'
        default-address-pool: '[AI] The `--default-address-pool` flag in Docker is used to configure the IP address range from which Docker will assign container networks. By default, Docker uses the `172.17.0.0/16` private address space for container networking. When this flag is set, a different CIDR block can be specified instead. This allows for customization of network addressing in various use cases like multi-host Docker environments or when working with multiple networks.'
        default-cgroupns-mode: |-
            [AI] The `--default-cgroupns-mode` flag in Docker refers to the Cgroup namespace mode used for container isolation. Cgroups (Control Groups) are a Linux kernel feature that allows resource limitation and prioritization of processes or containers.

            When using `--default-cgroupns-mode`, you can choose between three modes: "bridge", "host" or "none".

            1. Bridge: Docker creates a new Cgroup hierarchy for the container, with a bridge as the root, and attaches it to the default network created by Docker. This mode provides both process and resource isolation.

            2. Host: The container shares the same cgroup hierarchy with the host system. This mode does not provide any resource or process isolation but is useful for development purposes where you want to test how your application behaves without the overhead of Docker's containerization.

            3. None: No Cgroup namespace is created. In this case, you need to manage cgroups yourself using an external Cgroup manager like systemd or cAdvisor. This mode offers the most control but also requires more expertise and management overhead.
        default-gateway: |-
            [AI] The `--default-gateway` flag is an option for Docker's `dockerd` daemon, which is used to configure its network settings. Specifically, this flag sets the IP address of the default gateway for containers created on that Docker host.

            When a container is started without explicitly specifying a network, it is assigned to the default bridge network managed by Docker. By default, this network has a virtual IP address assigned from the private address space `172.x.0.0/16`, and its gateway is automatically set to the IP address of the host's default gateway.

            Setting the `--default-gateway` flag allows you to override this behavior by explicitly specifying a different default gateway for your containers. This can be useful when working with specific network configurations, such as in environments where the Docker host is behind a NAT or when using custom network plugins.
        default-gateway-v6: '[AI] `dockerd --default-gateway-v6` is a command line argument used with Docker''s daemon (the background process managing containers). It sets the default gateway for IPv6 addresses assigned to containers created on that host. This means that when a container requires an IPv6 address, it will automatically get one from this gateway, enabling connectivity to IPv6 networks without further configuration.'
        default-ipc-mode: |-
            [AI] The `--default-ipc-mode` flag in Docker sets the default IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mode for newly created containers. IPC allows containers to communicate with each other and the host system using various mechanisms, such as named pipes, shared memory, or message queues.

            By default, Docker uses the `bridge` IPC mode, which creates a virtual bridge network interface on the host and connects each container to it. However, there are other IPC modes like `host`, `shareMem`, and `namedPipe` that may be desirable in specific use cases.

            Setting the `--default-ipc-mode` flag allows you to set a particular IPC mode as the default for all new containers created with that Docker daemon, without having to specify it each time you create a container using the `docker run` command.
        default-runtime: '[AI] The `dockerd --default-runtime` flag in Docker sets the default runtime for Docker Engine to use when building, running, or creating containers. A container runtime is the engine that actually runs containers, and Docker supports multiple runtimes like Docker''s own runtime (containerd) and others like CRI-O or shieds.io/docker-desktop-runtime. By setting `--default-runtime`, you specify which runtime should be used unless explicitly overridden in other ways. This can affect the features, performance, or compatibility of your containers.'
        default-shm-size: '[AI] `dockerd --default-shm-size` is a command-line option for Docker''s daemon (the background service that manages containers). The option sets the default size of the Shared Memory (SHM) segment used by containers. SHM is an area in the system''s memory that can be shared between containers and the host machine, allowing for more efficient data transfer and larger container sizes. The flag allows you to set a custom default size (in bytes), which will be used unless otherwise specified in a per-container context.'
        default-ulimit: '[AI] The `dockerd --default-ulimit` flag is used when running the Docker daemon to set default resource limits for containers. Specifically, it sets the maximum number of open files and the maximum memory and CPU usage for all containers. This flag can help prevent containers from consuming excessive resources, improving overall system performance and stability. The values can be specified in various formats, such as absolute numbers or percentages of total system resources. For example, `--default-ulimit mem=2g,cpu=1.5` sets a default memory limit of 2 gigabytes and CPU limit of 1.5 cores for all containers.'
        dns: '[AI] `dockerd --dns` is a command-line option for Docker''s container runtime, Docker Daemon (dockerd). It sets the DNS server(s) used by the containers running in that environment. Containers normally inherit the network settings of their host system, but you can override this behavior using options like `--dns` to specify alternative DNS servers. This can be useful in scenarios where the default DNS servers do not provide the required name resolution for your applications, or when working with custom DNS setups.'
        dns-opt: '[AI] `dockerd --dns-opt` is a command-line option used with Docker''s daemon (dockerd). It allows configuring custom DNS options for the containers and services run in the Docker environment. By appending `--dns-opt OPTION=VALUE`, you can specify various DNS options such as `option=8.8.8.8:53` to use Google''s public DNS server for resolving container domain names, or set up a private DNS server using other options like `option=/etc/resolv.conf:53`. This option enhances the flexibility and security of your Docker network by customizing the DNS behavior according to your requirements.'
        dns-search: '[AI] The `--dns-search` flag in Docker is used to configure custom domain name searches for Docker''s built-in DNS server (also known as Docker''s network bridge). When a container is started and connected to this network, any unresolved hostnames will be searched against the specified domains before default search domains. This can be useful when working with multi-container applications or custom networks where you may want to avoid using common domain names or IP addresses for service discovery.'
        exec-opt: '[AI] `dockerd --exec-opt` is a command-line option for Docker''s daemon (dockerd). It modifies the options passed to the container''s `docker exec` command when running an ad-hoc command in a container. The flag follows the format `--exec-opt <key>=<value>`, where `<key>` is the name of the option and `<value>` is its value. For example, `--exec-opt " detach=false"` sets the `detach` option to `false`, meaning that the container will not run in detached mode when executing a command. Other common options include setting environment variables or working directories for the command.'
        exec-root: '[AI] The `--exec-root` flag in Docker is used to specify the base directory for commands run inside a container using `docker exec`. This flag allows you to set a custom root directory other than the container''s default root (`/`) when executing commands. For example, if you have a container with a specific application installed at `/app`, and you want to execute commands related to that application, you can use the `--exec-root /app` flag when running `docker exec` to ensure that the commands start from within that directory. This can help maintain a consistent working environment and reduce the need for manually navigating to specific directories when executing commands within containers.'
        experimental: '[AI] The `--experimental` flag for Docker is used to enable new features that are not yet stable or fully tested. It allows users to try out experimental functionalities in Docker, which may have potential risks and issues. When using this flag, Docker will display a warning message urging caution and reminding the user that they might encounter bugs and instability. Ultimately, it provides an opportunity for early adoption of new features and for users to provide valuable feedback to help improve the stability and usability of Docker over time.'
        fixed-cidr: '[AI] The `--fixed-cidr` flag in Docker is used to assign a specific IP address CIDR block (Continent-Independent Routing) to the Docker network interface. This means that Docker containers will be allocated IP addresses from this predefined pool, rather than using Docker''s default dynamic IP address allocation. The format for specifying a CIDR block is `<start_address>.<netmask>`, where `<start_address>` is the first IP address in the subnet and `<netmask>` defines the subnet size. For example, `192.168.0.0/16` would allocate addresses from `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`. This can be useful in network environments where fixed addressing is required for security or organizational reasons.'
        fixed-cidr-v6: '[AI] The `--fixed-cidr-v6` flag for Docker is used to configure the IP address management mode for Docker''s overlay networking in IPv6 environments. With this option, a specific IPv6 CIDR block is assigned as the subnet for the overlay network, ensuring fixed and deterministic IP addresses for containers in that network. This can be beneficial for certain use cases requiring predictable network configurations or integration with external IPv6 networks.'
        group: '[AI] `dockerd --group` is a command-line option for Docker''s daemon (dockerd). It sets the SELinux label of the Docker group, which is used to manage container security policies. When this option is used, all processes running in containers are assigned the specified label, allowing fine-grained access control based on labels using Security Contexts in Kubernetes or other systems that support SELinux labels for Docker containers.'
        help: '[AI] `dockerd --help` is a command used to display help information about Docker daemon, which is a background service that manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. The help flag (--help) is used to show detailed usage information for the Docker daemon command. It provides an overview of all available commands, their usage, and options. This can be useful for understanding how to use Docker effectively and troubleshooting common issues.'
        host: '[AI] The `--host` flag in Docker is used to configure the network settings for Docker when running a container. Specifically, it sets the networking mode of the container to "host" networking, which means that the container shares the same network stack and ports as the Docker host itself. This can be useful in certain scenarios, such as when you want to run a container that needs to listen on a specific port or access a service running directly on the host. However, it''s important to note that using host networking mode can pose security risks if not used carefully, as containers sharing the same network stack and ports as the Docker host can potentially interfere with or be accessed by other containers or applications.'
        host-gateway-ip: '[AI] The `--host-gateway` flag in Docker is used to specify the IP address that will be used as the gateway for the default network created by Docker when no custom network is defined. With the `--host-gateway-ip` option, you can set this IP address explicitly. When Docker runs containers and they need to communicate with the outside world or with other containers in the same network, they use the host gateway IP as their default gateway. This allows for easier communication between containers and the outside world without the need to manually configure each container''s network settings.'
        icc: '[AI] The `--icc` flag for Docker is short for "Container-to-Container Communication." It enables network communication between containers running on the same Docker host without requiring an explicit network connection between them. This flag improves application interoperability and simplifies service discovery within a multi-container environment. When used, Docker creates a default overlay network with this communication feature enabled for all containers launched without specifying a custom network.'
        init: '[AI] The `dockerd --init` command is used to initialize a new Docker Swarm mode cluster. When run on a manager node, it creates an empty key-value store for Swarm mode and initializes the Swarm context with a default overlay network. This sets up the Docker Swarm environment, allowing other worker nodes to join the cluster and begin scheduling containers.'
        init-path: '[AI] `dockerd --init-path` is a command-line option for Docker''s daemon (dockerd) that specifies the path where the initial Docker network and volume plugins are located. When Docker starts, it loads these plugins to manage networking and data storage for containers. By setting the `--init-path` flag, you can customize the location of these plugins, which might be necessary in certain environments or when using third-party plugins.'
        insecure-registry: '[AI] The `--insecure-registry` flag in Docker is used to register an image registry as insecure, allowing Docker to pull images from that registry without checking its SSL certificate. This can be useful when working with private registries that don''t have valid certificates or when using self-hosted registries that aren''t publicly accessible over HTTPS. However, it''s important to note that ignoring SSL certificate checks comes with security risks, as an attacker could potentially intercept and modify the image traffic. Therefore, this option should be used with caution and only in trusted environments.'
        ip: '[AI] The `--ip` flag in Docker is used to specify the IP address under which the Docker daemon (dockerd) should listen for connections. This can be useful in certain network environments where the default Docker IP address might not be accessible or desirable. Setting this flag allows the Docker host to communicate with Docker containers or Swarm services using the specified IP address instead of the default one.'
        ip-forward: '[AI] The `--ip-forward` flag in Docker is used to enable IP forwarding on a Docker daemon. This allows containers to use custom IP addresses and ports, making them accessible from outside the host machine. With IP forwarding enabled, traffic can be routed between the container''s network interface and the host''s network interface, allowing external access to services running in the container. It is commonly used when setting up a Docker application for public access.'
        ip-masq: '[AI] The `--ip-masq` flag is a command-line option for Docker, the container runtime platform. This option enables IP address masquerading in the Docker network setup. In simple terms, it allows containers to access the external network using the Docker daemon''s IP address as their outgoing source address. This can be useful when you want to use custom or private networks with Docker where assigning unique IP addresses to each container is not practical. Instead, all containers on a given network share the Docker daemon''s IP as their apparent source address.'
        ip6tables: '[AI] `dockerd --ip6tables` is a command-line option used when running the Docker daemon (dockerd). This option enables IPv6 firewall rules for the Docker daemon to filter network traffic. It improves the security of the Docker host by controlling incoming and outgoing network connections at the IPv6 level. When enabled, Docker creates iptables rules automatically for each container based on their published ports and network settings.'
        iptables: '[AI] `dockerd --iptables` is a command-line option used with Docker, an open-source containerization platform. This option enables Docker to manage iptables rules automatically when containers are run. Iptables is a user-space utility program that allows a system administrator to configure the IP packet filter rules of the Linux kernel firewall, implemented as different Netfilter modules. With `dockerd --iptables`, Docker creates and manages firewall rules for incoming and outgoing network traffic for each container. This helps to isolate containers'' networks and enhance security.'
        ipv6: '[AI] `dockerd --ipv6` is a command-line option for the Docker daemon (dockerd) to enable IPv6 support. IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, which provides larger address space and other advanced features compared to its predecessor IPv4. With IPv6 enabled, Docker containers can communicate with each other and the outside world using IPv6 addresses. This can be beneficial when working in an environment where IPv6 is preferred or required, such as a modern cloud infrastructure.'
        label: '[AI] The `--label` flag in Docker is used to assign metadata key-value pairs to containers or images during creation. It helps in adding custom labels that can be useful for filtering, searching, and organizing resources based on specific tags. This flag accepts one or more label=value pairs separated by comma. For example: `dockerd run --label "app=myapp" --label "environment=production" image:latest`.'
        live-restore: '[AI] `dockerd --live-restore` is a flag used with Docker''s daemon (the background process managing container runtime). It enables live restoration of containers and their associated volumes and networks. In simpler terms, it ensures that the state of running containers, including data in persistent volumes, are preserved across system restarts. This is useful for maintaining consistent container environments when dealing with frequent system reboots or containerization setup on ephemeral systems like cloud instances.'
        log-driver: '[AI] `dockerd --log-driver` is a command-line option used with Docker''s daemon (dockerd) to configure the logging driver for the Docker runtime. The default logging driver is `json-file`. By using a different logging driver, you can change where and how logs are stored or forwarded. For instance, you might choose `syslog`, `gelf`, `awslogs`, or `json-file` with a custom path or maximum size. This option affects the logging of all containers running on the host, ensuring their logs are managed according to your specified configuration.'
        log-level: |-
            [AI] The `--log-level` flag for Docker is used to set the logging level for the Docker daemon. It determines the amount and detail of log output produced by Docker. There are several logging levels, each representing an increasing level of verbosity:

            1. **debug**: Logs all messages, including low-level details that may be irrelevant in normal operation.
            2. **info**: Logs important information about container executions and other Docker events. This is the default log level.
            3. **warning**: Logs warnings, which indicate potential issues that might not prevent successful operation but still require attention.
            4. **error**: Logs critical errors that can prevent successful operation.
            5. **fatal**: Logs fatal errors, which cause Docker to stop processing and exit with a non-zero status code.

            By setting the `--log-level` flag when starting Docker, you can control the amount of log output generated by the daemon, making it easier to manage logs for troubleshooting or monitoring.
        log-opt: |-
            [AI] `dockerd --log-opt` is a command-line option used with Docker's daemon, `dockerd`. This option modifies the logging configuration for the Docker daemon by passing an optional log driver and its associated settings as key-value pairs.

            For example, `--log-opt flag=value` can be used to set various logging options such as `max-size`, `max-file`, `max-logs` for log rotation or `labels` or `key`/`value` pair for custom metadata in logs. This option helps users to configure Docker's logging behavior as per their requirements and preferences.
        max-concurrent-downloads: '[AI] `dockerd --max-concurrent-downloads` is a command line option for Docker''s daemon (dockerd) which sets the maximum number of concurrent downloads of Docker images from registries. It helps manage network bandwidth and resource usage by limiting the number of images that can be downloaded simultaneously. This can be useful in environments where multiple containers are being managed, especially when internet connectivity is limited or when downloading large images could impact other processes.'
        max-concurrent-uploads: '[AI] `dockerd --max-concurrent-uploads` is a command-line option for Docker''s daemon component (dockerd). It sets the maximum number of concurrent image uploads using the Docker Registry interface, also known as Docker Content Trust. When this limit is reached, further attempts to push images will be blocked until one or more existing uploads complete. This can help prevent saturating network connections during large-scale image pushes in container environments.'
        max-download-attempts: '[AI] The `--max-download-attempts` flag in Docker sets the maximum number of attempts for downloading an image from a registry. If an image download fails, Docker will attempt to download it again based on this value until it is successful or reaches the limit set by this flag. The default value is 5 attempts. Increasing this value may help when dealing with unreliable registries, but it may also increase the time required for image pulls.'
        metrics-addr: '[AI] The `--metrics-addr` flag in Docker is used to configure the address and port where Docker''s container metrics are exposed. By default, this feature is disabled. When you set this flag with an argument like `--metrics-addr=0.0.0.0:9323`, it enables the collection and exposure of container resource usage metrics over the network using the Prometheus format. These metrics can be used for monitoring and performance analysis purposes.'
        mtu: '[AI] `dockerd --mtu` is a command-line option for Docker''s daemon (dockerd) that sets the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for the Docker overlay network interfaces. The MTU is the maximum size of a data packet that can be transmitted on a network. Setting it can improve network performance and reduce packet fragmentation in certain network environments, particularly when using large container images or transferring large files. The value should be specified in bytes (e.g., `--mtu 1500` for the default Ethernet frame size).'
        network-control-plane-mtu: '[AI] The `--network-control-plane-mtu` flag in Docker is used to configure the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size for the Docker network control plane. MTU refers to the maximum size of a single datagram that can be transmitted between two endpoints over a particular network connection. Setting this flag allows you to optimize network performance by adjusting the MTU size to match the specific requirements of your network infrastructure. By default, Docker sets the MTU size to 1500 bytes. However, in certain environments with larger packets or specialized networks like Jumbo Frames, setting a higher or lower MTU value can improve communication efficiency and reduce packet loss.'
        no-new-privileges: '[AI] The `--no-new-privileges` flag is a command-line option for Docker''s `dockerd` daemon. When this flag is used, Docker containers will not be started with new privileges, meaning they will run with the same permissions as their user on the host system. This can enhance security by limiting the potential impact of a compromised container. However, it might also limit the functionality of some applications that require special permissions to operate effectively.'
        node-generic-resource: |-
            [AI] The `--node-generic-resources` flag in Docker is used to configure the amount of system resources (CPU, memory, network, and storage) that the Docker daemon (dockerd) should consider when scheduling containers on a node.

            This flag allows you to set resource limits for the node as a whole, rather than per container. By default, Docker does not apply any resource limits at the node level. Setting this flag enables you to limit the total resources that can be consumed by all containers running on that node, ensuring that the host system has sufficient resources for other processes and applications.

            For example, you could set a CPU quota of 2 CPUs or a memory limit of 8GB using the following command:
            ```
            dockerd --node-generic-resources.cpu.quota=2 --node-generic-resources.memory.limit=8g
            ```
            Keep in mind that setting resource limits for the node can impact the performance and availability of containers running on it, so it's essential to carefully consider the system requirements and resource allocation before applying these settings.
        oom-score-adjust: '[AI] `dockerd --oom-score-adjust` is a command line option for Docker''s daemon (dockerd). It adjusts the Out of Memory (OOM) scoring for containers. The OOM killer is a Linux kernel feature that terminates processes when the system runs out of memory to prevent a total system crash. By default, all containers have an equal OOM score. However, this option allows setting custom scores for individual containers or their parent images. A higher score increases the likelihood that a container will be killed before others when the system runs low on memory.'
        pidfile: '[AI] The `--pidfile` flag is a command-line option for Docker''s dockerd daemon. It specifies that the daemon should write its process ID (PID) to the specified file upon successful start. This can be useful for managing and monitoring the daemon, as other system processes or scripts can use the PID information to interact with the running dockerd instance.'
        raw-logs: '[AI] `dockerd --raw-logs` is a command used with Docker''s daemon (dockerd) to stream real-time logs from a specific container in their raw format. The raw logs include the original unfiltered and unformatted messages generated by the container, including timestamps and logging levels if applicable. This command is useful for advanced users or scripts that require low-level access to container logs.'
        registry-mirror: '[AI] The `dockerd --registry-mirror` flag is used in Docker to configure a registry mirror, which is an alternative Docker registry server to use when the preferred registry is unavailable or slow. By setting this flag to a registry URL, Docker will attempt to pull images from that mirror instead of the original registry specified in the image name. This can improve the performance and reliability of image downloads. For example: `dockerd --registry-mirror=https://mirror.example.com`'
        rootless: '[AI] `dockerd --rootless` is a command-line option for Docker, the open-source containerization platform. It allows Docker to be run in a "rootless" mode, meaning containers are not run with root privileges and are instead contained within a host directory specified by the user. This improves security as it isolates containers from the host system more effectively than traditional Docker setup where containers share the same kernel namespace as the host. Additionally, this mode allows Docker to be used in environments where running containers as root is not allowed or not desired.'
        seccomp-profile: '[AI] `dockerd --seccomp-profile` is a command-line option for Docker''s daemon process. It allows specifying a custom SECCOMP profile file to apply security policies on containers at the Linux kernel level. The SECCOMP (Security Compute Machine) profile defines rules that restrict system calls made by containers to only those allowed, enhancing container isolation and security.'
        selinux-enabled: '[AI] The `--selinux-enabled` flag for the Docker daemon (dockerd) enables SELinux (Security-Enforced Linux) policy enforcement on the Docker containers running on a system with SELinux enabled. SELinux is a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security system that helps protect Linux systems from malicious software and unauthorized access by enforcing strict access control policies. By enabling this flag, Docker will conform to the SELinux policies in place on the host system, providing an additional layer of security.'
        shutdown-timeout: '[AI] `dockerd --shutdown-timeout` is a command-line option for Docker daemon (dockerd) that sets the grace period before Docker containers are forcefully stopped during system shutdown or when using the `docker kill` command with the `--signal=SIGTERM` flag. The default value is 5 minutes (300 seconds). Increasing this timeout can help prevent containers from being terminated prematurely, giving them more time to save data or gracefully shut down themselves. However, longer timeout values may delay system shutdown or reboot.'
        storage-driver: |-
            [AI] `dockerd --storage-driver` is a command-line option used with Docker's container runtime, Docker Daemon (dockerd), to configure the storage driver it should use for managing container data.

            Docker uses various storage drivers like auction, overlay2, sandbox, etc., each providing different features and optimizations. By specifying a particular driver via `--storage-driver`, users can customize Docker's data management behavior to suit their requirements. For instance, one may opt for `overlay2` for better performance in multi-host scenarios or `sandbox` for simpler use cases with minimal data sharing between containers.

            In summary, the option `--storage-driver` allows users to choose a specific storage driver when running the Docker daemon, ultimately influencing how container data is managed and stored on the system.
        storage-opt: '[AI] `dockerd --storage-opt` is a command-line option used with Docker''s daemon (dockerd) to configure its storage settings. Specifically, it''s used to set custom options for the Docker storage driver. For example, `--storage-opt=type=fsdaemon,size=10g` sets the storage driver type to `fsdaemon` and allocates a 10GB size for the underlying filesystem. The exact format is `--storage-opt=key=value`, where `key` is the name of the option and `value` is its value. This allows users to fine-tune their Docker storage setup.'
        swarm-default-advertise-addr: '[AI] The `--swarm-default-advertise-addr` flag in Docker is used when running a swarm manager node. It sets the IP address that will be advertised to other nodes in the Swarm cluster for this manager node to join and discover each other. This helps ensure that all nodes can communicate with one another correctly for proper clustering and orchestration functionality within Docker Swarm.'
        tls: '[AI] `dockerd --tls` is a command-line option for Docker''s daemon (the background service that manages containers). It enables Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for the Docker API, which secures communications between Docker clients and servers. This improves security by encrypting traffic and verifying the identity of both parties involved in the communication.'
        tlscacert: '[AI] `dockerd --tls-ca-cert` is a command-line option for Docker''s daemon process (dockerd) to enable TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption for the API interface. The `--tls-ca-cert` flag specifies the location of the trusted Certificate Authority (CA) file used to sign the server''s certificate in the SSL/TLS handshake between clients and the Docker daemon, ensuring secure communication over the network.'
        tlscert: '[AI] The `--tlscert` flag in the `dockerd` command relates to Transport Layer Security (TLS) certification for secure communication between Docker clients and the Docker daemon. By using this flag, you can specify a custom TLS certificate file or a directory containing the certificate files for SSL/TLS encrypted communication. This is an additional security measure that helps protect data transmitted between the client and server in Docker environments.'
        tlskey: '[AI] `dockerd --tlskey` is a command-line option used with Docker''s daemon (dockerd) to enable secure communication using Transport Layer Security (TLS). The `--tlskey` flag specifies the path to the private key file for the TLS certificate. When used in conjunction with other TLS-related flags like `--tlscacert` and `--cert`, it helps encrypt Docker communications between clients and the daemon, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.'
        tlsverify: '[AI] `dockerd --tlsverify` is a command-line option for Docker''s daemon (dockerd) that enables Transport Layer Security (TLS) verification for API requests. With this option, the Docker daemon only listens for TLS encrypted connections to its API. This enhances the security of your Docker environment by ensuring that all communication between clients (like `docker` CLI or other tools) and the daemon is encrypted, preventing potential man-in-the-middle attacks.'
        userland-proxy: '[AI] `dockerd --userland-proxy` is a command-line option for Docker''s daemon (the background service that manages containers). It enables Userland Proxy mode, which allows Docker to act as a reverse proxy for the containers'' network services. This means that Docker exposes the container services on the host system, allowing external traffic to reach them via the Docker daemon. This can be useful in environments where direct exposure of container ports is not possible or desirable, such as behind a firewall or in a cloud environment with restricted access. It simplifies network routing and security management by centralizing the exposure of containers'' services through the Docker daemon.'
        userland-proxy-path: '[AI] The `--userland-proxy-path` flag in Docker is used to specify a Unix domain socket file path for Docker to use as the proxy endpoint for userland (non-root) proxies. Userland proxies are an alternative to the built-in Docker proxy for forwarding network traffic from containers. This flag enables using custom userland proxies, which can provide additional features or be integrated with specific network configurations.'
        userns-remap: '[AI] `dockerd --userns-remap` is a command-line option for Docker''s daemon (dockerd). It enables User Namespace Remapping, which allows the Docker daemon to run containers with user IDs other than the one running the daemon itself. By default, containers run with the same UID/GID as the Docker host. However, using `--userns-remap` can help improve security and isolation by ensuring that containers use unique and distinct user IDs from their hosts. This option is particularly useful when managing multi-container environments or when deploying applications requiring specific user permissions.'
        version: '[AI] `dockerd --version` is a command used to check the version information of Docker daemon (dockerd), which is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows you to easily create, deploy, and run applications using container technology. When executed, it displays the version number, build time, and other relevant information such as the operating system and architecture on which Docker is installed.'
