documentation:
    command: '[AI] `xdotool windowmove` is a command-line tool for interacting with the graphical environment in Linux and other Unix systems using the X Window System. Specifically, the `windowmove` subcommand moves an existing window to a new position on the screen. Its syntax is as follows: `xdotool windowmove <window_id> <x> <y>`, where `<window_id>` refers to the unique identifier of the window to be moved, and `<x>` and `<y>` are the new coordinates in pixels for the window''s top-left corner.'
    flag:
        relative: '[AI] `xdotool windowmove --relative` is a command used in the xdotool tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical environment. This specific command moves the focused window relative to its current position. The `--relative` option indicates that the movement will be relative to the window''s current position rather than moving it to an absolute screen coordinate.'
        sync: |-
            [AI] `xdotool windowmove --sync` is a command from the xdotool toolkit used in Linux and Unix-based systems for automating interaction with the X Window System graphical user interface (GUI).

            The `windowmove` subcommand moves a specific window to new coordinates. The `--sync` option ensures that the operation waits for the window manager to finish processing the request before continuing with further commands. This option is useful when moving multiple windows or in scripts where precise timing is important.
