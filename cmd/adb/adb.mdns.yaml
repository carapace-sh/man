documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `adb mdns` command is used with Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to register or unregister Multicast DNS (mDNS) records for an Android device. mDNS allows devices to discover each other on a local network by using their hostnames instead of IP addresses. The `adbs shell mdns-admin` command provides the interface for managing these records. Without any specific option, `adb mdns [register|unregister] <hostname> <service>` registers or unregisters a specific mDNS record with the given hostname and service name.'
