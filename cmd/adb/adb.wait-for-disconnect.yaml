description: wait for device to be in given state
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `adb wait-for-disconnect` command is a part of Android Debug Bridge (ADB) toolset. It is used to pause the execution of a script or command in ADB until an Android device is disconnected from the debugging session. This can be useful when you need to ensure that a specific action only occurs after the device has been physically disconnected, for example, during automated testing or system maintenance tasks. When executed, `adb wait-for-disconnect` command will pause the script execution and resume it once the device is unplugged from the USB connection.'
