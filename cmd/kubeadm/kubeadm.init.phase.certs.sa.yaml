documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubeadm init phase certs sa` is a sub-command used in Kubernetes to generate and configure TLS certificates for the Kubernetes API server''s ServiceAccounts. The command interacts with the `kubeadm` tool, which is used for bootstrapping a Kubernetes cluster. This specific command is executed during the initial setup phase of a new Kubernetes cluster and should be run on the machine that will host the API server. By executing this command, Kubernetes creates and configures certificates that enable secure communication between the ServiceAccounts and API server within the cluster.'

            [AI] The `kubeadm init` command is used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase certs sa --cert-dir` subcommand is used during this process to create and manage the Certificate Authority (CA) and Service Account (SA) certificates for Kubernetes.

            More specifically, `--cert-dir` option sets the directory where the generated CA and SA certificates will be stored. These certificates are essential for securing communication between various components of the cluster such as the etcd server, API server, and worker nodes. The generated certificates can later be used to join new worker nodes to the cluster or create new client applications that need to interact with the Kubernetes API.
