documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tmux unlink-window` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. It removes the binding of a window to a specific pane within a TMUX session, allowing that pane to be occupied by another window or session. When you run this command with the ID or name of the target window, it detaches that window from its current pane. This command is useful when managing multiple windows and sessions in a TMUX environment.'
    flag:
        k: '[AI] `tmux unlink-window` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer software. The `-k` flag is an optional argument that specifies which window to unlink based on its key identifier. When used together, this command unlinks the window with the specified key ID from its parent pane or session. This means that the window will no longer be part of any larger structure in Tmux and can be detached as a separate entity.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux` command `unlink-window -t <window-id>` is used to detach and remove a window in the `tmux` terminal multiplexer. This command detaches the specified window identified by `<window-id>` from its session, and then removes it entirely. When you run this command, the window will no longer be accessible within the `tmux` session. It is often used when a user wants to clean up unused windows in a `tmux` session.'
