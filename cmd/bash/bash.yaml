documentation:
    command: '[AI] `bash` is a popular Unix/Linux terminal shell and command language. It stands for "Bourne-Again SHell," named after its predecessor, the Bourne Shell (sh). Bash provides features for reading, writing, and executing files in the command line environment. It supports various programming constructs, allows input/output redirection, and has a large number of built-in commands for performing common tasks, such as file management, process manipulation, and I/O stream manipulation.'
    flag:
        c: '[AI] The `bash -c` command is a way to pass a single shell command or a script as an argument to the Bash shell for execution. The `-c` option instructs Bash to read and execute the given command from its standard input, rather than reading commands from a file or interactively from the terminal. For example, `bash -c ''echo "Hello World"''` will print "Hello World" when executed.'
        debugger: '[AI] The `--debugger` flag is a feature in Bash, the Unix/Linux shell, which starts the Bash debugger when an error occurs during script execution. It allows users to inspect the values of variables and the flow of the script at the point of failure, helping to identify and resolve issues in the script. This can be useful for understanding complex scripts or troubleshooting errors, making it a valuable tool for shell script developers.'
        dump-po-strings: '[AI] `bash --dump-po-strings` is a command used in GNU Bash to extract all gettext translated strings from Bash source files. The option `--dump-po-strings` tells Bash to output the strings in Portable Object (PO) format, which can be used as input for gettext tools to create translation files. These files are essential for localizing software applications, allowing them to support multiple languages.'
        dump-strings: '[AI] `bash --dump-strings` is a command in Bash shell used to extract all strings literals from the given files. It searches for patterns that match double-quoted or single-quoted strings and prints them out to the standard output. This can be useful for quickly extracting readable strings from configuration files, scripts, or other text data for analysis or identification purposes.'
        i: '[AI] The `bash --init-file` or shorthand `bash -i` option is used when starting a new Bash shell instance. It causes Bash to read and execute commands from the file specified in the `$BASH_INITFILE` or `$HOME/.bashrc` (by default) environment variable before running any interactive commands entered by the user. This is commonly used for setting up custom environment variables, aliases, or other shell configurations.'
        init-file: '[AI] The `--init-file` option in Bash is used to specify a file containing shell commands that will be executed during the initialization of a new Bash session. This is often used with interactive shells, such as those launched from a terminal or login shell, to set up custom configurations or environment variables. The file is typically located at `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` in Unix-based systems. When the shell starts, it reads and executes the commands in the specified file, allowing for user-defined behavior and preferences.'
        login: '[AI] The `--login` option is a flag used in the Bash shell to indicate that the shell instance should be interactive, login-shell compatible. This means it will perform certain tasks upon initialization, such as setting the environment variables based on system files (like /etc/profile, ~/.bash_profile, etc.) and running a user''s shell-specific startup scripts (~/.bashrc or ~/.profile). This flag is typically used when starting a shell session through a login terminal, like SSH.'
        noediting: '[AI] The `--noediting` flag is a option used in Bash, a popular Unix/Linux shell. It''s primarily used to disable Bash''s default feature of trying to edit the command line when you press the up arrow key. This can be useful when working in scripts or situations where you don''t want unintended modifications to your command history. The flag is set with the `set --noediting` command, and it persists until the shell session is terminated.'
        noprofile: '[AI] The `--noprofile` option in Bash is used to prevent Bash from reading or executing any startup files, such as `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`, when a new Bash session is started. This can be useful when you want to start a Bash session with a clean environment, without any additional configurations or settings that might be defined in those files.'
        norc: '[AI] The `--norc` flag is an option for the Bash shell. It prevents Bash from loading the `~/.bashrc` file during startup, which contains various configurations and settings for the shell. By using `--norc`, Bash skips this step, providing a more minimal environment when starting a new shell instance.'
        posix: '[AI] `bash --posix` is a command line option used in Bash shell to enable POSIX mode. POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface for Unix) mode ensures that Bash conforms to the IEEE Std 1003.2-2008, also known as POSIX.1:2008. In this mode, certain Bash extensions and non-standard behaviors are disabled, making scripts more portable across different Unix systems. This option can be useful when writing scripts intended to run on multiple systems with varying Bash versions or configurations.'
        r: '[AI] The `-r` option in the `bash` shell refers to the "recursive" mode for the `cd` (change directory) command. When used with `cd`, it allows changing directories to subdirectories of the specified directory recursively. For example, `cd -r /path/to/directory` will change the current working directory to `/path/to/directory` and all its subdirectories under it.'
        rcfile: '[AI] The `--rcfile` option in Bash is used to specify a file containing initialization commands that will be executed when Bash starts up as an interactive shell. This file overrides any default startup files like `~/.bashrc` or `/etc/bash.bashrc`. Using `--rcfile filename` instructs Bash to read and execute the commands from `filename` before running any other interactive commands.'
        restricted: '[AI] The `bash --restricted` or `bash --runtime` option starts a new bash shell with a restricted environment. This means that certain actions are disabled or limited, such as changing directories, setting environment variables, or executing scripts from the command line. It''s often used in chroot environments or to run untrusted code with minimal privileges to reduce potential security risks. The primary goal is to provide a more controlled and secure shell environment.'
        s: '[AI] The `bash -s` option is used with the `source` command in Bash shell scripting. It tells Bash to read and execute the contents of a file as if it were the Bash command-line arguments, rather than sourcing the file directly. In other words, it passes the commands in the file as arguments to the current shell process instead of creating a new subshell. This can be useful when you want to pass variables or functions defined in one script to another script without creating a nested subshell hierarchy.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `--verbose` flag in Bash is used to increase the amount of output displayed during command execution. It makes Bash print more information about what it''s doing, including messages about sourcing files, executing functions, and encountering certain errors. This option is helpful for debugging scripts or understanding the flow of complex commands.'
        version: |-
            [AI] `bash --version` is a command used in Unix-based systems to display the version information of the Bash shell that's currently in use. When run in a terminal or command line interface, it returns output similar to:

            ```
            GNU bash, version 5.0.17(1-generic)
            copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

            ```

            The output consists of:

            1. "GNU bash" - Identifies the shell as Bash (Bourne Again SHell).
            2. Version number - Indicates the specific version, such as 5.0.17.
            3. Build information - Additional details like the operating system's distribution and build number.
            4. Copyright information - Details about the Free Software Foundation and permissions for using Bash.
        x: '[AI] The `--x` option is not a valid flag in Bash (Bourne-Again SHell). There is no such option in Bash''s built-in help or manual. It seems like you might have misspelled or misunderstood an existing flag or command. To check the list of valid options and their meanings for any Bash command, use `man bash` or `help bash` followed by the specific command (if applicable).'
