    command: '[AI] `gh codespace` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create, start, or manage development environments called "codespaces" directly from the GitHub repository in GitHub''s cloud. These codespaces offer pre-configured development environments with your project code and desired dependencies, allowing you to develop locally without having to set up and configure your local development environment every time. You can interactively use these codespaces using a web-based terminal or SSH connection. To learn more about specific commands, refer to the `gh codespace` documentation on GitHub.'
