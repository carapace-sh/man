    command: '[AI] `packer` is an open-source tool for building machine images, virtual machine disc images, and other artifacts used in cloud computing. The `packer version` command is used to check or print the installed version of Packer in your terminal or script.

This command helps ensure that everyone on a team or in an organization is using the same version of Packer for consistency and avoids potential compatibility issues.'
