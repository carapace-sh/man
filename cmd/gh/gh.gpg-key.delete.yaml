documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `gh gpg-key delete` command is used to delete a specific GPG key from your GitHub account. This command interacts with GitHub''s Key Management service and removes the public key associated with that key ID or email address, preventing it from being used for authenticating Git operations. Once deleted, you will no longer be able to use this key to make authenticated actions on repositories linked to your account.'
    flag:
        confirm: '[AI] The command `gh config gpg.keyring <path_to_keyring>` sets the path to a GPG keyring used by GitHub''s Git CLI tool (gh) for signing commits and tags. The command `gh gpg-key delete --confirm` is used to delete a specific GPG key from this keyring. The `--confirm` flag is used to confirm that the user really wants to perform this action without any further prompts. Once deleted, the specified GPG key can no longer be used for signing Git commits or tags with gh.'
        "yes": '[AI] The command `gh config user.signingkey <key-id>` sets the Github SSH key used for authentication. `gpg` is a tool for managing and verifying PGP keys. The command `gh gpg-key delete --yes <key-id>` deletes a specific GPG key identified by its key ID from your local GPG keyring with the `--yes` flag to confirm without asking for further input. This can be useful if you accidentally added or imported a key that shouldn''t have been in your keyring.'
