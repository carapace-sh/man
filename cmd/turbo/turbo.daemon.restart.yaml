description: Restarts the turbo daemon
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `turbo daemon restart` command is used to restart the Turbo daemon process on a system. Daemons are background processes that run continuously to perform specific functions. In this case, "Turbo" likely refers to a particular software application or service with a corresponding daemon process. By issuing the `restart` command, the system will gracefully stop the running instance of the Turbo daemon and then start a new one. This can be useful when troubleshooting issues, implementing configuration changes, or updating the daemon itself.'
