    command: '[AI] The `showkey` command is not a standard Unix or Linux command. It seems to be specific to certain implementations of Terminal Services or Remote Desktop Services, such as those found in Windows operating systems. Its purpose is to display the keyboard layout and key mappings currently in use for input in a remote session. This can be helpful when using different keyboard layouts or when troubleshooting input issues.'
    flag:
        ascii: '[AI] `showkey --ascii` is a command from the xkeybox utility in X Window System. It displays the ASCII codes and labels of keys bound to a specific keybinding file or X11 keyboard shortcut. The output shows each key followed by its corresponding ASCII code, making it useful for debugging and understanding the mappings of keyboard shortcuts in X11 applications.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `showkey --help` is a command used in the xkeybind package for generating and managing X11 keyboard shortcuts. The `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use this command, including available options, their meanings, and examples. Here's a brief summary of what you can expect from the output:

            - Usage instructions: The basic usage of the command is shown, such as `showkey [OPTION]... [KEYS]...`
            - Options: A list of command-line options with their short forms and descriptions, if applicable. For instance, `--quiet`, `--version`, etc.
            - Examples: Simple examples of how to use the command to display or modify keyboard shortcuts.
            - Keys: Explanation on how to specify keys in various formats.
            - Bind files: Information on the default bind file and its location, as well as creating custom bind files.
            - Editing keys: Instructions for editing existing keys, adding new ones, or deleting unwanted ones.
            - Generating new keys: Description of how to generate new key sequences using various methods.
            - Exit codes: A list of possible exit codes and their meanings.
        keycodes: '[AI] `showkey --keycodes` is a command-line utility in the xkeycode package for Linux and other Unix-like systems. It displays the keycode numbers associated with each key pressed on a connected keyboard. The output shows the keycode, scancode, and sometimes symbolic name of the key. This information can be useful for configuring custom keybindings or for debugging issues related to keyboard input.'
        scancodes: '[AI] `showkey --scancodes` is a command-line utility in Linux that displays the scan codes of keys pressed on the keyboard. Scan codes are unique numerical values assigned to each keypress event by the kernel, allowing applications to identify and interpret specific key events. By using this command with the `--scancodes` option, you can view the corresponding scan code for each key press in real-time, making it useful for debugging or understanding low-level keyboard interactions.'
        version: '[AI] The command `showkey --version` is used to display the version information of the ShowKey software. ShowKey is a graphical X11 utility designed to capture and display keyboard input in real time, which can be helpful for debugging or monitoring keyboard activity. By running this command, you''ll get output containing the name of the ShowKey software, its version number, and sometimes additional build information. This information helps users determine if they are running the latest version or identify any potential compatibility issues with other software.'
