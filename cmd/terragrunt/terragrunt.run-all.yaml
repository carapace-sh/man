        [AI] `terraform init` and `terraform apply` are common commands used in Terraform to initialize a working directory and apply infrastructure changes, respectively. However, when managing multiple Terrform modules or workspaces, it can be time-consuming to run these commands individually for each one.

        `terragrunt run-all` is a command provided by the Terraform wrapper tool `Terragrunt`. It automates the process of initializing and applying Terraform configurations across multiple directories or workspaces in parallel. In other words, `terragrunt run-all` runs the equivalent of `terraform init && terraform apply` for all the Terrform setups under its control. This can save time and effort when managing complex infrastructure deployments with multiple Terraform configurations.
