documentation:
    command: '[AI] The term "helix" is a geometric shape described as a spiral that forms if you wind a rope around a cone or cylinder. In biology, it''s often used to describe the structure of DNA and some proteins where two long polymers wind around each other in a helical pattern. There isn''t a specific command named "helix" in common computing contexts.'
    flag:
        config: '[AI] The `helm install` or `helm upgrade` command with the `--config` flag is used to specify a custom values file for Helm (the Kubernetes Package Manager) when deploying or upgrading a chart. This flag allows you to override specific chart values, providing greater flexibility and control over your application configuration without modifying the original chart files directly.'
        grammar: '[AI] The `--grammar` flag in Helix, a code editor from GitKraken, is used to specify or load a custom syntax definition for the editor. This flag enables Helix to correctly parse and highlight specific file types or languages based on the defined grammar rules. By providing a valid path to a grammar file or using an URL to remote grammars, users can extend the functionality of Helix to support various programming languages and markup languages that are not included by default.'
        health: '[AI] The `--health` flag in Helix, a platform for deploying and managing Kubernetes applications, is used to check the status of running services or pods. It returns an HTTP response indicating whether each service or pod is considered healthy based on their readiness and liveness probes configured in the Kubernetes manifest files. If all probes pass, the flag returns a 200 OK status. The output may include additional details such as container ports and status messages.'
        help: '[AI] The `--help` option when used with the `helix` command displays detailed information about the Helix Data Platform CLI tool. It provides an overview of Helix and its various subcommands, along with usage examples and options for each command. This information helps users understand how to effectively use Helix to manage their data infrastructure.'
        hsplit: '[AI] The `helix --hsplit` command is a feature of the Helix3D software for visualizing and manipulating 3D data. It performs horizontal slicing, which means splitting the data along flat planes parallel to the XY plane. This results in creating 2D sections or projections of the original 3D data for further analysis or visualization.'
        log: '[AI] The `--log` flag in Helix, a data platform built by MapR, is used to configure logging settings for Helix components such as ZooKeeper, YARN, HBase, and others. When this flag is passed during Helix command execution, it specifies the location of the log files and their formats (e.g., `--log FILE:/path/to/logs,FORMAT:LOG4J`). This helps in managing and monitoring the logs effectively for troubleshooting and performance analysis purposes.'
        tutor: '[AI] The `--tutor` flag in Helix Pipeline (a GitOps platform by Microsoft) is used to enable the Helix Tutor component. This component provides automated validation, security scanning, and approval workflows for your infrastructure configuration files before they are applied to your environment using Helix. By enabling it, you can ensure that only approved configurations are deployed, helping maintain compliance and security within your infrastructure.'
        v: '[AI] The `helix-v` flag is specific to Helix, a data versioning and collaboration tool developed by Hashicorp. When used with the `helix` command in a terminal or shell environment, the `-v` (or `--verbose`) flag increases the amount of output provided during Helix operations. This can be useful for debugging or gaining more insight into what Helix is doing behind the scenes, as it will display additional information about each step taken during a given command. However, keep in mind that this increased verbosity may also result in more output being displayed, which could potentially make your terminal session cluttered and harder to read if used excessively.'
        version: '[AI] The command `helix --version` is used to check for the current version of Helix, a text editor and terminal application developed by Stripe. When executed in a terminal or command-line interface, it will display the version number and build information associated with the installed instance of Helix, allowing users to verify that they are running the latest stable release or checking for any available updates.'
        vsplit: |-
            [AI] The `--vsplit` option in FFmpeg's Helix DVR transcode command (`helix --vsplit`) is used to split video frames into interleaved GOPs (Groups of Pictures) during encoding. This process improves the compression efficiency and reduces the bitrate required for streaming or storage.

            In more detail, this option splits the original input video stream's frames into multiple output streams having the same duration but differing in the frame indices within each Group of Pictures (GOP). As a result, the output files will have more uniformly sized keyframes and better support for seeking within the video. This is particularly useful when dealing with live streaming or on-demand media services.
        working-dir: '[AI] The `--working-dir` option in Helix, a version control system, sets the local working directory for a Helix repository. This is the folder on your local machine where you will make modifications to the files in the repository. By default, Helix uses the current working directory, but specifying a different path with `--working-dir` allows you to keep your working files separate from other projects or repositories.'
