    command: |-
        [AI] The `waypoint auth-method` command is used in Waypoint, a multi-cloud application delivery platform by Hashicorp, to configure the authentication method for connecting to a specific target. This could be setting up basic authentication, OAuth2, or other supported methods like JWT, AWS IAM, or Azure Active Directory. The command takes arguments specifying the target name and the desired authentication method along with any required configuration details. For example:

        ```bash
        waypoint auth-method my_target oauth2 --client_id <your_client_id> --client_secret <your_client_secret>
        ```
