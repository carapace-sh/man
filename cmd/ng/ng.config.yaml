It can be followed by a specific configuration file path and key to set or get the value of a particular configuration option.

        global: '[AI] `ng config --global` is a command used in Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) to configure global settings for an Angular project. The `--global` option indicates that the changes will be applied to the Angular CLI configuration file, which is usually located at `~/.angular.json` on Unix-based systems and `C:\Users\<username>\.angular.json` on Windows. This command allows you to set default options for new projects or modify existing global configurations. For example, you can use it to configure a preferred style guideline or set up default build optimizations.'
