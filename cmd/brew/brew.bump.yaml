documentation:
    command: '[AI] `brew bump` is a Homebrew command used to increment the version number of installed packages in the `Homebrew/packages` Git repository locally, following Homebrew''s semantic versioning rules. By default, it bumps only the installed head dependency of the package, but it can be used with additional flags for more complex scenarios. The changes are not pushed back to the original repository unless explicitly specified.'
    flag:
        cask: '[AI] `brew bump` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--cask` option specifies that you want to update casks (i.e., applications packaged as installers), rather than command-line tools or other system packages managed by Homebrew. When you run `brew bump --cask`, it will update the versions of your installed cask apps to the latest available, and also increase their version numbers locally in your Homebrew configuration files. This can be useful for keeping your applications up-to-date without manually downloading and installing new versions each time.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew bump --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to increment the version number of a formula in Homebrew, specifically moving to the next patch (minor) release. The `--debug` flag enables verbose output, providing more detailed information about the process, which can be helpful for debugging or understanding what changes are being made.'
        formula: |-
            [AI] The `brew bump` command is a tool used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. It's designed to update formulae (Homebrew's term for packages) to the next stable version, while keeping dependencies at their current versions.

            The `--formula` option specifies which particular formula you want to update. For example: `brew bump --formula my-package`. This command will attempt to find a new version of 'my-package' that is higher than the currently installed one, but lower than the latest head or master branch (which may not be stable).

            The result will be a new 'Latest' tag on your local Homebrew repository and an updated formula file in `/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Formulas`. Once applied with `brew update` and `brew install`, your system will have the newer version of 'my-package'.
        full-name: |-
            [AI] The `brew bump` command is a utility provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to increment the version number of an installed Homebrew package in the formula, headed project on GitHub, and update the corresponding tap. The `--full-name` option specifies that the new version number should be based on the full name of the formula, including the repository prefix if applicable.

            For instance, if there's a formula named `myproject/myformula`, and you run `brew bump myformula --full-name`, Homebrew will increment the major, minor, or patch version number in the formula based on the current branch and create a new Git tag and commit. This updated version information is then synced with the corresponding tap, allowing other users to install the updated package via Homebrew.
        help: |-
            [AI] `brew bump` is a command-line tool used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--help` option is used to display detailed information about how to use this specific command. Here's a brief explanation:

            `brew bump` helps manage version numbers of Homebrew installations. With the `--help` option, you can view usage instructions and available subcommands, including:

            - `brews`: List all brews (installed packages) whose major version number can be bumped.
            - `HEAD`: Update the installed package to the latest version in the Git repository.
            - `major`, `minor`, or `patch`: Bump a specific version component, such as major, minor, or patch.

            Usage example: `brew bump HEAD mypackage`. This command updates 'mypackage' to the latest version from its Git repository.
        installed: '[AI] `brew bump --installed` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command bumps (upgrades) the installed versions of all Homebrew packages to their latest revisions. It only affects the currently installed packages and does not modify the pinned or tap formulas. The purpose is to keep the system up-to-date with the latest security patches and improvements.'
        limit: '[AI] `brew bump` is a command-line tool for managing version numbers in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. The `--limit` option sets a limit on how many major version numbers can be bumped during an update. For example, `brew bump --major --limit=1` would allow updating to the next major version but no further. It''s useful for maintaining control over upgrades and avoiding unintended major version jumps.'
        no-pull-requests: '[AI] The `brew bump` command is a function in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, used to increment the version number of installed packages or formulas in their corresponding Git repositories. The `--no-pull-requests` flag disables the creation and merging of pull requests when updating the repository. This means that the changes made by `brew bump` are directly pushed to the main branch without review, which can be useful for development environments but should be used with caution in production or shared repositories due to potential risks such as introducing unintended changes or conflicts.'
        open-pr: |-
            [AI] `brew bump` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The specific command `brew bump --open-pr` performs an automated version bump in your Homebrew-managed projects.

            Here's what it does:

            1. It identifies the current Git branch and checks if there are any open Pull Requests (PRs) on GitHub.
            2. For each package in the Homebrew installation that has a corresponding Git repository, it performs an automated version bump using one of several strategies (major, minor, or patch), depending on the `bump` subcommand used.
            3. It then generates a commit with the version bump and pushes it to the origin branch.
            4. It creates a new Pull Request (PR) against the original repository on GitHub, opening it and displaying its URL in the terminal for further action.

            This command can save developers time by automating the process of updating package versions, creating PRs, and initiating the review process.
        quiet: '[AI] `brew bump --quiet` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command bumps (increases) the version number of the installed package in the formula repository, but does so quietly without displaying any messages or progress indicators during the process. This can be useful when running automated scripts or builds where verbosity is not desired.'
        start-with: '[AI] `brew bump --start-with` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to increment the version number of a specific formula or package in the Homebrew installation, starting from a specified version. For example, `brew bump head` would increment the version number to the next major release, while `brew bump 1.2.3` would increment it to the next patch release after 1.2.3. The `--start-with` option allows you to specify which formula or package to start with when applying the version bump to multiple formulas or packages.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew bump` is a command used by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--verbose` flag is an option that increases the amount of output or detail given during the execution of the command. When using `brew bump --verbose`, the command will display more information about the version number bumping process, such as the current repository and branch, commit message, and changes made to the formula file. This can be helpful for understanding what exactly is happening during the version update.'
