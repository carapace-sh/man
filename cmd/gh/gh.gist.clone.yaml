        [AI] The `gh` command with the `gist clone` sub-command is used to download a GitHub Gist as a local file or directory. This command requires that you have GitHub CLI (gh) installed on your system and that you are authenticated with your GitHub account.

        To use this command, provide the Gist's ID or URL as an argument, like so: `gh gist clone <GIST_ID>` or `gh gist clone <GIST_URL>`. The command will then download the contents of the specified Gist to your current working directory.

        If a Gist contains multiple files, it will be cloned as a new subdirectory with the name of the Gist in your current directory. Each file in the Gist will be saved in this subdirectory with its original file name and content.
