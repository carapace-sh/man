name: verify-tag
description: Check the GPG signature of tags
flags:
    --format=: format to use for the output
    --raw: print raw gpg status output
    -v, --verbose: print tag contents
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git verify-tag` is a Git command used to validate the authenticity of a tag object in a Git repository. It does this by checking the tag''s signature against the public keys stored in the `git-config` file or in GPG keyrings. This helps ensure that the tag was created by someone trusted and hasn''t been tampered with since creation. The command outputs the tag''s verification status, which can be ''good'' (valid) or ''bad'' (invalid).'
    flag:
        format: '[AI] `git verify-tag` is a Git command used to validate the authenticity of a specific tag in a Git repository. The `--format` option specifies how the output of the command should be displayed. For example, `git verify-tag <tag> --format=%h` will print only the tag''s short hash value on the standard output. Other formats can be used to display additional information such as the tag name, signatures, or error messages. It''s important to note that this command requires a GPG key to be configured for Git in order to verify tags signed with a private key.'
        raw: '[AI] `git verify-tag --raw` is a Git command used to validate the authenticity of a given tag by checking its signed tag object against a trusted key or certificate stored in a GPG keyring. The `--raw` option tells Git to output the raw tag object data instead of the usual tag message and commit information. This can be useful when working with remote repositories or when dealing with signed tags that may require manual verification using external tools like GPG.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `git verify-tag` command is used to validate the authenticity of a Git tag object, signed with GPG keys. It takes one argument, which is the name of the tag to be verified. When run with the `--verbose` option, it provides detailed information about the verification process, including the key used for signing, the signature status (good or bad), and any error messages if applicable. In essence, it performs a more detailed and informative check on the authenticity of a Git tag than the default command without the `--verbose` flag.'
