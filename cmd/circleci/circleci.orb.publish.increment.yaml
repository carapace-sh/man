description: Increment a released version of an orb
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `circleci orb publish increment` command is used in CircleCI Orbs, which are reusable collections of CircleCI configuration steps. This command increments the version number of an Orb published to the CircleCI registry and publishes the new version. It assumes that the Orb has already been built and is located in the current working directory as a `.orb` file or a `.git` repository. The published version number can be specified explicitly, otherwise it will be incremented automatically based on the existing version number.'
