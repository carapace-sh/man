    command: '[AI] `go fix` is a command-line tool that comes with the Go programming language. Its primary function is to automatically apply suggested fixes to source code based on static analysis performed by go tools like `govuln` and `golint`. When you run `go fix`, it checks your Go sources for common errors, coding conventions violations, and security vulnerabilities. If any issues are found, it applies the recommended fixes automatically. In other words, `go fix` is a convenient way to apply suggested code improvements to maintain code quality and adhere to best practices in the Go ecosystem.'
