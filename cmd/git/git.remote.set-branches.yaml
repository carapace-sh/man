flags:
    --add: add branch
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `git remote set-branches` command is used to configure branch settings for a named remote in Git. It allows you to specify which local branches correspond to which remote branches, enabling bi-directional synchronization between them. This can be helpful when working with multiple repositories or remote collaborators. When you run this command, you usually provide a list of local and remote branches separated by whitespace as arguments. For example: `git remote set-branches origin master branch1 branch2`. This sets the upstream branch for `master`, `branch1`, and `branch2` with respect to the named remote `origin`.'
    flag:
        add: '[AI] `git remote set-branches --add` is a Git command used to add one or more branches from a remote repository to your local repository''s list of tracking branches. This command modifies the remote configuration in your Git repository and sets up bi-directional branch tracking between your local and remote branches. This allows you to easily fetch, push, merge, and manage changes between the branches on both ends.'
