documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl emergency` is a command used in Linux systems with systemd init system to forcefully stop all unnecessary system services and switch to runlevel 0 (halt or power off) or runlevel 6 (reboot). It''s designed for use during critical situations, such as when the system is experiencing serious errors that may require an immediate reboot or shutdown. This command sends a strong HUP signal to all processes, including system services and daemons, instructing them to terminate gracefully and save their current states before exiting. It also sets up the kernel''s emergency console and switches to text mode output to facilitate troubleshooting from the console during boot.'
