    command: '[AI] `yarn set` is a Yarn CLI command used to configure global and project-specific settings in Yarn workspaces. It allows users to modify or create new keys with values in the `yarn.lock` file, as well as in other Yarn configuration files such as `yarn.config.js`. For example, you can use it to specify custom registries, change cache directories, or set version ranges for dependencies. The syntax is typically `yarn set <key> [value]`.'
