documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `faas-cli template pull` command is used to retrieve a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) template from a registry or remote server, which can then be deployed and executed using the FaaS framework, such as OpenFaaS or FnProject. This action allows developers to easily reuse pre-built and tested templates for their functions instead of starting from scratch, saving time and effort. The syntax is typically `faas-cli template pull [NAME]`, where `[NAME]` represents the name of the desired template.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `faas-cli template pull --debug` is a command used with the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) CLI tool to retrieve a Function Template from a specified source, such as a registry or a local directory. The `--debug` flag enables debug mode during the execution of the command, which prints out detailed information about the process, including any errors or warnings that may occur. This can be useful for troubleshooting and understanding what''s happening behind the scenes when working with FaaS templates.'
        overwrite: '[AI] The `faas-cli template pull --overwrite` command is used in Faas (Function as a Service) to pull an existing function template from a registry, replacing any existing local template with the same name. This command helps ensure that the local template is up-to-date with the latest version of the template from the registry, maintaining consistency and compatibility with the cloud provider''s changes or updates.'
