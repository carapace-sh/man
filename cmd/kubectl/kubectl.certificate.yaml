        [AI] `kubectl certificate` is not a standalone command in Kubernetes, but rather a sub-command under the `kubectl config` category. It is used to manage and configure client certificates for communicating with the Kubernetes API server securely using TLS (Transport Layer Security).

        The main functions of this command include:

        1. Creating new client certificates and key pairs: `kubectl create clusterrolebinding <role> --clusterrole=<cluster-role> --serviceaccount=<namespace>:<service-account>`. This command generates a new client certificate for the specified service account.
        2. Configuring contexts to use specific client certificates: `kubectl config set contexts.<context>.client-certificate <file>`. This command sets the client certificate file path for the given Kubernetes context.
        3. Displaying information about existing client certificates: `kubectl config view --minify | grep client-certificate`. This command shows the details of all client certificates configured in your current kubeconfig.

        For more information on using the `kubectl certificate` sub-command, refer to the official Kubernetes documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-root/kubectl/config/#certificate-management.
