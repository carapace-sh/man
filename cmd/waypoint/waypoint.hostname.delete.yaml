            [AI] The `flag "waypoint hostname delete --workspace"` is used with Waypoint, a Hashicorp tool for managing and deploying applications. This specific command deletes a named host from a specified Waypoint workspace.

            When you use the `hostname delete` sub-command, you provide the name of the host that you want to delete as an argument.
