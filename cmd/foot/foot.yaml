documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `foot` command is not a standard command in Unix or Linux systems. It seems to be undefined and does not exist by default. You may be mistaking it for other commands with similar names, such as `ftp` (File Transfer Protocol), `fdisk` (disk partitioning), or `printf` with a typo (Print Formatted). Please double-check the command name for accurate information.'
    flag:
        app-id: '[AI] The `--flag "foot --app-id"` is a command line argument used with some applications, particularly those built using Node.js and Express.js framework. This specific flag is used to set an application ID or API key for communication between different services or systems. In simpler terms, it allows passing an identifier that helps in authenticating and authorizing access to certain functionalities or resources.'
        check-config: '[AI] The `--check-config` flag is a command-line option used with Composer, a dependency management tool for PHP projects. When the `foot` command (an alias or script wrapper around Composer) is run with this flag, it performs a check of the current project''s Composer configuration files (lock file and `composer.json`) to verify their syntax and integrity without making any changes. It helps in identifying potential issues before running actual installation or update processes.'
        config: '[AI] The `--config` option under the `foot` command in Unix-based systems is used to specify a custom configuration file for the `foot` command. The `foot` command is typically used to format and filter text streams, such as displaying tabular data or marking up text with HTML or other formatting languages. By providing a configuration file, users can define custom formatting rules, filters, and other options that are specific to their use case. This allows for more flexibility and easier management of complex formatting tasks.'
        e: '[AI] The `-e` flag for the `foot` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to specify a script or program to be applied to each input file. This script, usually written in a language like Awk or Shell, is executed with each file as its standard input. The result of this processing becomes the output for that file when using `foot` for tabulating and reporting on text files.'
        font: |-
            [AI] The `--flag "foot --font"` is a command-line option used in various programs, typically those related to text formatting or processing. This option sets two sub-options: `foot` and `--font`.

            `foot` likely refers to the position of the footer in a document. For instance, in a PDF file created using LaTeX with the `pdfpages` package, `\includepdf[pagecommand={{\footnotesize Footer text}}]{filename}` sets the footer text. In the context of this flag, it probably means that the following value or command relates to the footer.

            The `--font` option specifies the font to be used in the document or application. It can take a font family name (e.g., "Arial", "Helvetica", or "Times New Roman") or a font path and file name. When using this flag, you're usually indicating that the following value is the desired font for text within the scope of the footer.
        fullscreen: '[AI] The `--fullscreen` flag for a command or application typically causes it to occupy the entirety of the terminal or display screen when run. The `foot` part of the command does not appear to be relevant in this context as there seems to be no known command or tool named "foot" with such an option.'
        hold: '[AI] The `--flag` option with the name `foot --hold` is typically used in command-line interfaces for various applications and tools. The specific meaning of this flag can vary depending on the context, as it''s up to the developers to define what actions it takes. In general, `--hold` or `--force-hold` flags are used to enforce or lock a state or action. For example, in a version control system like Git, using the command `git checkout -- <file> -- <commit> -- <branch> --no-commit --force-with-lease --quiet --strategy-option=theirs -- <path> -- foot --hold` with the `foot --hold` flag might cause the checkout to hold or pause if there''s a conflict, ensuring that you''re aware of potential issues before continuing. Always refer to the documentation provided by the tool or application for accurate information on what this specific flag does.'
        log-colorize: '[AI] The `--flag` option with the argument `foot --log-colorize` is used in the `ftp` command-line tool, specifically in its GNU version, to enable colored output in the logs produced by `ftp`. Colored logs make it easier to distinguish between different types of messages in the log file, such as error messages, informational messages, and progress indicators.'
        log-level: '[AI] The `--flag` option with the argument `"foot --log-level"` is used to configure the log level in the FOOT (Flexible Object-Oriented Toolkit) library. The log level determines the severity of messages that will be logged. Higher log levels include more detailed information, while lower log levels filter out less important messages. Commonly used log levels are: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, and `FATAL`. Setting `--log-level` to a specific level ensures that only logs with that level or higher will be displayed.'
        log-no-syslog: |-
            [AI] The `--flag` you provided, specifically `foot --log-no-syslog`, is a command-line argument for the FOOT (Forensic Open Toolschest) data parser and extractor tool.

            This flag instructs FOOT not to use the system logging facility when it runs. In other words, FOOT will not write logs to `/var/log` or any other standard system log files. Instead, FOOT will only produce output in its standard output stream (STDOUT) or in a file specified by the user.

            Therefore, using `--log-no-syslog` can be useful when running FOOT in environments where logging is restricted or when you want to keep your logs separate from system logs for privacy or organizational reasons.
        login-shell: '[AI] The `--login-shell` flag is an option for the `ssh` (Secure Shell) `connect` command. When used, it requests that an interactive shell session be started as a login shell. A login shell is a shell session that starts with a clean environment and initializes user-specific settings, such as environment variables and shell scripts located in the home directory''s `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile` files (for Bash shell) or equivalent files for other shells like zsh, tcsh, etc. This flag is typically used when logging into a remote system interactively to ensure consistent and desired environment settings throughout your session.'
        maximized: '[AI] The `--maximized` flag for the `foot` command in a Unix-like operating system is used to open the output of the command in a maximized terminal window. When you run `foot --file file.txt --maximized`, it opens the content of the given file (assumed to be a tabular data) in a terminal window that occupies the entire vertical and horizontal space of the terminal, providing an optimal viewing experience for large tables or spreadsheets.'
        override: '[AI] The `--footer` flag in various command-line tools is used to specify custom output that appears at the end of each line or record. The `--override` modifier with this flag means that any existing footer is replaced with the new one provided. For instance, in a text processing tool like `awk`, using `--footer="new_text" --override` would replace any current footer with "new\_text".'
        print-pid: '[AI] The `--print-pid` flag is an option used with the `ftp` or `sftp` command in Unix-based systems for transferring files between local and remote servers. When this flag is included in the command, it causes the PID (Process ID) of the FTP/SFTP process to be printed out upon successful connection to the server. This can be useful for troubleshooting or for easily identifying the process if it needs to be terminated. The complete command would look like `ftp -i <server> --user <username> --password <password> --print-pid`.'
        server: '[AI] The `--flag foot server` is not a standard command or flag in various programming languages, operating systems, or tools. It appears to be specific to a particular software or tool named "foot." This flag is likely used to configure foot as an HTTP or FTP server, allowing it to serve files or content to other applications or clients over the network. The exact functionality and arguments may vary depending on the implementation of foot. Consult its documentation for more details.'
        term: |-
            [AI] The `--flag` option is not a standard flag for the `foot` command in Unix-like operating systems, as `foot` is typically used to filter and format text tables. The `--term` flag is a common option for other Unix commands like `sed` or `awk`, which are used for text processing. It specifies the terminal type for interpreting escape sequences correctly when dealing with terminal output.

            When using `foot`, if you need to pass such an option, it would typically be passed as an environment variable (e.g., `export TERM=vt100`), not as a command-line flag. However, the exact usage may depend on your specific `foot` implementation or use case. For more information, consult the documentation of your `foot` installation or contact its maintainers.
        title: '[AI] The `--flag` option is a command-line argument used in various applications and scripts. When followed by the string `"foot --title"`, it indicates that an optional argument named `--title` should be passed to the `foot` command. This flag is usually used to provide additional information or settings to the `foot` command, specifically related to a title. The exact meaning and usage of this flag depend on the specific context in which it''s used.'
        version: '[AI] The `--version` option used with the `foot` command in a Unix-like operating system is employed to display the version number of the installed `foot` utility. When you run `foot --version` in your terminal, it will print out the specific version of `foot` that is currently active in your system, along with some additional information such as the compilation date and other relevant details. This can help you verify which version of the command-line tool is being used for any tasks or scripts that depend on a particular `foot` implementation.'
        window-size-chars: '[AI] The `--flag-foot --window-size-chars` is a command-line option used in various Unix-like tools, such as `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`. It sets the width of the text terminal''s reporting region or pager window to the specified number of characters. In other words, it controls how much output is displayed on the screen at once. For instance, if you use this option with `less` command, it will control how many columns of text are shown in each page. This can be useful for dealing with wide lines or long outputs and to customize the display based on the terminal size.'
        window-size-pixels: '[AI] The `--flag foot --window-size-pixels` is a command-line option for tools like `ftp`, `ssh`, or `scp`. It sets the size of the terminal window''s feet (the number of rows showing below the active session), and pixels (width) for text output. For example, `--flag foot -30x80` sets a 30-row high and 80-column wide terminal window, improving readability and session management within the terminal application.'
        working-directory: '[AI] The `--flag foot --working-directory` is a command line option for Git, a version control system. This flag is used to specify or print the current working directory of your Git repository. When you run the command with this flag, such as `git status --foot-stamp`, it will display the name of the current working directory along with the Git status output. This can be helpful in identifying which directory''s changes are being viewed within a Git repository.'
