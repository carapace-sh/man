description: Compile Dart to a kernel snapshot
flags:
    --verbosity=: Sets the verbosity level of the compilation.
    -h, --help: Print this usage information.
    -o, --output=: Write the output to <file name>.

    command: '[AI] The `dart compile kernel` command is used in Dart programming language to generate a new Flutter or Dart VM kernel binary file from the source code. This compilation process is typically required for developing and testing custom Dart-based applications on embedded devices or other platforms where the standard Dart Virtual Machine (VM) may not be available. By generating a customized kernel, developers can tailor the runtime environment to their specific hardware requirements. Note that this command assumes that the necessary build tools are properly installed in your development environment.'
    flag:
        help: |-
            [AI] `dart compile kernel --help` is a command used in Dart programming language for generating a Dart-to-Native (Dart2Native) compiled kernel. The "--help" option displays detailed information about this specific Dart2Native subcommand.

            Here's a brief explanation of the flags and their functionality:

            - `dart`: This is the Dart command-line interface used to execute various tasks, including compiling code with Dart2Native.
            - `compile`: This is the specific command for compiling Dart code using Dart2Native.
            - `kernel`: This flag instructs Dart2Native to compile a Dart kernel - a specialized type of Dart application that can run in Flutter or Fuchsia without an attached user interface (UI).
            - `--help`: This flag displays the command's usage and available options, along with brief descriptions for each one. In this case, it provides help information on how to use `dart compile kernel`.
        output: '[AI] `dart compile kernel --output` is a command used in Dart programming language to build and generate a new Flutter or Dart VM kernel from the source code. The `dart compile` is a tool that comes with the Dart SDK, and this specific command builds and outputs the result as a new kernel file (specified by `--output`) which can be loaded into a Dart or Flutter project to enable improved performance and functionality. This command is typically used for developing custom tools and applications requiring advanced features not available in the default kernels.'
        verbosity: |-
            [AI] The `dart compile` command is used to transpile Dart code into JavaScript for execution in a web browser or other environments that don't support native Dart execution. The `kernel` subcommand is specifically used to generate a Dart-to-JavaScript (dart2js) compilation artifact called a kernel.

            The `--verbosity` flag is an option that controls the amount of detail output during the compile process. With increased verbosity, Dart will print more information about each step in the compile process, allowing for greater insight into what the compiler is doing and potentially helping to diagnose any issues. The default level of verbosity is `normal`, but other options include `info` (less than normal), `warning` (more than normal but less than error), and `error` (only shows errors). By using `--verbosity=verbose` or higher levels, you'll get more detailed output to help understand the compilation process better.
