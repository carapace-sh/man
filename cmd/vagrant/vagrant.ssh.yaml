description: connects to machine via SSH
flags:
    --no-tty: Disables tty when executing an ssh command (defaults to true)

    -p, --plain: Plain mode, leaves authentication up to user
    -t, --tty: Enables tty when executing an ssh command (defaults to true)
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant ssh` command is used to establish an SSH connection from your local machine to a Vagrant-managed virtual machine. This allows you to securely access and manage the virtual machine as if you were physically sitting in front of it. It assumes that you have properly configured Vagrantfile with valid SSH keys for authentication, and that the virtual machine is running.'
    flag:
        command: '[AI] `vagrant ssh --command` is a Vagrant command used to execute a specific command on a connected Vagrant machine via SSH. The `--command` option follows the `ssh` subcommand, and the command to be executed is provided as an argument after it. For example, `vagrant ssh --command="ls -la /var/www"` would connect to the Vagrant machine via SSH and execute the given `ls` command with the specified options in the `/var/www` directory.'
        no-tty: '[AI] The `vagrant ssh --no-tty` command is used to establish an SSH connection to a Vagrant virtual machine without opening a terminal window for interactive input. The `--no-tty` flag tells Vagrant not to allocate a TTY (Teletype) device for the session, allowing it to run in the background or in non-interactive modes. This can be useful for automating tasks or running scripts on the remote machine.'
        plain: '[AI] `vagrant ssh --plain` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machines. This command establishes an SSH connection to the default provisioner target (usually the primary server in a Vagrant setup) using raw, unencrypted data instead of wrapping it in an SSH protocol session. The `--plain` option is used to bypass standard SSH authentication and encryption for advanced use cases like scripting or automating tasks where raw access is required.'
        tty: '[AI] `vagrant ssh --tty` is a command used with Vagrant, a tool for managing virtual machines and development environments. The `ssh` part of the command invokes Secure Shell (SSH) connection to access the guest machine running in the VirtualBox or other provider, while `--tty` option requests an interactive TTY (Text-based User Interface) session instead of a dumb terminal. This allows for a more interactive experience when working on the remote machine from your local environment within Vagrant.'
