documentation:
    command: '[AI] `glab release upload` is a GitLab CLI command used to create and upload a new GitLab Release from the local filesystem or a tarball/zipfile. It requires authentication and access to the specific GitLab project. The command takes the release notes as an argument and creates a draft release, allowing for editing before it''s published. Once edited, you can use `glab release publish <release-id>` to publish the release.'
    flag:
        assets-links: '[AI] The `glab release upload` command is a GitLab CI/CD tool provided by glab, a GitLab CLI client. The `--assets-links` option is used to include asset links in the release notes when uploading a new release. Assets links are URLs that point to files or resources outside of the repository, which can be included in the release description for easy access by users. This can be useful for large binary files like images, videos, or executables, as they don''t need to be included directly in the repository, reducing storage and build time.'
