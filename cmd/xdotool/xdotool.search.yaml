    command: '[AI] `xdotool search` is a command-line utility for interacting with the X Window System using the xdotool tool. The "search" function allows you to find and get information about windows based on various criteria, such as their name, class, or ID. When used without any arguments, it lists all currently open windows in hierarchical order. To search for a specific window, use `xdotool search --name <window_name>` or `xdotool search --class <window_class>`. This command returns a list of window handles that can be used with other xdotool commands to manipulate the targeted windows.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `xdotool search --all` is a command used with the xdotool tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical environment programmatically. The `search` subcommand searches for windows based on given criteria and returns their identifiers (window IDs). The `--all` option tells xdotool to search for all windows matching the default criteria, which includes all focused, visible, and matched-by-name or -class windows. In practical use, this command can be used to automate interactions with multiple windows by passing their returned IDs as arguments to other xdotool commands.'
        any: '[AI] `xdotool` is a powerful automated GUI interaction tool for X11-based systems. The command `xdotool search --any` is used to find and return the window IDs of all windows matching a given criterion. The option `--any` tells xdotool to perform a case-insensitive substring match against the window titles or classes. For example, if you run `xdotool search --name "Calculator" --any`, it will return the IDs of all windows with the title containing the string "Calculator", regardless of the exact match.'
        class: '[AI] `xdotool search --class` is a command-line utility used in Linux and Unix systems for interacting with the graphical user interface (GUI) programmatically. The `search` subcommand of xdotool searches for windows based on given criteria, specifically by their window class name. So, `xdotool search --class <window_class>` will return a list of window handles for all open windows with the specified class name. This can be useful for automating tasks that involve interacting with specific GUI applications or components.'
        classname: '[AI] `xdotool search --classname` is a command-line tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical user interface (GUI). This specific usage searches for windows based on their class name. When you run this command, xdotool returns a list of window IDs associated with the windows having the specified class name. For instance, if you want to find a Firefox browser window, you could use `xdotool search --classname "Mozilla Firefox"`. This command helps in automating interactions with specific GUI elements or applications.'
        desktop: '[AI] `xdotool search --desktop` is a command used in the xdotool toolkit for interacting with the X Window System graphical interface programmatically. The `search` sub-command searches for windows based on certain criteria. In this specific case, `--desktop` specifies that the search should be limited to windows on the currently focused desktop. The output is a list of window identifiers (IDs) corresponding to the matching windows. This command can be used in shell scripts or other automation workflows for controlling and manipulating X11 application windows.'
        limit: |-
            [AI] `xdotool` is a system tool for interacting with X11 applications in a programmatic way. The `search` command in `xdotool` allows finding and targeting specific windows based on their names or classes.

            The option `--limit N` sets the maximum number of matches returned by the search command to `N`. By default, it returns all matching windows. Limiting the number of results can help improve performance and reduce potential errors when working with large numbers of windows.
        maxdepth: |-
            [AI] `xdotool search --maxdepth` is a command used in the xdotool utility, which is a powerful tool for automating and interacting with the X Window System graphical user interface. The `search` subcommand allows you to find and target specific windows based on various criteria.

            The `--maxdepth` option sets the maximum search depth for window matching. It takes an integer value that specifies how many levels deep in the hierarchical window tree to traverse when searching for matches. By default, `xdotool search` searches the entire desktop including all nested windows. Setting a smaller number will limit the search to fewer levels of hierarchy, potentially speeding up the search and reducing false positives. However, lowering the depth may also miss some matching windows if they are deeply nested within other windows.
        name: '[AI] `xdotool search --name` is a command-line utility used in Linux and other Unix-like systems to interact with the graphical user interface (GUI) via the X Window System protocol. The specific command `xdotool search --name <window_name>` searches for and returns the window IDs of open windows that match the given `<window_name>`. This can be useful for automating tasks or writing scripts to manipulate or interact with specific GUI applications.'
        onlyvisible: '[AI] `xdotool search --onlyvisible` is a command-line utility used in Linux and Unix systems to interact with the graphical user interface (GUI) through the X11 Window System. This specific command searches for and returns a list of only the currently visible (i.e., unfocused but not minimized or hidden) window handles based on a given search criteria, such as a window name or class. This command is often used in scripts to automate GUI interactions with specific applications without having to deal with all other windows.'
        pid: '[AI] `xdotool search --pid` is a command used in the xdotool tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical environment programmatically. The `search` sub-command searches for windows based on specific criteria, and the `--pid` option specifies that the search should be based on the Process ID (PID) of the process associated with a window. So, using `xdotool search --pid <PID>` will return information about the window or windows controlled by that process.'
        role: '[AI] `xdotool search --role` is a command-line utility used in Linux environments for interacting with the graphical user interface (GUI) programmatically. This specific command searches the entire desktop hierarchy for windows that have a particular role, which can be specified as an argument to the `--role` option. The results of this search are returned as identifiers or handles, which can then be used with other xdotool commands to manipulate these windows. For instance, you could use it in scripts to automate actions on specific applications based on their role.'
        screen: '[AI] The `xdotool` command with the argument `search --screen` is used to find and identify X11 windows based on their properties, such as title, class name, or ID. The option `--screen` specifies that the search should be performed on all connected monitors or screens. When you run this command in a terminal, it returns a list of window identifiers (also known as window ids or WIDs) for the matching windows. This information can then be used with other `xdotool` commands to interact with those windows, such as sending input events or moving and resizing them.'
        sync: '[AI] `xdotool search --sync` is a command used in the xdotool tool for interacting with the X11 window system programmatically. The `search` subcommand searches for windows based on certain criteria, and the `--sync` option ensures that the command waits for each matching window to be found before continuing. This can be useful when dealing with dynamic or complex window configurations where synchronous searching is required for accurate results.'
