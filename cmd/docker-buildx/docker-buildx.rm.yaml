    -f, --force: Do not prompt for confirmation
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker buildx rm` is a command used with Docker Buildx, an extension of Docker that adds support for building multi-stage images using multiple buildx workers. The `rm` command is used to remove a buildx worker node from the pool of available workers. When you run `docker buildx rm <worker>`, you''re instructing Docker to delete the specified worker, which may involve removing associated container(s) and network resources as well. Please note that this action will stop the worker and all associated builds will be interrupted.'
    flag:
        all-inactive: '[AI] `docker buildx rm --all-inactive` is a command used with Docker Buildx, an extension of Docker that adds support for building multi-stage builds and other advanced features using multiple buildx contexts. The command removes all inactive buildx contexts, which are contexts that have not been used recently or explicitly selected. This helps to keep the list of buildx contexts manageable and efficient.'
        force: '[AI] `docker buildx rm --force` is a command used in Docker Buildx, an extension of Docker that adds support for building multi-context images using multiple buildx contexts. The command `rm --force` is used to remove a buildx context permanently. When the `--force` flag is provided, the command will delete the context without asking for confirmation. If you want to delete a buildx context but are not sure and would like to be prompted before proceeding, omit the `--force` flag.'
        keep-daemon: '[AI] `docker buildx` is a Docker extension for building multistage images using multiple contexts and caches. The command `docker-buildx rm --keep-daemon` removes all the build contexts configured under `docker buildx` but keeps the daemon running. This means that any previously created build contexts will be deleted, but the background `docker buildx` daemon process will continue to run, enabling you to create new build contexts in the future.'
        keep-state: '[AI] `docker buildx rm --keep-state` is a command used with Docker Buildx, an extension of Docker that enables building containers from multiple sources including files, Git repositories, and remote URLs. This command removes a specific Builder context or worker node from the Buildx environment while keeping its state data to allow for future reuse. This means that the builder itself is removed, but any images or configurations associated with it are preserved.'
