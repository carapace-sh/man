description: Stop a process
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `supervisorctl` is a command-line interface for managing Supervisor, a process monitoring tool in system administration. The `stop` command is used to gracefully terminate one or more processes being managed by Supervisor. When you run `supervisorctl stop <process_name>`, the specified process will be signaled to shut down in an orderly fashion, giving it a chance to save any necessary data before termination. This is generally preferred over using forceful methods like killing the process directly as it can help prevent data loss or other unintended consequences.'
