documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `jj describe` command is used in Jupyter Notebook to display detailed metadata about a specific notebook cell or an entire notebook. It shows information such as the cell type, source code, output, and any attached tags or marks. When run without specifying a particular cell number, it describes the entire notebook.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `jj describe --help` is a command used in the Jupyter Notebook interactive development environment. This command displays help information about the `describe` subcommand of the `jj` tool. The `describe` command provides statistics and other summary information about the dataframe or series in Jupyter Notebook cells, making it easier to understand their contents. The `--help` option shows a detailed explanation of how to use this command, including any available options or arguments.'
        message: '[AI] The command `jj describe --message` is used in Jira, a popular project management tool, to update or create a new description for an issue. The "--message" option allows you to specify the text of the description. In essence, it enables you to provide detailed information about an issue, making it easier for team members to understand and work on it.'
        no-edit: '[AI] `jj describe --no-edit` is a command in the Jupyter JavaScript Notebook interface (Jupyter Notebook for short, or just Jupyter when using the JavaScript version). The `describe` subcommand provides details about a specific notebook cell or a range of cells. When used with the `--no-edit` flag, it prevents the editor from opening after displaying the description of the selected cells. This means you can view the description without having to edit the cells if you don''t intend to make any changes.'
        reset-author: '[AI] `jj describe --reset-author` is a Git command using the Jira Jira Software Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, `jj`. This command resets the author and committer information of the most recent commit in the current branch to match the latest associated Jira issue. The effect is that the last commit will be rewritten with a new author and committer name equal to the email and name configured for the currently authenticated user in Jira. It''s important to note that this operation can be risky, as it changes the commit history, so use it carefully and consider creating a backup before executing.'
        stdin: '[AI] The command `jj describe --stdin` is used in Jupyter-JavaScript (JupyterJS), a project that aims to create a Jupyter notebook implementation in JavaScript. This specific command is not a flag for describing a file or a cell, but rather it''s a command to start an interactive description mode when piping input through the standard input stream (`--stdin`). In this context, the `jj describe` command allows users to interactively describe Jupyter Notebook cells in a terminal or command-line interface.'
