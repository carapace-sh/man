    command: '[AI] `tmux list-panes` is a TMUX command used to display a list of all the panes currently existent in all the sessions. Each line in the output represents a pane, with columns indicating the session name, pane index, and window index. This command provides useful information for managing multiple panes within TMUX sessions.'
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `tmux list-panes` is a tmux command used to list information about current panes in a tmux session. The `-F` option allows customizing the output format using a string template. Specifically, `tmux list-panes -F ''{"pane_id": "%I", "window_id": "%W", "session_name": "%n"}''` will display pane ID (%I), window ID (%W), and session name (%n) for each pane.'
        a: '[AI] `tmux list-panes -a` is a TMUX command that lists all panes in all windows of the current session. The `-a` option makes tmux list all panes, including hidden ones. Each pane is represented by a line in the output, displaying its window ID, pane index, and other attributes like height, width, and exit status. This command is useful for getting an overview of your TMUX session layout or for scripting purposes.'
        f: '[AI] `tmux list-panes -f` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to display detailed information about the current panes (split areas) within the Tmux sessions. The `-f` option stands for "full-pane format", which means that each pane''s output will include its index, size (width and height), and the command currently running in it, if any. This command is often used to programmatically inspect or manipulate panes within a Tmux session from scripts or interactive use with tools like `xargs` or `awk`.'
        s: '[AI] `tmux list-panes -s` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, which returns a zero-terminated list of pane identifiers for all panes in the current session. The `-s` option specifies that only the session identifier and pane identifiers should be displayed, with no other information.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux list-panes -t` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to display the names or numbers of all panes (split areas) in the current session. The `-t` option tells Tmux to print the pane labels or indices instead of the default detailed output. This command provides a quick overview of the layout of the current Tmux session and can be useful for identifying and referencing specific panes.'
