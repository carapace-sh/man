    command: '[AI] `tmux show-buffer` is a TMUX command used to display the contents of a specific buffer or window in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. When you have multiple windows or sessions running, this command allows you to view the content of a particular buffer without switching to it directly, providing an efficient way to monitor and work with multiple tasks simultaneously.'
    flag:
        b: '[AI] `tmux show-buffer -b` is a command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, used to display the contents of an attached buffer in a new pane or window. The `-b` flag specifies that only the buffer''s content should be displayed, without attaching it to a session or creating a new window. This command is particularly useful when quickly checking the content of a detached process or a previously used command without interfering with the current session setup.'
