documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul members` command is used in Consul, a distributed, highly available, and data center aware toolchain for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command returns information about the members of a Consul datacenter or cluster. It provides details such as the node ID, address, status, and join method of each member. The output helps in understanding the current state of the Consul deployment and identifying any potential issues.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] The `--ca-file` flag in Consul membership commands is used to specify a file containing the CA (Certificate Authority) certificates that Consul should trust when joining or managing a cluster. This ensures that only certificates issued by trusted CAs are accepted, maintaining security and avoiding potential man-in-the-middle attacks.'
        ca-path: '[AI] The `--ca-path` flag in Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool by Hashicorp, specifies the location of a CA (Certificate Authority) bundle or directory. This bundle is used to verify the certificates presented by Consul servers during secure communication between different components of a Consul cluster or client applications communicating with these servers. By default, Consul uses its built-in self-signed certificates for local development and testing scenarios. However, for production deployments, it''s essential to use trusted CA certificates for secure communications. The `--ca-path` flag enables specifying a custom CA bundle or directory containing the trusted CA certificates.'
        client-cert: '[AI] The `--client-cert` flag in Consul''s CLI (Command Line Interface) is used to specify a file path for a client TLS certificate when configuring an agent or other Consul tool. This flag ensures secure communication between the client and Consul server by requiring the client to present a valid TLS certificate during connection.'
        client-key: '[AI] The `--client-key` option in Consul''s member flags is used to specify a client certificate or key file for secure communication between Consul agents during cluster formation. This option ensures that only authorized agents can join the Consul cluster and access its services, enhancing security and maintaining the integrity of the cluster.'
        detailed: |-
            [AI] The `consul members --detailed` command is used in Consul, a Connect and Service Mesh platform by Hashicorp. This command returns a detailed output of all members in the Consul service discovery and configuration system.

            The output includes:

            * Member ID and name
            * Address and datacenter
            * Status (alive or dead)
            * Server status (server, client, or follower)
            * Join method
            * ACL token (if set)
            * Health checks and their status
            * Roles (if assigned)

            This command is helpful for debugging issues with Consul members, monitoring the Consul cluster health, or identifying specific nodes based on different attributes.
        http-addr: '[AI] The `--http-addr` flag in Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool from Hashicorp, specifies the address on which the Consul server or agent listens for HTTP requests. This flag is used during Consul installation or configuration to set the interface and port number for accessing the Consul API. For instance, `--http-addr 192.168.0.5:8500` sets the address to `192.168.0.5` and the port to `8500`. This allows other services and clients to communicate with the Consul server or agent through this API endpoint.'
        segment: '[AI] The `--segment` flag is a parameter used in Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool from Hashicorp. When using the Consul CLI (Command Line Interface) to list or manipulate segments, the `--segment` flag specifies the name of the segment for which the operation should be performed. Segments are logical partitions within an agent''s service registration, providing a way to organize and manage services based on different environments, teams, or projects.'
        status: '[AI] The `consul members --status` command is used to display the current membership and health status of all Consul agents in a Consul cluster. Consul is a service discovery and configuration management tool. This command provides real-time information on which agents are currently alive, their roles (server or client), and whether they are healthy or not. It helps ensure the integrity and availability of services within the Consul ecosystem.'
        tls-server-name: '[AI] The `--tls-server-name` flag in Consul membership commands is used to specify a custom TLS server name during the registration of an agent with the Consul service discovery platform. It helps ensure that the agent''s client certificate verifies against the expected TLS server name when communicating over secure channels, enhancing security and preventing potential man-in-the-middle attacks.'
        token: '[AI] The `--token` option in the Consul CLI command `flag members` is used to specify an HTTP authentication token for secure access to the Consul API. This token allows Consul to authenticate and authorize requests, ensuring that only authorized users have access to view or modify cluster information, such as the list of members and their statuses.'
        token-file: '[AI] The `--token-file` flag is used with Consul''s membership command. It specifies a file from which to read an ACL (Access Control List) token for authenticating requests to the Consul API or RPC interface. This token is required when interacting with Consul as a member of a Consul cluster, allowing fine-grained access control over different parts of the Consul configuration and data.'
        wan: '[AI] The `--wan` flag in Consul''s `members` command is used to join a Consul server or agent to a WAN (Wide Area Network) data center in Consul''s distributed hash key ring. By using this flag, the member will be registered with the specified WAN data center instead of the local one, allowing for cross-datacenter communication and service discovery across multiple sites connected by a WAN. This is useful for organizations with multi-site deployments or those using Consul to manage services spanning geographically dispersed infrastructure.'
