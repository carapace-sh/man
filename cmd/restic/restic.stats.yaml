        host: '[AI] `restic stats --host` is a command used with the backup tool, `restic`. This command displays statistics for backups stored on a specific host or server, identified by its address or name provided after the `--host` flag.

This command helps users monitor their backup data and assess their backup usage efficiently.'
        mode: '[AI] The `restic stats` command is used in the data backup tool, `restic`, to display statistics about the backups. The `--mode` option can be used to specify the type of statistics to display. There are three modes: "summary", which shows an overview of all repositories and their sizes; "detail", which displays detailed information for each repository; and "tree", which shows a tree view of the backup data organized by file paths. So, `restic stats --mode summary` will give you a summary of all repositories, while `restic stats --mode detail` will display detailed statistics for each one, and `restic stats --mode tree` will show the data in a tree format.'
        path: '[AI] `restic stats --path` is a command used in the data backup tool, `restic`. This command displays statistics about backups stored under a specific path. The `--path` option specifies the directory or file path to query for backup statistics. It provides details such as the number of files and bytes backed up, the latest checkpoint timestamp, and the total retention time for the backups in that path.'
        tag: '[AI] The `restic stats --tag` command is used in the data backup and sync tool, `restic`. This command generates statistics about the backed up data tagged with a specific label or tag. The output shows the number of files, size, and unique size of each tag, providing an overview of the data organized by tags.'
