documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `newrelic nerdstorage document write` command is used to write data into New Relic''s NerdStorage, which is a data store for storing and retrieving custom metadata and configuration settings for New Relic instruments. This command allows users to persistently store and retrieve large amounts of data that can be used to extend the functionality of New Relic''s monitoring and performance analysis tools. The syntax typically involves specifying a bucket name, document key, and the data to be written in JSON format. For example: `newrelic nerdstorage document write mybucket mykey ''{"field1":"value1","field2":"value2"}''`'
    flag:
        collection: |-
            [AI] The `newrelic nerdstorage document write --collection` command is used in New Relic's Nerdgraph query language to insert or update a document within a specific collection in NerdStorage, New Relic's data store. The syntax includes the `document write` verb followed by the name of the collection and the data to be stored in JSON format enclosed within curly braces `{}`. For example:

            ```bash
            newrelic nerdstorage document write --collection my_collection '{"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"}'
            ```

            This command will insert or update a document with the keys `key1` and `key2` in the collection named `my_collection`, with the corresponding values `value1` and `value2`.
        document: '[AI] The `newrelic nerdstorage document write --document` command is used in New Relic''s Nerdgraph query language to write a new document or update an existing one in Nerdstorage, which is New Relic''s internal data store. The flag `--document` specifies that the following argument is the name of the document to be written or updated. This command does not retrieve or read documents; it only modifies them.'
        documentId: '[AI] The `newrelic nerdstorage document write --documentId` command is used to write or update a specific document in New Relic''s NerdStorage, which is a data store for storing and retrieving custom metadata. The `--documentId` option specifies the unique identifier of the document to be written or updated. When executed, the command sends the new data to NerdStorage, replacing any existing information associated with the given document ID.'
        entityGuid: '[AI] The `newrelic nerdstorage document write --entityGuid` command is used in the New Relic Data Platform to write a new document or update an existing one with a specific Entity Guid. "NerdStorage" is New Relic''s proprietary data store, and this command allows you to interact with it using the New Relic CLI (Command Line Interface). The `document write` action writes or updates a document with the specified `--entityGuid`.'
        packageId: '[AI] The `newrelic nerdstorage document write` command is used to write data into New Relic''s Nerdgraph data store, also known as NerdStorage, with New Relic''s Performance API or Insights Platform. The `--packageId` flag refers to the identifier of the package that contains the instrumentation and configuration for writing the specific data. It ensures that the data is associated with the correct application and instrumentation in New Relic.'
        scope: '[AI] The `newrelic nerdstorage document write --scope` command is used in New Relic''s Nerdgraph query language to write a document into New Relic''s NerdStorage data store. The `--scope` option specifies the scope or namespace under which the document will be written. This command does not read or retrieve documents, but only writes new ones based on the provided data.'
