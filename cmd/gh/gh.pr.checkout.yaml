documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh pr checkout` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to check out a specific branch or pull request in your local repository. It fetches and switches to the specified branch or pull request, allowing you to make changes, commit them, and create a new pull request if needed. Keep in mind that using this command will overwrite any local changes in your current branch, so it''s essential to ensure you have committed or stashed any work beforehand.'
    flag:
        branch: '[AI] The `gh pr checkout --branch` command is used with GitHub''s `gh` CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool to check out a specific branch of a repository directly into a new detached HEAD state, while keeping the current branch as the upstream tracking branch. This command is typically used when working on a pull request (PR), allowing you to make and test changes in an isolated environment without affecting your local or remote branches until you''re ready to merge the changes back into the target branch.'
        detach: |-
            [AI] `gh pr checkout --detach` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to check out a specific branch or commit in detached HEAD mode. This means that you'll no longer be on the branch associated with your current pull request, but instead directly on the specified commit or branch tip.

            The main use case for this command is to make changes directly on the branch that a pull request targets without creating a new branch locally, or to create and apply patch files to the branch in question. Once finished, you can then create a new pull request with these changes using GitHub's web interface.
        force: '[AI] `gh pr checkout --force` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to force-checkout a specific branch or commit associated with a Pull Request (PR). This command overrides the usual checks, allowing you to bypass conflicts and merge branches even if they have diverged significantly. Use it when you''re sure that resolving any potential conflicts manually is necessary, as it may result in data loss if used incorrectly.'
        recurse-submodules: |-
            [AI] The `gh pr checkout --recurse-submodules` command is used in GitHub's `git-hub` CLI tool to checkout a specific branch of a repository, including all submodule dependencies at their specified versions.

            Submodules are Git repositories embedded as subdirectories within another Git repository, allowing you to keep related projects under a single version control system. This command ensures that the checked-out branch includes all the required commits for the submodules as well.

            By using `--recurse-submodules` option, you'll not only checkout the main branch but also recursively update its submodule references to their corresponding committed states.
