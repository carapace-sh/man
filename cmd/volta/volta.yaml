        [AI] "Volta" is not a commonly used command in computing or technology. It seems to be a name of various things in different contexts. Here are some possible meanings:

        1. Volta is a cross-platform CLI (Command Line Interface) and IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for the Rust programming language, which helps manage workspaces, packages, and builds.
        2. Volta is an open-source, extensible web worker framework for Node.js developed by Netlify, which enables running JavaScript code in the background without interfering with the user experience of a web page.
        3. Volta is also the former name of a blockchain platform that aimed to make decentralized applications more accessible and scalable but has since rebranded as Polkadot.

        Without further context, it's difficult to determine which "volta" you are referring to. If you meant one of these definitions and need more information, please let me know!

        quiet: '[AI] The `--quiet` flag for Volta is used to suppress most output from Volta commands. It makes the command run quietly in the background without displaying informational messages or progress bars, making the terminal session less cluttered and focusing on just the result of the command execution.'
        verbose: '[AI] `volta --verbose` is a command-line option for Volta, a tool for managing JavaScript projects and their dependencies. When used, it increases the level of output provided during Volta''s operations, helping users to better understand what actions Volta is taking behind the scenes with more detailed information being displayed in the terminal.'
        version: '[AI] The `volta --version` command is used to check the current version of Volta, a framework for managing and deploying JavaScript projects, installed in your system. It returns output similar to `Volta CLI vX.Y.Z (X.Y.Z-XXX)` where X.Y.Z is the major.minor.patch version and XXX is the git commit hash.'
