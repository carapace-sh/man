documentation:
    command: '[AI] `brew bump-revision` is a Homebrew command used to increment the version number of a Formula or Cask in your local Homebrew installation. When run, it automatically detects the current repository and bumps the revision number based on the type of update (major, minor, patch) specified. For example: `brew bump-minor my-formula` would increment the minor version number. This command is useful for maintaining and updating your local Homebrew installations.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `brew bump-revision --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to increment the version number of an installed package and create a new commit with that change in the Homebrew repository. The `--debug` flag enables verbose output, providing additional information about the command''s execution for debugging purposes.'
        dry-run: '[AI] The `brew bump-revision` is a command used in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS, to increment the version number of installed packages or formulas. The `--dry-run` option is used with this command to perform a simulation or rehearsal of the changes that would be made without actually making them. In other words, it shows you what would happen if you ran the command without executing any modifications to your system.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `brew bump-revision` is a command provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to manage version pins in the Brewfile or in Packages formulae. The `--help` option provides detailed usage information when invoking this command. Here's a brief summary of the help output:

            - `brew bump-revision [formula] [--commit|--tag] [--force]`
              Bumps the specified formula to a new version.

            - `[formula]`: The Homebrew formula name, optional if in current directory.

            - `[--commit]`: Creates a new Git commit with the version change and messages from .brewer.yml or git commit message.

            - `[--tag]`: Tags the current commit instead of committing it.

            - `[--force]`: Forces a version bump even if there are unstaged changes.

            For more detailed information, you can refer to the official Homebrew documentation: https://docs.brew.sh/Command-bump-revision.
        message: '[AI] The `brew bump-revision` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to increment the version number of an installed package and commit the change with a given message. The `--message` option allows you to provide a custom message that will be included in the commit message when the revision is bumped. This command can be useful when you want to update to a new version of a package while recording the update action for future reference in your Git history.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `brew` command with the option `bump-revision --quiet` is used to update the version number of a Homebrew installed package formula. It increments the minor or patch version number based on the type specified (major, minor, or patch) and prints only the new version number without any additional output. This command is often used when managing open-source projects on macOS with Homebrew as a dependency manager.'
        remove-bottle-block: |-
            [AI] The `brew bump-revision --remove-bottle-block` command is used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to update the version of an already installed formula or cask without reinstalling it entirely. Here's a brief explanation of the components:

            1. `brew`: Homebrew is a package manager for managing software installations on macOS.
            2. `bump-revision`: This is a subcommand of Homebrew used to manage formula or cask versions. It allows incrementing or updating the version number.
            3. `--remove-bottle-block`: This option instructs Homebrew not to recreate the existing bottle (precompiled binary package) when updating the formula or cask. Instead, it updates the existing bottle if it exists, and uses the updated formula or cask recipe to rebuild it if necessary.

            In summary, `brew bump-revision --remove-bottle-block` is used to update an installed formula or cask's version without having to reinstall it entirely. It also keeps the existing bottle (precompiled binary package) if it exists and uses it to minimize the rebuild time.
        verbose: |-
            [AI] The `brew bump-revision` command is a Homebrew (a popular package manager for macOS) utility used to increment the version number of a specific formula or package in the Homebrew repository. The `--verbose` flag is an optional argument that increases the amount of output displayed during the command's execution.

            When you run `brew bump-revision <formula-name> --verbose`, it will show detailed information about each step taken during the process of incrementing the formula's revision number, such as:

            1. Fetching the latest changes in the Homebrew repository.
            2. Updating the specified formula's dependencies (if needed).
            3. Bumping the revision number according to your chosen strategy (major, minor or patch).
            4. Committing the changes to the formula's Git repository locally.
            5. Creating a tag with the new revision number.
            6. Pushing the changes and the tag to the remote Homebrew repository.

            This verbose output helps developers better understand what is happening during the process and troubleshoot any potential issues.
        write-only: '[AI] `brew bump-revision --write-only` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command bumps the version number of the currently selected Homebrew installation or formula in the local repository, without making any other changes or committing the modification to the Git repository. The `--write-only` flag ensures that only the local files are updated and not pushed to the remote repository.'
