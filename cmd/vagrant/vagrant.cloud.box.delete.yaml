        [AI] The `vagrant box delete` command is used to remove a specific Vagrant box from your local machine's VirtualBox or Hyper-V cache. It deletes the actual box files on your system, but not from the remote Vagrant Cloud repository if you obtained it there.

        The general syntax of the command is: `vagrant box delete <box_name>`

        Replace `<box_name>` with the name or URL of the box you want to delete. Be aware that this action is permanent and irreversible, so only use it when you are certain that you no longer need the box.

            [AI] `vagrant cloud box delete --force` is a Vagrant command used to permanently delete a specific virtual machine box from the Vagrant Cloud repository. When you use this command with the `--force` flag, you confirm that you want to delete the box without any confirmation prompts.

            This action cannot be undone once executed, so it should only be performed when you are certain that you no longer need the box. It's important to remember that deleting a box may affect other users who depend on it in their Vagrant projects.

            Using this command helps to maintain a clean and up-to-date list of boxes in your account, which can improve performance and security.
        no-force: '[AI] `vagrant cloud box delete --no-force` is a Vagrant command used to delete a specific virtual box image from the Hashicorp Atlas (Vagrant Cloud) repository. The `--no-force` flag is an optional argument that prevents the deletion if the box with the same name already exists in the repository, instead of overwriting it. If you want to forcefully delete a box regardless of its existence, omit this flag.'
