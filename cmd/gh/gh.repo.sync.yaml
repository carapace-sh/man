This command synchronizes the current local branch with the origin branch, merging any diverged commits or fetching new branches if they exist.

        force: '[AI] `git hub repo sync --force` is a Git command used to update a local Git repository with changes from a remote repository, specifically one hosted on GitHub. The `--force` option tells Git to overwrite any local commits that conflict with the remote commits, effectively resetting the local repository to match the remote one exactly. This can be useful when dealing with merge conflicts or keeping a local repository in sync with a remote repository that has been updated since the last pull.'

            [AI] `gh repo sync --source` is a Git command provided by the GitHub CLI (gh) tool. This command is used to update a local Git repository with the latest changes from a specific remote repository, usually your forked or upstream GitHub repository.

            The `--source` flag specifies the name of the remote repository to fetch the changes from. It assumes that you have already set up the remote repository as an origin in your local Git configuration file (e.g., `.git/config`) or added it using `git remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>`.

            In summary, this command syncs your local Git repository with the specified remote repository to keep your project up-to-date.
