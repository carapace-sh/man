    command: '[AI] `vercel secrets rename` is a command used in Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, to rename an existing environment variable secret. The syntax is as follows: `vercel -- experiment-store -- project <project-name> secrets rename <old-name> <new-name>`. This command requires the use of the Vercel CLI and the `--experiment-store` flag, which allows for managing experimental features. When executed, it will rename the secret with the given `old-name` to the new name specified by `<new-name>`.'
