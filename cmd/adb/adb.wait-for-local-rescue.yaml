        [AI] The `adb wait-for-local-rescue` command is a part of Android Debug Bridge (ADB), which is a versatile toolkit for debugging and managing Android devices. This specific command is used to wait for the local Android Recovery image to be available on an Android device before executing other ADB commands.

        When you run `adb wait-for-local-rescue`, ADB checks if the device's recovery mode is active, and it keeps trying to establish a connection with the device in that state. If the connection is successful, ADB will wait for the Android Recovery image to be accessible before passing control back to you. This command can be useful when performing advanced tasks such as flashing custom recoveries or ROMs using ADB.
