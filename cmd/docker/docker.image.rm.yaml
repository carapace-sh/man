documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker image rm` command is used to remove one or more specified Docker images from the local registry. When executed, it deletes the image manifest files stored on the system without removing any associated containers or container data. The images are permanently deleted only if they''re not in use by any containers, and their dependencies aren''t required by other images. To remove an image, specify its name and tag using the following format: `docker image rm <image-name>:<tag>`. Multiple images can be removed at once by separating their names with spaces.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The `docker image rm --force` command is used to forcefully remove a Docker image from your local system. The `--force` option overrides any content in the image that prevents it from being deleted, such as dangling layers or unused tags. If you attempt to delete an image that has containers associated with it, you will first need to stop and remove those containers before deleting the image. If no containers are using the image, then `docker image rm --force` can be used to permanently delete it from your local Docker registry.'
        no-prune: '[AI] The `docker image rm` command is used to remove one or more specified Docker images from your local Docker registry. The `--no-prune` flag is an optional argument that prevents Docker from automatically removing unused intermediate images when the specified images are deleted. With this flag, only the named images will be removed and the intermediate images that they depend on will remain on the system. Without the `--no-prune` flag, Docker will delete all unused images, including intermediate ones, to save disk space.'
