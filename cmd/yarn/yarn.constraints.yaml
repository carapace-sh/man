    command: '[AI] The `yarn constraints` command is used in Yarn, a popular JavaScript package manager, to view or manage the resolved dependencies and their constraints for a given project. Dependencies'' constraints specify exact or range versions that should be installed, ensuring consistency and preventing potential version conflicts. Running `yarn constraints` without arguments displays the current project''s dependency tree with their respective constraints. Using it with an argument like `add <dependency>@<version>` lets you add a new dependency with a specific version constraint.'
