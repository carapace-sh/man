documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker context import` is a Docker CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to import contexts, which are collections of Docker configurations like certificates, target endpoints, or authentication data, from a file or a URL into the current Docker client. This allows you to switch between different cluster environments or registries easily. The general syntax is: `docker context import <file> [<as> <context-name>]`, where `<file>` is the path to the YAML format context file and `<context-name>` (optional) is the desired name for the new context.'
