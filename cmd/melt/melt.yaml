    command: '[AI] The `melt` function in R is used to reshape data from wide format to long format, and vice versa. It is part of the `reshape2` package. In long format, each observation has a unique row, and variables are represented as columns with one level per row. Conversely, in wide format, observations are represented as rows, and variables with multiple levels for each observation are presented as separate columns. By specifying which variables to ID-collecate (keep as identifiers), and which to var-name and value, `melt` can effectively transform data between these formats.'
