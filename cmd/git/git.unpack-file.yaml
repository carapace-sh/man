documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git unpack-file` is a Git command used to extract the contents of a specific file from a previous Git commit, without checking out the entire snapshot or directory tree. This command takes two arguments: the path to the Git object database and the SHA-1 identifier of the commit, followed by the path and name of the file you want to extract. For example, `git unpack-file <object-db> <commit-sha> <path/to/extracted/file>`. It''s useful when you need to access just one file from a specific commit without fully checking it out.'
