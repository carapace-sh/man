documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `glab user events` command is used in GitLab to list all the events related to a specific user''s activity within a given GitLab project or across multiple projects. This command helps users or administrators monitor and track various actions taken by the user, such as commits, merges, tag pushes, pipeline runs, and more. It''s essential for understanding user behavior, troubleshooting issues, and enforcing security policies in GitLab environments.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `glab` is a Git interface for the cloud-native GitOps platform, Flagger. The `user events --all` command is used to list all user events recorded by Glab. These events represent various actions performed using Glab, such as creating or updating deployments, rolling back versions, and so on. This command displays all the events in a table format with columns for event type, resource name, resource namespace, timestamp, and any relevant messages associated with the event.'
        page: '[AI] `glab` is a Git interface for PowerShell and is used to interact with Git repositories using the PowerShell scripting language. The command `glab user events --page` retrieves the user events (commits, pushes, etc.) from a specific Git page, such as a GitHub or GitLab page. The `--page` option specifies the URL of the page that contains the events to be fetched. This command can be used to get the recent activity on a particular repository, branch, or commit without having to navigate to the web interface directly.'
        per-page: '[AI] The `glab` command with the option `--per-page user events` requests GitLab CLI to list user events in batches of a specified page size. This means that when you have a large number of user events, instead of returning all at once and potentially causing high memory usage or other performance issues, it will return them in smaller chunks, each one being a new page. By default, the page size is set to 30, but you can change this value using `--per-page` option.'
