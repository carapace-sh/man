documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tofu workspace delete` command is used to delete an existing Tofu data versioning workstation in the Tofu Version Control System. When issued, it permanently removes all data associated with that specific workspace, including its history and configurations. It''s important to note that this action cannot be undone, so it should only be executed after careful consideration.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The command `tofu workspace delete -force` is used to permanently delete a Tofu (a Git tool for collaborative coding) workspace, bypassing any confirmation prompts. This action cannot be undone and all files associated with the workspace will be removed from your local machine as well as from Tofu''s servers. It''s recommended to use this command only when you are absolutely sure that you want to delete the workspace.'
        lock: '[AI] The command `tofu workspace delete --lock` is used in Tufas, a Git-based data versioning system. This command deletes a specific Tofu workspace and its associated lock file. A lock file ensures that only one user can modify the data at a time to prevent conflicts. When this command is run, the workspace is deleted permanently, and any ongoing locks on the data are released.'
        lock-timeout: '[AI] The `tofu workspace delete --lock-timeout` command is used in Tofu, a Git worktree management tool, to delete an existing workspace with a locked file or directory. The `--lock-timeout` option sets the duration for which Tofu will wait before forcefully deleting the workspace if it''s still locked by another process or user. If no timeout is specified, Tofu will wait indefinitely. By providing a time value, you can set a limit to avoid waiting indefinitely and potentially resolve conflicts more efficiently.'
