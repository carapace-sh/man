    command: '[AI] `mdbook init` is a command used in Rust programming language for creating a new Mdbook project. Mdbook is a free and open-source static site generator for Markdown documents, designed to produce output in HTML, PDF, and other formats. When you run `mdbook init`, it sets up a new directory structure with the basic files needed to begin writing your book or documentation using Mdbook, such as a `Cargo.toml` file, `src` folder containing an initial Markdown file, and a `target` folder for generated output.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `mdbook init --force` is a command used with the Mdbook book generator for creating new Mdbook projects. The `--force` option is used to overwrite an existing project directory without asking for confirmation. It initializes a new Mdbook project in the specified directory with default configurations and structures.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `mdbook init` is a command used to create a new Mdbook project in Rust. When run with the `--help` flag, it provides information about how to use this command correctly. Here's a summary of the help output:

            - `mdbook init <PROJECT_NAME>`: Creates a new Mdbook project at `<PROJECT_NAME>`.
            - Supports creating projects in multiple directories.
            - Uses a default template but can be customized by providing a `--template` flag.
            - Creates a Git repository with a basic `.gitignore` file.
            - Generates a `Cargo.toml` file, which manages dependencies and build system.
            - Sets up an `mdbook.yml` configuration file for Mdbook's project settings.

            In summary, the command initializes an Mdbook project with the specified name and sets up essential files like `Cargo.toml`, `mdbook.yml`, and a basic Git repository.
        ignore: |-
            [AI] `mdbook init --ignore` is a command used with the Mdbook book builder for Markdown documents. This command initializes a new Mdbook project, but it skips the creation of certain files and directories that are typically generated during the initialization process. The `--ignore` flag allows you to specify a list of items to ignore during the initialization process.

            This can be useful if you want to create a new Mdbook project with custom configurations or if you want to exclude certain files or directories from being created. For example, you might use this command to create an empty Mdbook project without any default files or configurations.
        theme: '[AI] `mdbook init --theme` is a command used with the Mdbook book builder for creating new books using Markdown files. The `--theme` option specifies which pre-built theme to use for styling and layout of the generated output, such as HTML or PDF. It doesn''t create a new theme itself but installs the chosen one if it is not already available in the local Mdbook cache. This command sets up the project structure with basic files and configurations needed for using Mdbook to build and publish your technical writing projects.'
        title: '[AI] `mdbook init` is a command used in the Rust programming language ecosystem to create a new project using Mdbook, a static site generator for markdown files. The `--title` option sets the title of the generated website or book. For example, `mdbook init --title "My Project"` would create a new project named "My Project" with a default file structure and configuration for building a website or eBook using Mdbook from Markdown files.'
        version: '[AI] `mdbook init --version` is a command used with the MDBook book generator, which is a tool for creating static websites from Markdown files. The `init` subcommand initializes a new MDBook project in a specified directory. Adding the `--version` flag requests the version number of MDBook to be displayed, providing information about which version of the software is being used.'
