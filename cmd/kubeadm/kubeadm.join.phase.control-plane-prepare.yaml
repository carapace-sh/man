        [AI] `kubeadm join` is a command used to join worker nodes to a Kubernetes cluster managed by `kubeadm`. The `phase control-plane-prepare` is one of the several phases that this command goes through during the node's joining process.

        In this phase, the control plane node (or master node) performs various preparations before accepting new worker nodes to join the cluster. This includes:

        1. Validating the authenticity and authorization of the join request by checking the token provided against the kubeadm's certificate authority or other authentication methods.
        2. Ensuring that all prerequisites for a control plane node are met, such as having sufficient resources and meeting specific software requirements.
        3. Creating Kubernetes certificates and keys, including a client certificate for the joining worker node, and a new CA key for signing any future certificates.
        4. Updating the kubelet configuration on the worker node to communicate with the master node, and making necessary changes to the master node's kubeconfig file.
        5. Setting up firewall rules between the nodes as needed.

        Once all these preparations are complete, the `kubeadm join` command proceeds to the next phase where the worker node is actually joined to the cluster.
