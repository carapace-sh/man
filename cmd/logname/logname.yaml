documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `logname` command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems is used to determine the name of the current system runlevel or, equivalently, the default system runlevel. A runlevel is a configuration state that defines which processes should be running at startup and under normal operation. For example, "logname -p" will display the present (currently active) runlevel as a number, such as "3". No arguments are needed when invoking this command for it to display the default runlevel.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `logname --help` is a command used in Unix-based systems to display information about the logname utility. This command provides a brief description of what logname does, which is to identify the system or subsystem associated with a given user or process based on its login name or process ID. It also lists the available options and their functions, such as `--help`, which displays detailed help information, `-f FILE`, to read configuration from a file instead of the default one, and `-p PID`, to get the logname for a given process ID.'
        version: '[AI] The `logname --version` command is used to display the version information of the `logname` utility, which is a Linux system tool for determining the name of the terminal line or virtual console from which a process was started. When executed with this command, it will print out the specific version number and other relevant details such as the build date and compiler used to compile the software. This can be useful for ensuring compatibility with other systems and for troubleshooting purposes.'
