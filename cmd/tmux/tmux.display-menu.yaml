    command: '[AI] The `tmux display-menu` command is a TMUX built-in command that displays an interactive menu of available terminal windows, panes, and sessions within the current TMUX environment. It allows users to quickly navigate and select specific sessions or panes using arrow keys or other keyboard shortcuts. This can be particularly useful when managing multiple terminal sessions in a single terminal window.'
    flag:
        O: '[AI] `tmux display-menu` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer software used to show information about attached sessions or windows. The option `-O` modifies the output format of this command. Instead of showing each session or window in a separate line with its name and status, it outputs all the information in a single line separated by tabs, allowing for easier parsing or scripting.'
        T: '[AI] The `tmux display-menu` command is used to show a menu of available sessions, windows, and panes in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. The `-T` option sets a title for the menu. For example, `tmux display-menu -T "Session Menu"` will display the menu with the title "Session Menu". This command does not take any argument beyond the `-T` option for setting the title and it returns an exit code of 0 if successful, or an error code otherwise.'
        c: '[AI] `tmux display-menu` is a Tmux command that shows a menu of current sessions, windows, and panes in the terminal. The `-c` option (short for "--status-command") allows users to specify a custom command or script to be run for generating the status bar output. This can be useful for displaying additional information or formatting the output according to specific needs. For instance, you might use a shell command like "echo ''Session: ${tmux pane_active -p}. Window: $(tmux active-window -g).Pane: $(tmux pane-number -p)''" to show the current session, window, and pane number in the menu.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux display-menu` command is used in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, to show a menu of available sessions, windows, or panes on the terminal. The `-t` option specifies the target window or pane where the menu will be displayed. When executed, this command brings up an interactive menu allowing users to select and manipulate TMUX sessions, windows, or panes. This can be useful for managing complex terminal environments with multiple sessions and windows.'
        x: '[AI] `tmux display-menu` is a Tmux command used to display the current layout of splits in a Tmux terminal multiplexer session. The `-x` option makes the output of this command be printed to the standard output (terminal) in a format that can be parsed by external scripts or tools, as a series of comma-separated strings representing the size and geometry information of each pane in the session.'
        "y": '[AI] `tmux display-menu` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer used to show a menu of available sessions, windows, or panes on the terminal screen. The `-y` option makes the menu appear at the bottom of the screen instead of the default top location. This can be useful for users who prefer having the menu at the bottom for better visibility with other applications or terminal output at the top.'
