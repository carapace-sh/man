    -v, --verbose: When merging notes, be more verbose
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `git notes prune` command is used to remove all expired Git notes from the local repository. Git notes are annotations or messages associated with specific Git commits, and they can be given expiry dates. When a note expires, it becomes eligible for removal. The `git notes prune` command helps in keeping the local Git repository free of expired notes by automatically removing them.'
    flag:
        dry-run: '[AI] `git notes prune --dry-run` is a Git command used to simulate the effect of the `git notes prune` command without actually deleting any notes. This command helps in reviewing which notes will be deleted before running the actual pruning command, preventing accidental loss of important notes. It displays a list of notes that would be deleted based on the default note expiration settings (30 days by default), but no notes are actually removed during this operation.'
        verbose: '[AI] `git notes prune --verbose` is a Git command used to remove old annotated tags (notes) that have been deleted locally or are no longer needed. The `--verbose` option increases the output level, displaying detailed information about each note being pruned. This includes the tag name, its commit hash, and the reason for its deletion.'
