    command: '[AI] The `brew bump-unversioned-casks` command is a Homebrew (macOS package manager) utility that automatically increments the version number of unpinned casks (Homebrew''s term for installable packages) in your local repository without updating them. By running this command, you prepare your system to create new versions or releases with updated dependencies when using `brew release`. It''s essential for managing Homebrew taps and keeping the version numbers synchronized.'
    flag:
        debug: |-
            [AI] The command `brew bump-unversioned-casks --debug` is a Homebrew (a popular package manager for macOS) subcommand used to update the version numbers of unpinned formulas in a repository, specifically those that are Casks (Homebrew's package installer for Mac applications).

            By adding `--debug`, you request a more verbose output which can help debug any potential issues during the process. The command itself does not change the actual version numbers immediately but generates commit messages with suggested changes to the version numbers. To apply these suggested changes, you would then use `brew commit` or `git commit` to create and push the new commits.

            In summary, this command is used for managing the versioning of unpinned Casks in a Homebrew repository, providing debug information during the process.
        dry-run: |-
            [AI] `brew bump-unversioned-casks` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command with the `--dry-run` option is used to perform a simulation of version bumping for unversioned Homebrew Cask formulas without actually making any changes.

            Casks are Homebrew's method for installing Mac applications and their dependencies, allowing easier management of application installations. Unversioned casks refer to those without a defined version number in their formula, which can make upgrading or managing these formulas more challenging.

            The `--dry-run` option is used to see what would happen if the command were executed without actually executing it. In this case, when running `brew bump-unversioned-casks --dry-run`, Homebrew will simulate version bumping for any unversioned cask formulas and display the changes that would be made, such as updated formula versions or dependencies. If satisfied with the output, you can then run `brew bump-unversioned-casks` without the `--dry-run` option to apply these changes.
        help: |-
            [AI] `brew bump` is a command provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `bump` command facilitates version management for Homebrew's Cask installations, which handle non-Homebrew software.

            The `--unversioned` option tells `bump` to work on unversioned dependencies, i.e., Cask formulas that don't have a specific version number in their formula name. By default, `bump` manages versions for formulas with version numbers.

            `--help` is an optional argument to display help information about the command and its usage. With this option, Homebrew will provide you with a brief description of what the command does, a list of available options, and their explanations. In summary, `brew bump --unversioned --help` provides instructions on how to use the unversioned Casks version management feature in Homebrew.
        limit: |-
            [AI] The `brew` command with the argument `bump-unversioned-casks --limit` is used to update the versions of unpinned (unversioned) Homebrew Cask formulas in your system. Here's a brief explanation:

            1. `brew`: This is the Homebrew package manager for macOS.
            2. `bump-unversioned-casks`: This is a subcommand of Brew, which helps manage dependencies and install packages from third-party sources called Casks. The `bump-unversioned-casks` command specifically deals with unpinned (unversioned) Casks.
            3. `--limit`: This is an optional argument that can be passed to the command for limiting the number of Casks to update at a time. By default, there's no limit. When you use this argument, Brew will only update up to the specified number of Casks before asking for confirmation.
            4. In summary, `brew bump-unversioned-casks --limit <number>` updates the unpinned Homebrew Casks in your system one by one, with an optional limit on how many to update at a time.
        quiet: '[AI] `brew bump` is a Homebrew command used to update the version of a specific installed package or formula in the Homebrew system. The `--unversioned-casks` option tells Homebrew to handle unversioned Cask dependencies (those without a specified version number) during the update process. The `--quiet` flag suppresses informational messages and output from the command, allowing it to run quietly in the background.'
        state-file: |-
            [AI] The `brew bump` command is a utility provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command, `brew bump <formula> --state-file`, is used to increment the version number of a specific formula in Homebrew's cellar, located in `/usr/local/Cellar`.

            When you run this command with the name of a formula as an argument (e.g., `brew bump my-formula`), it will automatically detect and increment the next semantic version based on the current state of the formula. The `--state-file` option appends the current state to a file, typically `BREW_HOOKS/tap/<your-tap>/<repository-name>/<formula-name>.state`, which can be useful for recording and tracking changes to the formula's state.

            It is essential to note that using this command will commit changes to Homebrew's repository, so you should use it carefully and ensure that your modifications are well-documented before sharing them with others in the Homebrew community.
        verbose: '[AI] `brew bump` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `bump` subcommand helps manage version numbers of Homebrew formulae. The `--unversioned-casks` option instructs `bump` to handle unversioned casks (third-party software packages) as well. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of information printed during the command execution, providing more detailed output for better understanding of the ongoing process. In summary, this command updates version numbers of Homebrew formulae and their related casks while displaying extensive details about the progress.'
