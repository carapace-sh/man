description: Execute a Bloblang mapping on documents consumed via stdin
flags:
    --max-token-length=: Set the buffer size for document lines.
    -f, --file=: execute a mapping from a file.
    -p, --pretty: pretty-print output.
    -r, --raw: consume raw strings.
    -t, --threads=: the number of processing threads to use, when >1 ordering is no longer guaranteed.

    command: '[AI] The command "benthos blobl" is not a standard command and does not exist in any known context, including Benthos, a popular open-source data processing workflow system for streaming data. Please double-check the command syntax or consult the relevant documentation to ensure accuracy.'
    flag:
        file: '[AI] The `benthos flag --file` is used to specify a configuration file in Benthos, an open-source data pipeline processor. This flag instructs Benthos to read its configuration settings from the provided file instead of using default values or command-line arguments. It helps users customize their pipeline processing workflows by allowing them to define various aspects such as input and output connections, processing steps, and error handling in a structured and persistent manner.'
        max-token-length: '[AI] The `benthos flag --max-token-length` sets the maximum length of a single token in Benthos data processing pipelines. Longer tokens are split into smaller pieces that fit within this limit during data ingestion and serialization processes. This helps ensure efficient processing by downstream components, which might have limitations on handling large tokens.'
        pretty: '[AI] The `benthos flags --pretty` command is used in Benthos, an open-source data processing pipeline, to print out flags and their values in a human-readable format. This can be helpful for understanding the current configuration of a Benthos pipeline without having to parse complex JSON or YAML files. When you run `benthos flags --pretty`, it will output each flag name followed by an equal sign and its corresponding value, separated by whitespace, making it easier to identify and review the settings.'
        raw: '[AI] The command `benthos blobl --raw` is a part of Benthos, an open-source data pipeline processor. In this specific configuration, `blobl` refers to a Benthos loader for processing data from Blob Storage. The `--raw` flag indicates that the raw data should be passed through the pipeline instead of parsing or transforming it in any way. In summary, this command loads data from Blob Storage as is and sends it downstream in the Benthos pipeline.'
        threads: '[AI] The `benthos flags --blobl --threads` is a command-line argument used in Benthos, an open-source data processing system. This specific combination of flags instructs Benthos to process input data using the Blobl processor with multiple threads for parallel processing. Blobl is a processor within Benthos designed to manipulate and transform data blobs based on definitions in YAML or JSON files. By enabling multi-threading with the `--threads` flag, Benthos can process multiple input data blobs concurrently, improving overall performance for large data processing tasks.'
