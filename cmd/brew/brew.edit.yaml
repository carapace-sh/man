documentation:
    command: '[AI] `brew edit` is a command offered by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, that opens the formula file associated with an installed package in a text editor for editing.

    flag:
        cask: '[AI] `brew edit --cask` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command opens an interactive editor to let users edit the configuration of cask (graphical user interface) installations before installing or upgrading them. It''s particularly useful when you need to customize the installation options of a cask application, like specifying additional arguments or dependencies. The changes made in the editor get saved as modifications in the Homebrew Configuration file, allowing you to apply those edits every time you update or install the affected cask using Homebrew.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew edit --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--debug` flag is an optional argument that enables debug mode when using the `edit` sub-command. This command opens the file management interface for a specific Homebrew installation or formula in a text editor, allowing users to edit its content. In debug mode, additional diagnostic information is printed out to help identify and resolve potential issues during the editing process.'
        formula: '[AI] `brew edit --formula` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command opens the formula file associated with a specific Homebrew package in a text editor for editing. A formula is a script that defines how a Homebrew package should be installed and managed. By editing the formula file, users can customize or modify the installation process of the package.'
        help: '[AI] `brew edit` is a command from Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--help` option is used to display detailed information about a specific brew command. In this case, `brew edit --help` provides details on how to use the `brew edit` command, which is used to edit the files in a formula before installing or upgrading it. It explains options such as specifying a particular formula to edit, opening the editor of your choice, and automatically merging changes back into Homebrew when you save and close the editor.'
        print-path: '[AI] The `brew edit --print-path` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command displays the paths to the installed versions of Homebrew-managed formulas and their cellar directories. It does not open an editor for editing these files as the name might suggest. Instead, it provides information about the locations of the managed packages.'
        quiet: '[AI] `brew edit --quiet` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command opens the file associated with a Homebrew formula or tap in a text editor without displaying any messages or progress bars. The `--quiet` option suppresses informational output during the editing process, allowing users to focus on making changes to the files directly.'
