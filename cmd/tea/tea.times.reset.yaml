documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "tea times reset" command is not a standard command in any known computing system or software. It appears to be a misspelled variant of the more common "teamtimes reset" or "teams reset" commands, which are used to reset settings or configurations in Microsoft Teams, a collaboration platform. When used correctly, these commands will restore default settings or revert changes made to Teams settings. However, without more context, it is impossible to know for certain what "tea times reset" is intended to do.'
    flag:
        login: |-
            [AI] The command `tea times reset --login` is related to the TeaVM virtual machine, which is a Java bytecode virtual machine designed for secure and efficient execution of Java code in web browsers.

            This specific command resets the TeaVM's login state. More precisely, it clears any previously saved authentication information and forces the user to log in again when they want to use the TeaVM-enabled application. This is typically used for security purposes to ensure that unauthorized users do not gain access to an application through stolen or shared credentials.
        remote: '[AI] The `tea times reset --remote` command is a Git operation used to discard all local changes and revert the working directory to match the most recent commit on the remote repository. This command should be run when you want to completely reset your local repository to the latest state of the remote one, effectively undoing any local modifications or commits that haven''t been pushed yet. It is useful for resolving merge conflicts, updating to the latest codebase, or when you inadvertently went down a wrong development path.'
        repo: |-
            [AI] The `tea times reset` command is not a standard flag or command in Git or any other version control system. It seems to be specific to the TeaTime Git client, which is an unofficial Git interface for Slack.

            The `--repo` flag that can sometimes appear with this command is used to specify the name of the Git repository to reset. The `reset` action in Git resets the current branch to a specified commit, removing any changes that have been made since that commit. The `tea times reset --repo <repository-name>` command in this context would reset the specified Git repository's branch to the latest commit (HEAD) in the local repository.
