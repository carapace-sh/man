            [AI] `flutter pub cache repair` is a command used in the Flutter framework to repair corrupted cache files in the `.pub-cache` directory. Running `flutter pub cache repair --help` displays the detailed help information for this command. Here's a summary of what you can find in the help output:

            * The command repairs the Flutter package cache by deleting and re-downloading corrupted or missing packages.
            * It can be run with various options:
              - `--no-self`: Excludes the `flutter` package from being repaired (it is always present and doesn't need repair).
              - `--quiet` or `--verbose`: Adjusts the level of output during the repair process.
            * The command attempts to preserve existing local modifications to packages, but you may be prompted to confirm overwriting modified files if necessary.
            * Repairing the cache can take a significant amount of time depending on your internet connection and the size of the corrupted or missing packages.
