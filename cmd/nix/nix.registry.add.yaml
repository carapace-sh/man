documentation:
    command: '[AI] `nix registry add` is a Nix package manager command used to add a new repository or package collection to your Nix expression language configuration. The syntax is `nix registry add <url>`, where `<url>` is the URL of the Nix express-ions repository or collection you want to add. This command updates the configuration file `./nix/config.nix` with the new repository information, allowing you to install packages from it using `nix-env -i <package>`.'
    flag:
        arg: |-
            [AI] `nix registry add` is a command in Nix Package Manager used to add a new package repository, also known as a registry, to your Nix expression language. The `--arg` option is used to pass arguments to the registry's configuration. For instance, if the registry requires an authentication token for access, you would use this option to provide it:

            ```bash
            nix registry add <registry-url> --arg <name=<token>>
            ```

            Replace `<registry-url>` with the URL of your registry and `<token>` with your authentication token. This will configure the registry with the provided argument, allowing you to authenticate and pull packages from it using Nix Package Manager.
        argstr: |-
            [AI] `nix registry add` is a command used in Nix packaging system to add a new package repository to your Nix expression language configuration. The `--argstr` option is used to pass arguments to the Nix expression that defines the registry. It takes a string argument containing key-value pairs, where each pair represents an argument for the Nix expression. For example:

            ```bash
            nix registry add <registry-url> --argstr="myArg=myValue"
            ```

            Adds a new registry with the given URL and sets the value of `myArg` to `myValue` in the Nix expression for that registry.
        debug: '[AI] `nix-registry` is a command-line tool for managing Nix packages. The command `nix registry add --debug` adds a new package to the Nixpkgs repository, which is the default and most widely used registry in the Nix Package Manager ecosystem. The `--debug` option enables verbose output, providing detailed information about the addition process, including any errors or warnings that may occur. It''s useful for developers who want to understand the underlying mechanics of adding a package or troubleshooting issues.'
        debugger: '[AI] `nix registry add --debugger` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command is used to add a new package to the Nixpkgs repository, which is the default and most commonly used registry in Nix. The `--debugger` flag enables debugging mode during the registration process. This provides more detailed output and can help diagnose issues if something goes wrong during the addition of the new package.'
        eval-store: '[AI] `nix registry add` is a command used in Nix packaging system to add a new package repository, also known as a registry, to your Nix expression language configuration. The `--eval-store` option is used to evaluate expressions and store the results in the Nix store instead of downloading files from the registry. This can be useful for building custom packages or making local modifications before adding them to the registry. The evaluated expressions are stored as derivations, which can then be referred to in other expressions or built into final packages.'
        impure: '[AI] The `nix-registry add --impure` command is used in Nix packaging to add a new package definition to an existing Nix expression without rebuilding the entire expression from scratch. The `--impure` flag indicates that the operation should not be pure, meaning that the new package definition may depend on packages or expressions that have not been built yet. This allows for incremental updates and iterative development of package definitions in large Nix expressions without requiring a full rebuild each time.'
        include: '[AI] `nix registry add --include` is a command used in Nix package manager to add a new Git repository as a Nix expression in the user''s Nix registry. The `--include` option tells Nix to include all branches and tags of the Git repository when adding it, allowing the user to easily manage and install packages from those branches or tags as if they were official Nix expressions.'
        log-format: |-
            [AI] The `nix registry add` command is used to add a new package or a new version of an existing package to the Nix Package Manager registry. The `--log-format` option specifies the format of the output log generated during the operation.

            There are two common log formats: "json" and "plain". The default is "plain", which prints messages in a human-readable format. With the "--log-format json" option, the output will be in JSON format, making it easier to parse programmatically. This can be useful for scripting or automated tasks.

            Here's an example of using "--log-format json":

            ```bash
            nix registry add <package-name> --log-format json
            ```

            This will output the log information in JSON format when adding a new package to the Nix registry.
        override-flake: |-
            [AI] `nix registry add` is a command used in Nix packaging system to add a new package or update an existing one in your Nix profile or a custom channel. The `--override-flake` flag modifies the behavior of this command:

            Instead of adding or updating a normal Nix expression file, it adds or updates a Flakes configuration file (with the extension .flake-lock). Flakes is a new package management feature in Nix that allows for more flexible and fine-grained dependencies. By using `--override-flake`, you can override the content of an existing Flakes configuration file with a new one, effectively updating or modifying the dependencies of a Nix project.
        print-build-logs: '[AI] The `nix-registry` command with the `add` subcommand is used to install or update a specific Nix package from the Nix Pakages Server. The option `--print-build-logs` asks Nix to print the build logs of the package being installed or updated to the standard output. In simple terms, it displays the detailed information about the package building process, including any error messages if an issue occurs during the build.'
        quiet: '[AI] `nix registry add` is a command used in Nix packaging system to add a new package repository to your Nix expression language configuration. The `--quiet` option is used to suppress informational messages during the execution of this command. In other words, it runs the command silently without displaying any output except for error messages if any occur.'
        registry: '[AI] `nix registry add` is a command used in Nix packaging system to add a new repository or registry to the Nix expression language search path. This allows you to easily access and install packages from that registry in your Nix environment. The full command syntax is `nix registry add <name> <URL>`. For example, `nix registry add my-registry http://my-registry.example.com`. After adding the registry, you can install packages from it by specifying their names and versions, for instance `nix-env -iA my-registry.my-package`.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] The `nix-registry` is a component of Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The command `nix registry add --verbose` is used to add a new repository (also called a "registry") to the Nix expression language search path.

            Here's a breakdown of the components of the command:

            * `nix-registry`: This is the command-line tool that interacts with the Nix Pakages Server (or a self-hosted Nix registry), which allows you to download and manage software packages for your system.
            * `add`: This action adds a new repository to the search path of the Nix package manager, allowing it to fetch and install packages from that repository.
            * `--verbose`: This option increases the level of output provided by the command. In this context, it will display detailed information about each step taken during the addition process, including HTTP requests, responses, and any error messages.
