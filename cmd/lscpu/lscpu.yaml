documentation:
    command: '[AI] `lscpu` is a Linux command-line utility that displays information about the processor architecture and cores in the system. It reads data from the /proc/cpuinfo file and presents it in a more human-readable format. The output includes details like the number of processors, CPU model name, cores per socket, cache sizes, and other relevant features. This command provides useful information for system administrators to understand their hardware setup, especially when dealing with multi-core or multi-socket systems.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `lscpu --all` is a Linux command used to display detailed information about the processor architecture and topology of the system. The `--all` option requests that all available data be displayed, which includes the number of processors, cores per socket, threads per core, cache sizes, supported instructions sets, and other related details. This command is useful for system administrators to understand the hardware capabilities of a system for optimization purposes or troubleshooting.'
        bytes: '[AI] The `lscpu` command is a Linux utility used to display CPU architecture information. The `--bytes` option is not a standard option for this command. It seems there might be some confusion as I couldn''t find any documentation mentioning this option specifically. The standard usage of `lscpu` is to display CPU architecture information in human-readable format, while options like `--architecture`, `--mode`, and `--info` are commonly used to provide more detailed output. If you meant a different command or option, please let me know for accurate information.'
        caches: '[AI] The `lscpu` command with the option `--caches` provides information about the type and size of the CPU cache on a Linux system. The output displays the total cache size, the size of the L1D (Last Level Data) cache, and the size of the L2/L3 cache (combined). This information helps in understanding the cache hierarchy and performance characteristics of the processor.'
        extended: |-
            [AI] `lscpu --extended` is a command used in Linux systems to display detailed information about the CPU architecture and capabilities. The `--extended` option expands the output to include more detailed data, such as:

            1. Number of CPUs or cores per socket
            2. Architecture (x86_64, armv7l, etc.)
            3. Cache sizes (L1, L2, L3)
            4. FPU features and their capabilities
            5. Virtualization technologies supported
            6. Hypervisor information (if applicable)
            7. Advanced CPU features like SSE, AVX, etc.
            8. CPU flags (like Unhaltable, KVM-x86, etc.)
            9. Features enabled via kernel configuration

            The output is typically displayed in a tabular format and can be redirected to a file or piped to other commands for further processing.
        help: |-
            [AI] `lscpu` is a Linux command-line utility used to display information about the processor architecture and topology of the system. The option `--help` displays detailed help information on how to use the `lscpu` command. This includes a brief description of what the tool does, a list of available options with their short and long forms, and examples of how to use each option. For instance:

            ```bash

        hex: '[AI] `lscpu` is a Linux command-line utility used to display information about the processor(s) on a system. The `--hex` option is not a standard option for this command, but it can be achieved by piping the output of `lscpu` to the `xxd -p` command. The hexadecimal output shows the machine code instructions in Intel x86 or similar architectures'' binary format, representing the CPU architecture, features, and microcode levels in a compact, human-unreadable form. This information can be useful for advanced system administrators, developers, and security researchers.'
        json: '[AI] `lscpu` is a Linux command-line utility that provides information about the processor architecture and topology of the system. The `--json` option is used to output the data in JSON format, making it easier for parsing and processing by scripts or other programs. The JSON output includes fields such as `architecture`, `cachesize`, `cores`, `threads_per_core`, `physicalid`, `socket_id`, and others, providing detailed information about each processor core on the system.'
        offline: '[AI] `lscpu --offline` is a command used in Linux systems to display detailed information about the CPU architecture and topology without checking online data from external sources like CPUdb or IntelÂ® ARK. The `--offline` option disables this behavior, making the tool retrieve data only from local system information. This can be useful when you want to ensure privacy or when you''re working offline.'
        online: '[AI] `lscpu --online` is a Linux command used to display information about the CPU architecture and topology supported by the system. The `--online` option filters the output to show only the processors that are currently online and available for use by the operating system. This can be useful for identifying offline or non-functioning processors in a multi-processor system.'
        output-all: '[AI] `lscpu` is a Linux command used to display CPU architecture and topology information. The option `--output-all` requests that all available information be displayed in a tabular format. This includes details such as the number of processors, cores per processor, threads per core, CPU family, model, stepping, cache sizes, and other related features. The output is useful for system administrators and developers to understand the capabilities and limitations of the system''s CPUs.'
        parse: '[AI] `lscpu --parse` is a command used in Linux systems to extract and display CPU architecture-specific information in a format that can be parsed by other scripts or tools. The output is usually printed as key-value pairs, where each key represents a specific CPU feature or characteristic and its corresponding value denotes the relevant information for that feature. This command provides a convenient way to access detailed CPU information programmatically without having to manually parse text-based outputs from other commands such as `/proc/cpuinfo`.'
        physical: '[AI] The `lscpu --physical` command is a Linux utility that displays information about the CPU architecture and topology of the system. The `--physical` option specifically focuses on the physical CPUs (as opposed to logical processors or cores) in the system. It provides details such as the number of processors, their model names, cache sizes, and other architectural features. The output is typically tabular, with columns for various attributes.'
        sysroot: '[AI] The `lscpu` command is a Linux utility used to display CPU architecture-specific information. The option `--sysroot` changes the location where `lscpu` looks for its data files and libraries, allowing it to be run from a different root file system than its default. This can be useful in certain system administration tasks, such as troubleshooting or testing, where you may need to inspect CPU information from a different Linux installation.'
        version: '[AI] `lscpu --version` is a Linux command used to display information about the CPU architecture and capabilities supported by the system''s kernel. The `--version` option specifically shows the version of the `lscpu` utility itself, providing details such as its name, version number, and author information. The majority of output will still pertain to the system''s CPUs, but the focus is on displaying metadata about the `lscpu` command itself.'
