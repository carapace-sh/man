documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `git remote get-url` command is used to display the URL that is currently configured for a remote repository in Git. This command retrieves and prints out the URL associated with a named remote, which can be helpful for verifying or updating the URL when working with multiple remotes or remote repositories.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `git remote get-url --all` is a Git command used to retrieve the URLs of all configured remote repositories. The `--all` option fetches URLs for both the main (upstream) and local (origin) repositories. The output will display each remote name followed by its corresponding URL, which can be useful when working with multiple remotes or when migrating projects between servers.'
        push: '[AI] The `git remote get-url --push` command retrieves the URL configured for pushing to a remote repository in Git. In other words, it displays the URL where commits can be pushed from the local repository.'
