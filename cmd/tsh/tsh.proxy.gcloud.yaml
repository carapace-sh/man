    -p, --port=: Specifies the source port used by the proxy listener.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "tsh proxy gcloud" is used in the Tengine (Tairan Shuji) reverse proxy server environment. It initiates a connection to Google Cloud Platform using the gcloud tool, allowing Tengine to proxy and forward traffic from the local machine to Google Cloud services. This can be useful for managing and routing traffic between applications or services hosted both locally and in the cloud.'
    flag:
        app: |-
            [AI] The command `gcloud tsh proxy app` is used in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to create and manage a forwarding rule for Traffic Director, which is a global, external HTTP(S) load balancer. The `tsh` part stands for Traffic Director Shell, while `proxy` is the subcommand to configure a forwarding rule as a proxy.

            This command sets up a proxy to forward incoming traffic from external clients to one or more backend services that you specify in your GCP project. The purpose of using a proxy is to apply security policies, such as SSL termination or authentication checks, before forwarding the requests to the backends. Additionally, it allows for traffic splitting based on source IP addresses, which can be useful for implementing canary releases or A/B testing.

            When executed, this command creates, updates, or deletes a proxy configuration in your Traffic Director based on the provided flags and arguments. For example: `gcloud tsh proxy app create my-proxy --url http://myapp.example.com`. This command creates a new proxy named 'my-proxy' that listens for incoming requests on the URL `http://myapp.example.com` and forwards them to one or more backend services in your GCP project.
        format: '[AI] `tsh proxy gcloud --format` is a command using Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) with Traffic Server (Tsh) as a proxy. The `--format` option specifies how the output should be formatted, typically used for tabular or JSON outputs to ease further processing. In this case, `tsh proxy` sets up a Traffic Server as a reverse proxy and forwards requests to gcloud API. The exact behavior depends on the specific usage of these commands in context.'
        port: '[AI] The command `gcloud tsh proxy --port` is used in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to start a forwarding proxy for Traffic Director, which is part of Google''s Traffic Management System. This command sets the listening port number for the proxy, allowing incoming traffic to be forwarded to backends defined in a Traffic Director configuration. The flag `--port` specifies this port number.'
