    command: '[AI] The `pass otp uri` command in Pass, a password manager, is used to generate and display a One-Time Password (OTP) for a specific entry with an associated OTP secret. The URI argument is the identifier or label of that entry in Pass database. When executed, this command will output the OTP along with its expiration time or validity window, enabling users to securely authenticate to services requiring two-factor authentication.'
    flag:
        clip: '[AI] The command `pass otp uri --clip` is a function in the Pass password manager, which generates and displays an One-Time Password (OTP) URI for a specific entry. The `--clip` option means that after generating the OTP URI, it will automatically be copied to your system clipboard, ready to be pasted into another application when needed. This feature makes it convenient to quickly obtain and transfer the OTP without manually copying it.'
        qrcode: '[AI] The `--pass-otp-uri --qrcode` flag is used in command-line tools or scripts, often related to two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA). This option generates a One-Time Password (OTP) URI in QR code format. When scanned by an authenticator application on a user''s device, the app will automatically configure itself with the correct OTP secret key and issuer information, enabling seamless 2FA or MFA for the associated account. This flag streamlines the setup process, making it more convenient and less error-prone for users.'
