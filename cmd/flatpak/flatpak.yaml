documentation:
    command: '[AI] Flatpak is a software deployment and packaging system for Linux-based operating systems. It allows applications to be installed in isolated sandboxed environments, ensuring security and compatibility across different distributions. Applications are packaged with their dependencies and run with limited permissions. The Flatpak command-line tool (also called "flatpak") is used to install, update, remove, and manage these packages.'
    flag:
        default-arch: '[AI] `flatpak --default-arch` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux desktops. This command sets the default architecture for installing and running Flatpak applications. By default, Flatpak uses the native system architecture, but you can use this command to explicitly set another architecture (e.g., `--default-arch x86_64` or `armv7l`) for your development or testing environment. This ensures that all installed Flatpak applications will be built and run using the specified architecture.'
        gl-drivers: '[AI] `flatpak --gl-drivers` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. It lists the available OpenGL (Graphics Library) drivers that can be installed and used by Flatpak applications. This command helps ensure that applications have access to the necessary OpenGL drivers for optimal graphical performance.'
        help: '[AI] `flatpak --help` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager system to display help information about the Flatpak utility itself. The output includes detailed usage instructions, a list of available commands and their functions, as well as options that can be used with each command. It''s a quick way for users to familiarize themselves with the various capabilities of the Flatpak tool.'
        installations: '[AI] `flatpak --installations` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to list installed applications and their corresponding runtime environments. The output shows each application''s name, ID, version, and the active branch (runtime) of its environment. This command helps users manage and keep track of their installed Flatpak applications and their associated runtime environments.'
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak --ostree-verbose` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. This specific command instructs Flatpak to use OSTree as its backend for managing the filesystem snapshots instead of using the default Upstart or systemd methods. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output displayed during the operation to provide more detailed information about what Flatpak is doing while it creates, updates, or manages the OSTree-based application repository.'
        print-system-only: '[AI] `flatpak --print-system-only` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. This command prints out a list of all installed Flatpak applications that are intended for the system (as opposed to per-user installations). System applications are typically installed using the system''s package manager or by an administrator with root privileges. These applications can be accessed by all users on the system, making them useful for providing common functionality across user sessions.'
        print-updated-env: '[AI] `flatpak --print-updated-env` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system for Linux platforms. The command prints out the environment variables that will be used when running a specific Flatpak application or runtime. These environment variables can include things like PATH settings, library paths, and other configuration options, which may differ from the system''s default environment. This command allows you to see exactly what environment the application will run in, which can be useful for troubleshooting or understanding how an application might behave differently when installed via Flatpak versus other methods.'
        supported-arches: '[AI] `flatpak --supported-archtes` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. This command lists the architectures (e.g., i386, x86_64, armv7l) that are currently supported on your system for installing and running Flatpak applications. It helps ensure compatibility between the Flatpak runtime and the target applications based on their architecture requirements.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak --verbose` is a command used in the Flatpak software packaging system. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output displayed during the execution of Flatpak commands. It provides more detailed information about the ongoing operation, including debug messages and progress updates, which can be helpful for troubleshooting or understanding complex processes.'
        version: '[AI] `flatpak --version` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to display the version number of the installed Flatpak runtime itself. The output shows the major, minor, and micro release numbers, as well as any additional tag or build information. This command helps users ensure they have the latest version of Flatpak for optimal performance and security.'
