documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `brew unlink` command is used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to disassociate a previously installed package or dependency from the system. Once a package is unlinked, Homebrew will not manage it anymore, allowing users to manually manage it or remove it entirely. This command does not delete the package but removes the symlink between Homebrew and the installed package, releasing resources for other installations or upgrades.'
    flag:
        debug: |-
            [AI] `brew unlink --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `unlink` sub-command is used to remove a previously installed Homebrew formula or cask, which in turn removes the related files and symlinks from the system.

            The `--debug` flag adds additional output during the uninstallation process, providing more detailed information about the files being removed and any dependencies that may be affected. This can be helpful for troubleshooting issues with Homebrew installations or understanding how various packages interact with each other.
        dry-run: '[AI] The `brew unlink --dry-run` command is a preview operation in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. It simulates the effect of unlinking (removing links to) an installed Homebrew package without actually executing the action. This allows users to see what would be affected by the actual `unlink` command before they decide to proceed with it.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `brew unlink` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to unlink or remove a previously installed Homebrew formula or cask without deleting it from the system. When you run `brew unlink --help`, you will see a brief help message explaining the purpose and usage of this command:

            ```sh
            Usage: brew unlink [FORMULA|CASK]

            Unlinks (but does not delete) a Formula or Cask
            ```

            The primary function of `brew unlink` is to disassociate a package from Homebrew, allowing you to manage it manually without interfering with Homebrew's management. You can specify the formula or cask name as an argument when using this command.
        quiet: |-
            [AI] `brew unlink` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--quiet` option is an argument that quiets the output of the command. In other words, it suppresses any informational or success messages displayed during the command's execution.

            The primary function of the `brew unlink` command is to unlink (or remove a symlink) for a previously installed Homebrew package or formula from your system. This can be helpful if you want to install an older version of the same package, or if you are having issues with the currently installed package and need to troubleshoot.

            In summary, `brew unlink --quiet` is used to remove the symlink for a Homebrew package silently without displaying any messages during execution.
        verbose: '[AI] `brew unlink` is a command provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to manage installed formulas and casks (packages). The `--verbose` flag, when used with this command, increases the amount of output that Homebrew displays during the unlinking process. This output includes detailed information about the files and directories being removed or modified as part of the uninstallation. The purpose is to provide more transparency about the actions Homebrew is taking.'
