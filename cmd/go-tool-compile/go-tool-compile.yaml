documentation:
    command: '[AI] `go build` is a command used in Go programming language for compiling Go source files into executable programs or libraries. It reads theGo source file(s) with import paths, resolves dependencies, and then builds the code. The output is usually an executable binary or shared library depending on the context of usage. This command assumes that your Go environment is properly set up and configured.'
    flag:
        '%': '[AI] `go-tool-compile -%` is a command used in the Go programming language to invoke the `go compile` tool with the special flag `-%`. This flag instructs the compiler to only output the compiled object files instead of generating an executable binary or performing any linking. The resulting object files can be further processed, for instance, by other linkers or assemblers, allowing more complex build processes or integrating with external tools.'
        +: '[AI] The `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from Go programming language. The `-+` flag is not a standard flag used with this tool. It seems to be incorrectly written, as the correct usage of flags with `go-tool-compile` would be something like `go build`, `go test`, or `go run` followed by specific flags for compilation options such as `-o`, `-gc`, or `-x`. If you intended to use multiple flags, separate them with spaces.'
        B: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, used to compile Go source code into executable binaries or shared libraries. The `-B` flag (lowercase "B") is an optional argument for this command that instructs it to perform a "build and not run" operation. In other words, it only compiles the given Go files but does not execute them afterwards. This can be useful when you want to create a binary or library without actually running any tests or example code included in the source files.'
        C: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in the Go programming language used for compiling Go source code. The `-C` flag is an option passed to this tool, which stands for "create only" or "compile and link but don''t build a binary." In simpler terms, it instructs the compiler to produce object files from the source code but not create an executable binary. This can be useful when you want to check for compilation errors without generating a final binary, like during continuous integration builds or testing stages.'
        D: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used to compile Go source files. The `-D` flag is a compiler flag that disables the generation of Go documentation (also known as "godoc" or just "doc") during compilation. This means that when you use this flag, the `go doc` command will not produce any output for the affected package(s). The primary use case for this flag is to speed up the build process by omitting the generation of unnecessary documentation files.'
        E: '[AI] `go-tool-compile -E` is a command in Go programming language, specifically the `gocompile` tool. The `-E` flag stands for "electronic assembly" or "preprocessor only." It instructs the compiler to perform only the preprocessing stage of compiling Go source code. Preprocessing includes handling directives like `#include`, macros expansion, and other textual transformations. After preprocessing, no further compilation stages like syntax analysis, semantic checking, or code generation are performed. This flag is useful for inspecting the output of preprocessing without dealing with later errors that may occur during compilation.'
        I: '[AI] The `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used for compilation. The option `-I` (uppercase I) followed by a directory path is used to specify additional include directories. This means that the compiler will look for header files (`.h`, `.g`, or plain text files) in those directories when resolving imports besides the standard library and any imported packages.'
        K: '[AI] `go-tool-compile -K` is a command used in Go programming language for generating compilation artifacts, also known as builder files or go.mod files. This specific form of the `go compile` command doesn''t actually build or run the code; instead it only creates or updates these dependency metadata files based on the current state of your project''s `go.mod` file. In summary, it performs a "clean" compilation that generates or updates the necessary metadata files.'
        L: '[AI] The `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language. The `-L` flag, when used with this tool, is responsible for producing a list of packages and their dependencies that are required to build or run the given Go source code. It does not perform any compilation or linking; it simply prints out the required packages along with their import paths as output. This information can be useful in understanding the dependencies of a Go project and resolving missing imports during development or building a Go application.'
        "N": '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool used in the Go programming language for compiling Go source code. The `-N` flag is an option that can be passed to this command. It stands for "no-link" or "no-build". When using this flag, the compiler will only check for syntax errors and compile each file into bytecode without linking it together with other files to create an executable binary. This can be useful during development when you want to quickly check if your code is syntactically correct and if individual Go source files are compiling without issues before attempting to build the entire project.'
        S: '[AI] `go-tool-compile -S` is a command provided by Go''s `govbuild` or `go` toolchain for generating Go source code from `.go` files into `.go` or `.s` (assembly) files respectively. The `-S` flag signifies that the output should be assembly files instead of compiled binary files. This is particularly useful in cases where you want to analyze or modify the generated assembly code for a better understanding of the Go compiler''s optimization or intrinsic functions usage.'
        V: '[AI] `go-tool-compile -V` is a command used in the Go programming language to check for the version of the `gocompile` tool. The `-V` (short for verbose) flag instructs the tool to print out its version number when executed, providing information about the Go compiler''s major.minor.patch release and any additional build metadata if available.'
        W: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language used to compile Go source code. The `-W` flag enables compiler warnings. When you run `go-tool-compile` with this option, it will report any potential issues or suggestions for improvement in your code that don''t necessarily cause errors but can lead to unexpected behavior or poor performance. It helps developers catch potential problems early and improve the overall quality of their code.'
        asan: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library used for compilation. The `-asan` flag enables Address Sanitizer (ASAN) during the build process. ASAN is a memory error detector, adding it to the compilation process results in binary code that can detect and report errors related to buffer overflows, use after free, and other memory-related issues at runtime.'
        asmhdr: '[AI] `go-tool-compile -asmhdr` is a command-line tool in Go programming language that generates an assembly header file for the specified Go source file. It''s used to create a raw assembler input file with necessary information like section names and symbol declarations, which can be further processed by low-level assemblers or linkers. It''s typically used when writing Go code that interacts directly with assembly language code or hardware.'
        bench: '[AI] `go-tool-compile -bench` is a command used in Go programming language to compile and run benchmarks for Go source files. Benchmarks are code snippets designed to measure the performance of specific parts of your code. When you run `go-tool-compile -bench`, the Go compiler not only compiles the source code but also generates and runs the benchmark tests. The result is a detailed report on the performance of the measured functions or code blocks, including the number of iterations, CPU time, and memory allocations.'
        blockprofile: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in Go programming language''s standard library, used to compile Go source code. The `-blockprofile` flag enables the generation of block profiles during compilation. Block profiling gathers detailed CPU usage data for individual functions and basic blocks within those functions. This information can be used for more accurate analysis of performance hotspots in the code. The resulting profile files are written in the CPUslices format, which can be further processed by other tools like `pprof` or visualization tools like the Go standard library''s `plotcpuprofile` command.'
        buildid: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, used for compiling Go source code into executable binaries or shared libraries. The `-buildid` flag generates a unique build identifier that is appended to the output file name and included in the binary or library''s metadata. This can be useful for versioning and tracking builds within a continuous integration or deployment pipeline.'
        c: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language ecosystem, specifically used for compilation of Go source code. The `-c` flag stands for "compile only," meaning that it instructs the compiler to perform just the compilation step without running any tests or generating test coverage reports. The resulting output from the command will be an executable file or shared library (depending on the context) ready for use in a Go application.'
        clobberdead: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from Go programming language''s standard library. The `-clobberdead` option is used to remove previously compiled object files (with suffix ".o") that are no longer needed, even if they have timestamps older than the corresponding source files. This can help save disk space and ensure consistent builds by starting from a clean slate each time you build your Go project.'
        clobberdeadreg: |-
            [AI] The `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language used to compile Go source code into executable binaries or shared libraries. The `-clobberdeadreg` flag is an optional argument passed to this tool for cleaning dead registers during compilation.

            When the Go compiler encounters unused variables, it will not generate code for them, and they are considered as "dead" in the context of the function they belong to. Dead registers are those that have no side effects on the program's outcome and contain only constant or unused values.

            The `-clobberdeadreg` flag instructs the compiler to eliminate these dead registers from the generated machine code to reduce code size and improve performance, as these registers won't be used during runtime. In essence, it's an optimization that helps save memory by removing unused register space.
        complete: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, used for compiling Go source code into executables or object files. The `-complete` flag is an optional argument that enables the interactive completion feature for the Godelint and godoc tools when using the Go IDE or text editors with Go support, such as Visual Studio Code. This flag enhances the development experience by providing suggestions for function calls, identifiers, and import paths while typing in the editor.'
        coveragecfg: '[AI] The `go-tool-compile` flag `-coveragecfg` is used with the Go programming language to generate a coverage configuration file for use with the `gcov` tool or other third-party profiling tools. This file specifies the input source files and the corresponding output data files for storing and analyzing code coverage information during testing. The generated coverage data can be later used to measure and report statistics about which lines, branches, and functions were executed during tests, aiding in identifying untested or under-tested areas of the codebase.'
        cpuprofile: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, used for various compile-related tasks. The specific usage `go-tool-compile -cpuprofile` generates or updates a CPU profile file during program execution. This file (with the extension `.cpuprof`) records detailed information about which parts of the code were executing at each point in time, helping to identify performance bottlenecks when analyzed with profiling tools like `pprof`.'
        d: '[AI] The `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in the Go programming language used for compilation of Go source code. The `-d` flag, when passed to this tool, instructs it to only produce the compiled Go object files (`.o` or `.a`) instead of executing the linker and generating an executable or shared library. This can be useful during development stages, for instance, when testing individual components or libraries without creating unnecessary output files.'
        dwarf: |-
            [AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language's standard library, used for various compilation tasks. The `-dwarf` flag is an option passed to this tool which enables the generation of DWARF (Debugging Information in the Dwarf Format) debug information alongside the compiled binary or object files.

            DWARF debug info enhances the functionality of a debugger by providing more precise and detailed information about the source code, variables, functions, and their relationships during execution. This is essential for effective debugging and reverse engineering.
        dwarfbasentries: '[AI] The `go-tool-compile` command is a part of Google''s Go programming language toolchain. When used with the `-dwarf` option followed by `-ebenaries`, it generates DWARF debug information entry files (`.dbg`) from compiled Go source code. These files are essential for debugging executables or libraries at the source level in a detailed manner within a debugger. They contain comprehensive information about variables, functions, and their relationships, among other things. So, this specific command is used to produce such debug information entries in DWARF format.'
        dwarflocationlists: |-
            [AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language's standard library, used for compiling Go source code. The `-dwarflocationlists` flag modifies the output of the compilation process.

            DWARF (Debugging Information in the Words) is a debugging information format used by many C and C++ compilers. It provides detailed information about program structure, variables, and function calls, which is essential for effective debugging. The location lists specifically refer to tables in DWARF files that contain exact source code addresses corresponding to each compiled instruction or statement.

            When using the `go-tool-compile` with the `-dwarflocationlists` flag, it instructs the compiler to include detailed location information (i.e., location lists) within the generated DWARF debugging data. This results in more comprehensive debugging information for the Go code, enabling better error tracking and understanding of the program execution flow when using a suitable debugger.
        dynlink: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, used to compile Go source code into executable binary files or shared libraries. The `-dynlink` flag is an optional argument for this tool. When used, it instructs the linker to perform dynamic linking of specified shared libraries at runtime instead of statically linking them during compilation. This means that the required libraries are loaded and linked to the executable at run time, allowing for easier management of dependencies and potential updates to shared library components.'
        e: '[AI] `go-tool-compile -e` is a command used in Go programming language for compiling and running a Go source file as a single executable binary, without creating a separate directory for the project or maintaining a Go.mod file. The `-e` flag stands for "embed" and it also embeds any specified files into the binary to make them part of the executable itself. This is particularly useful when developing small, standalone applications or scripts.'
        embedcfg: '[AI] `go-tool-compile -embedcfg` is a command provided by Go language''s `go` tool. It generates an embedded Go configuration file for embedding files directly into Go binaries using the `-embed` flag during compilation. By running `go-tool-compile -embedcfg <file.go> -o output.cfg`, it creates a config file (output.cfg) that lists all the files to be embedded, which can then be referred in build tag in the Go source code using `// +build embed`. This feature helps reduce binary size and simplify dependency management for small projects.'
        gendwarfinl: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language. The `-gendwarfinl` option generates intermediate object files in DWARF format for debugging information. It''s used during the build process to ensure that proper debug data is included when developing and testing code.'
        goversion: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in the Go programming language used for compiling Go source code into executable binary files or shared libraries. The `-goversion` option specifies the Go version to use when building the project. This ensures that the build process uses the same Go version across all builds and prevents potential compatibility issues between different versions. For example, `go-tool-compile -goversion go1.16` would instruct the tool to compile using Go version 1.16.'
        h: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, used for generating standalone binaries or shared libraries from Go source code. The `-h` flag (short for `--help`) is an option that displays detailed help information about how to use this tool effectively. When you run `go-tool-compile -h`, it will print out the usage and available flags with a brief description for each. It''s a common practice among command-line tools to provide a `--help` flag, which allows users to quickly learn about the options available without having to consult external documentation or remember complex usage patterns.'
        importcfg: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used for compilation tasks. The `-importcfg` flag is an option for this tool. When used, it generates import statistics and writes the result into a file named `go.sum` or `go.mod.lock`, depending on whether you''re using the `go.mod` or `go.sum` file for dependency management in your project. These files are essential for reproducible builds by tracking the exact versions of imported dependencies that were used when the file was generated.'
        installsuffix: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used to compile source code into executable binaries or shared libraries. The `-installsuffix` flag is an option for this tool that specifies the suffix to be appended to the installed package name when using the `go get` command. This can help avoid conflicts with other packages having the same base name but different versions in the `$GOPATH`. For instance, `-installsuffix _v0.1.0` would result in a package being installed as `mypackage_v0.1.0`.'
        j: '[AI] The `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, used to compile Go source files into executable binaries or shared libraries. The `-j` flag is an optional argument passed to this command for specifying parallel processing. With `-j N`, where N is a positive integer, the compilation process will use up to N processes in parallel, potentially reducing build times on multi-core systems.'
        json: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in the Go programming language used for compiling Go source code into executable binary files or shared libraries. The `-json` flag is an optional argument that instructs the compiler to output the compilation process as JSON data instead of the default behavior, which is to produce the compiled binary or error messages. This option can be useful for automated build systems and continuous integration tools that require detailed information about the compilation process.'
        l: '[AI] `go-tool-compile -l` is a command used in Go programming language to list all the files that will be compiled when using the `go compile` or `go build` commands. The `-l` flag stands for "list" and its purpose is to provide a summary of the files to be compiled, without actually compiling them. This can be useful for understanding which files are required to build a specific target in your Go project.'
        linkobj: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in the Go programming language used for compilation. The `-linkobj` flag is an optional argument that instructs the compiler to produce an object file instead of a regular binary output. In other words, it generates an intermediate .o file(s) containing assembled machine code and symbol table information from the source files passed as arguments. This can be useful for linking multiple compilation units manually or for further processing by other tools.'
        linkshared: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used for compiling Go source code into executable binaries or object files. The `-linkshared` flag is an optional argument passed to this tool, which instructs it to create shared libraries instead of static ones during linking. In simpler terms, when using the `-linkshared` flag, Go will generate a dynamic library that can be loaded and linked at runtime by other programs, rather than a self-contained executable or static library. This is particularly useful when building large, complex applications where code reuse and sharing are desired across multiple components.'
        live: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used for compilation tasks. The `-live` flag is an option that can be passed to this command for performing a live recompilation of packages. This means that when you make changes to your source files, the Go compiler will automatically rebuild and update the affected binaries or libraries without needing to manually trigger a build process. It''s particularly useful during development when making frequent modifications.'
        m: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language. The `-m` flag, short for `-main`, specifies the Go source file that contains the `main()` function, which is the program''s entry point when run. When used with `go-tool-compile`, it compiles only the specified file and any dependencies required to build that file.'
        memprofile: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, used to compile Go source code. The `-memprofile` option generates a memory profile during program execution. This profile contains detailed information about the application''s memory usage, including memory allocations and deallocations, heap size, and object sizes. The resulting file can be analyzed using external profiling tools or integrated with popular IDEs for further optimization of Go applications.'
        memprofilerate: |-
            [AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language used for compiling Go source code into executable files or shared libraries. The `-memprofrate` option is related to memory profiling during compilation.

            When set, this option instructs the compiler to generate a memory profile at the specified sampling rate (in Hz). The resulting `.cpuprof` and `.memprof` files can be used by other tools like `pprof` for further analysis of the program's memory usage patterns.
        msan: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, used for compiling Go source code into executable binaries or shared libraries. The `-msan` flag is an option for enabling Memory Safety Analyzer (MSAN), which is a built-in static analyzer in Go that checks for potential memory safety issues during compilation. It helps detect and prevent errors related to buffer overflows, use-after-free, double free, and other memory-related bugs, making the code more secure and robust.'
        mutexprofile: |-
            [AI] The `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language's standard library, used for compiling Go source code into executables or shared libraries. The `-mutexprofile` flag generates a mutex profile during compilation. A mutex (short for "mutual exclusion") is a synchronization primitive used to control access to a critical section of code and prevent data races.

            With the `-mutexprofile` flag, Go compiler produces a profiling information about the mutual exclusion locks used in the program. This profile data can be later processed by other tools like `pprof` or `perftools` to analyze lock contention and provide insights into multithreading performance issues.
        nolocalimports: '[AI] The `go-tool-compile` command with the `-nolocalimports` flag is used in Go programming language for compiling source files without using any locally imported packages that are not present in the Go standard library or in the current project''s `GOPATH`. This can be useful when trying to ensure consistency across different environments, as it forces the compilation to only use officially supported packages. The flag prevents the usage of any local packages that have not been installed or imported using a non-standard method.'
        o: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used for compilation. The option `-o output` specifies the name of the output file where the compiled binary or object code will be saved after the build process. So, `go-tool-compile -o outputFileName programName.go` compiles the source file `programName.go` and saves the resulting binary or object code as `outputFileName`.'
        oldcomparable: |-
            [AI] The `go-tool-compile` command with the flag `-oldcompareble` is a part of Go programming language's `go` toolset. This flag is used during compilation to enable the usage of older comparison operators, specifically `<-`, `<=` and `>=` for receiving in channels instead of the newer syntax using `receive <- chan`.

            Using this flag helps maintain compatibility with older Go code while upgrading your toolchain or Go version. It is essential when working on projects that rely on the old comparison operators for their functionality and may not be ready to adopt the new syntax yet.
        p: '[AI] The `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used for compilation of Go source files into executable binary or object files. The `-p` flag, when passed to this tool, instructs it to only perform a partial compilation of the specified Go source files without linking them into an executable. This means that each file will be compiled into its corresponding object file but no linking will occur. This can be useful for building large projects in stages or for performing incremental builds.'
        pack: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language ecosystem, specifically used for compilation tasks. The `-pack` flag modifies the behavior of this tool to perform package-level builds instead of building a single Go source file. When using this flag, `go-tool-compile` will recursively build and pack all the required Go packages into a single executable or shared library. This is particularly useful for creating standalone binary distributions.'
        pgoprofile: '[AI] The `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used for compilation of Go source files into executable binary or object files. The `-pgprof` flag passed to this tool enables the generation of profiling data during the compilation process using the pprof profiling tool. This profiling information can then be analyzed to identify performance bottlenecks and memory issues in the code.'
        r: '[AI] The `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool used in Go programming language for compiling Go source files into executable binary or object files. The `-r` flag stands for "rebuild." When using this flag, go-tool will rebuild all the dependent packages before building the current package. In other words, it ensures that the most recent versions of all the dependencies are used during the compilation process.'
        race: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used for compilation tasks. The `-race` option enables the Race Detector during compilation. This detector helps find data races, which are concurrency issues where multiple goroutines access shared memory without proper synchronization, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior or deadlocks. By using `go-tool-compile -race`, you can identify and fix such issues in your Go code before running it in a production environment.'
        shared: '[AI] `go-tool-compile -shared` is a command provided by the Go programming language''s standard `go` tool. It compiles Go source files into shared libraries for various operating systems, such as .dll on Windows or .so on Unix-based systems. The `-shared` flag instructs the compiler to produce a shared library instead of an executable binary file. These shared libraries can then be loaded and used by other programs in the system, making them useful for writing reusable C go packages or building larger applications with multiple components.'
        smallframes: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, used for compiling Go source code into executable files or shared libraries. The `-smallframes` flag is an option that can be passed to this tool when invoking it for compilation. It instructs the Go compiler to use small frames in the generated machine code. This results in smaller stack frame sizes and thus saves memory at the expense of increased cache misses, which can potentially lead to a performance trade-off.'
        spectre: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, used for compiling Go source code into executables or shared libraries. The `-spectre` flag is an optional argument that enables interprocedural analysis during compilation with the project''s static analyzer named `go:tools/static`. It aims to detect potential security vulnerabilities and memory safety issues by analyzing the call graph and data flow across function boundaries within and between packages. Using this flag can help improve your codebase''s security and robustness.'
        std: '[AI] The `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used to compile Go source files into executable binary or object files. The `-std` flag is an option for this tool, specifying that the compilation should be done using only the standard library packages and without any non-standard packages. In other words, it compiles the code with only the built-in Go libraries, excluding any custom or third-party packages.'
        symabis: '[AI] The `go-tool-compile` command with the `-symabs` flag is used in Go programming language for generating and managing symbol tables (`.syms` files) for debugging shared libraries or Cgo projects. These symbol tables contain mapping information between names and addresses in memory, enabling debuggers to identify and inspect specific variables, functions, or other symbols during the debugging process. This flag is not typically used for day-to-day compilation and should be employed when working on more complex use cases involving shared libraries or Cgo projects that require advanced debugging capabilities.'
        t: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language ecosystem. The `-t` flag stands for "templates." When used with this flag, the `go-tool-compile` command compiles Go source code files into Go templates instead of generating an executable binary or object files. Go templates are precompiled Go code that can be evaluated at runtime using the `template` package. They''re often used for handling dynamic data in Go applications. The output of this command is a Go template file, which can then be used to generate output based on input data.'
        traceprofile: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library used for compilation of Go source code. The `-traceprofile` flag enables the generation of a tracing profile file during the build process. This file contains detailed runtime information about the execution of the program, including the number of times each function or method was called and the amount of time spent in each one. This data can be used for profiling and optimization purposes.'
        trimpath: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used for compiling Go source code. The `-trimpath` flag is an optional argument that modifies the output binary file name during the compilation process. Specifically, it removes the leading directory paths from imported packages'' names when generating the final binary. This results in shorter and more readable import paths in the generated binary for easier deployment and management.'
        v: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, used for compiling Go source code into executable binaries or object files. The `-v` flag, short for verbose, is an option that increases the amount of output provided during the compilation process. When used with `go-tool-compile`, it prints detailed information about each step of the build process, including the input and output files, the Go version being used, and any errors or warnings encountered. This can be helpful for debugging or understanding the compilation process in detail.'
        w: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, used for compilation of Go source code into executable binaries or object files. The `-w` flag stands for "write-to-files." When using this flag, the compiled output will be written to the specified file(s) instead of printing it to the standard output stream (stdout). This allows the generated binary or object file to overwrite an existing file or be saved in a specific location.'
        wb: '[AI] `go-tool-compile` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library. The `-wb` option passed to it stands for "write-to-bootfile." This flag instructs the compiler to produce a bootable binary file instead of an ordinary executable or object file. A bootable binary contains all necessary dependencies and can be run directly without further setup, making it useful in certain embedded systems development contexts.'
