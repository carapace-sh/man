    command: '[AI] `vagrant snapshot` is a Vagrant command used to create a point-in-time save of a Virtual Machine (VM) state in a Vagrant project. This includes the current configuration of the VM, its disk contents, and any data associated with the VM. The snapshot can later be reverted to using `vagrant restore` command, allowing you to easily roll back your VM to a previous state.'
