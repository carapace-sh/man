        [AI] The `docker trust` command is a sub-command under Docker's registry tool, not a standalone Docker command. It is used to manage trust relationships between registries in a Docker Hub organization.

        The `signer` action within the `docker trust` command creates or updates a signing key for an existing registry in your Docker Hub organization. The signing key can be used to sign images, ensuring their authenticity and integrity when they are pushed to or pulled from a registry within your organization. This is useful for securing image distribution within a team or organization by adding an additional layer of verification beyond just checking the image metadata.
