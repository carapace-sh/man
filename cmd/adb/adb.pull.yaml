    command: '[AI] `adb pull` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to transfer files or directories from an Android device to the local machine. The syntax is as follows: `adb pull <device>:<path> <local-path>`. Here, `<device>:<path>` represents the source file or directory path on the connected Android device and `<local-path>` indicates the destination location on the local computer. When you run this command, ADB will establish a secure connection and initiate the file transfer over that connection. Once completed, the specified file or folder from your Android device will be copied to your local system.'
    flag:
        Z: |-
            [AI] `adb pull` is a command-line tool that comes with the Android Debug Bridge (ADB), which allows you to communicate with and manage your Android device from the command line. The `pull` subcommand is used to transfer files or directories from the device to the host machine.

            The option `-Z` (or `--size`) is used with the `pull` command to display the size of each file as it is being transferred, in a human-readable format (e.g., "10M" for 10 megabytes). So, `adb pull <device>:<path> <local_path> -Z` would transfer a file or directory from the device to the local machine while displaying the size of each file as it is being transferred.
        a: '[AI] `adb pull -a` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) which is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device. The `pull` sub-command is used to retrieve files from an Android device. The `-a` flag stands for "all", meaning this command will retrieve all files and directories from the device''s root directory, recursively, and save them in the current local directory on your system where ADB is run. It''s a convenient way to quickly copy the entire content of an Android device to your local machine.'
        z: '[AI] `adb pull` is a command-line tool that comes with the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) suite for transferring files between an Android device and a computer. The `-z` option stands for "zero-size file" mode. When used with `pull`, this option instructs ADB to create an empty local file with the same name as the remote file or directory being pulled, without actually downloading its content. This can be useful when checking if a remote file exists before attempting a larger data transfer.'
