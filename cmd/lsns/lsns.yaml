    command: '[AI] The `lsns` command is not a standard Unix or Linux command. It seems to be specific to IBM AIX operating system. The `lsns` command displays information about currently active System Services and their associated process identifiers (PIDs). The output includes the service name, PID, state, and other details. This command can be useful for troubleshooting issues related to system services in an AIX environment.'

        help: |-
            [AI] `lsns` is a Linux command used to list System Namespace Isolations (LSNs), which are containers for namespaces in the Linux kernel. The `--help` option provides a brief summary of how to use this command:

            ```text
            Usage: lsns [OPTIONS] [PID|NAME]...

            List System Namespaces and their current processes, or filter by PID or name.

            Options:
              --all                    List all namespaces, not just the one of the given PID/NAME
              -a, --array              Print a list in JSON array format
              -h, --help               Display this help and exit
              -j, --json               Print a list in JSON format
              -l, --long               Use a long listing format
              -p, --pid NUM            List the namespaces of the process with the given PID
              -n, --name NAME          List the processes within the namespace with the given name
            ```

            The `lsns` command can be used to list either the namespaces for a specific process (by providing its PID) or the processes within a given namespace. The `--help` option provides details on these usage cases and lists available options to customize output formats.
        json: '[AI] `lsns --json` is a Linux command used to list Linux Security Modules (LSM) instances and their attached labels in JSON format. It''s part of the `lsns` utility, which stands for "Linux Security Module Namespace". This command helps in getting a more structured output that can be easily parsed or processed further with JSON tools, providing better programmatic access to LSM information.'
        list: '[AI] `lsns --list` is a Linux command used to list currently activated namespaces in the system. Namespaces provide isolation for various system resources such as UID/GID, network, and interprocess communication between processes. The output of this command shows the type and ID of each active namespace.'
        noheadings: '[AI] `lsns --noheadings` is a Linux command used to list Linux Security Modules (LSM) instances and their attached labels. The `--noheadings` option suppresses the display of column headers, resulting in an output that only contains data. This can be useful when processing the output programmatically or for comparing the output of multiple commands.'
        notruncate: '[AI] The `lsns --notruncate` command is a Linux kernel command used to list Security Contexts (SCs) in the Linux Security Module (LSM) subsystem, specifically for the SELinux LSM. The `--notruncate` option prevents the output from being truncated to fit within a single terminal screen. This allows the entire output to be displayed without being cut off. The command shows detailed information about each SC, such as its name, type, context, and flags. It is useful for debugging SELinux issues or for gaining insight into the system''s security configuration.'
        nowrap: '[AI] The `lsns --nowrap` command is a Linux system administration command used to list security contexts in the Linux Security Module (LSM) subsystem. The `--nowrap` option is used to prevent long lines from being wrapped when displayed on the terminal, ensuring that the output remains readable and is not truncated.'
        output: '[AI] `lsns --output` is a Linux command used to list System Call Table (SCT) entries, which map system calls to their corresponding Linux Security Module (LSM) hooks. The `--output` option specifies the output format: it can be set to "json" for JSON output or "csv" for comma-separated values. This command provides detailed information about how LSMs interact with system calls, which is useful for advanced security analysis and troubleshooting.'
        output-all: '[AI] `lsns` is a Linux command-line utility used to list the namespaces and their associated processes. The `--output-all` option is used to display all available columns of output. These columns include namespace type, PID (Process ID), comm (command name), and other relevant information related to the namespace and associated process. In summary, using `lsns --output-all` will display a comprehensive list of all namespaces and their associated processes with detailed information.'
        raw: '[AI] `lsns --raw` is a Linux command used to list Linux Security Modules (LSM) current configurations in a raw format. It provides detailed information about the current state of various LSM interfaces, including their names, types, and current settings. The output can be helpful for debugging or understanding how different security policies are being applied on a system.'
        task: '[AI] The `lsns` command with the `--task` option is a Linux kernel command-line tool used to list the tasks or processes associated with a specific Linux Security Module (LSM) subsystem or namespace. This can be helpful for debugging and understanding how different LSMs interact with running tasks in the system. The output of this command includes the task PID, process name, and the LSM subsystem or namespace to which it belongs.'
        type: '[AI] `lsns --type` is a Linux command used to list Linux Security Modules (LSM) loaded in the kernel and their associated types or interfaces. It provides detailed information about the LSMs, including their names, interfaces, and current instances. The `--type` option filters the output to show only the specified type of LSMs. For instance, using `lsns --type=SELinux` will display information related to SELinux LSM.'
        version: '[AI] `lsns` is a Linux kernel command-line utility for managing namespaces in a system. The `--version` option is used to display the version information of the `lsns` utility itself, not the Linux kernel or any specific namespace. This includes the version number, compilation date, and other relevant build information.'
