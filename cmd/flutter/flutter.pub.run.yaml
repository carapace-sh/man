documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flutter pub run` is a command used in Flutter development to fetch and install new dependencies or update existing ones from the `pubspec.yaml` file, as defined in the project''s configuration. It interacts with the Flutter package manager, named `pub`, by executing the `get` subcommand, which downloads and saves the required packages to the `.dart_tool/flutter_tools/cache/artifacts` directory. This process ensures that the project has access to the latest dependencies for building and running the application.'
    flag:
        directory: '[AI] `flutter pub run` is a command used in Flutter development to fetch, compile, and install new packages or dependencies for a Flutter project from the public repository called pub.dev. The `--directory` option specifies the directory of the Flutter project where this command should be executed. It ensures that the correct path is set when interacting with the Flutter package manager, Pubspec.yaml file and the project''s dependencies.'
        enable-asserts: '[AI] `flutter pub run --enable-asserts` is a command used in Flutter development to enable assertions during the package get process. Assertions are checks that are built into the code to verify if a certain condition is met at runtime. By default, Flutter disables asserts for release builds to improve performance and reduce app size. However, enabling asserts during development can help catch potential bugs early by reporting useful error messages. Running this command fetches and installs new packages while ensuring that the asserts are enabled in the installed dependencies.'
        enable-experiment: '[AI] `flutter pub run --enable-experiment` is a command used in Flutter development to enable experimental features that are not yet stable and may contain bugs. These features can be accessed via the Flutter publication system by adding them as dependencies with the `--mode=develop` or `--project-env=flutter_dev` flag, followed by running the `pub get` command with the `--enable-experiment` flag. This allows developers to use and test experimental features before they are officially released, but it''s important to note that these features may change or break without notice.'
        help: '[AI] `flutter pub run --help` is a command used in Flutter development for interacting with the Flutter package manager, named `pub`. This specific command requests for help information about the `run` sub-command. It provides an overview of how to use `pub run` to execute tasks such as building, testing, or analyzing packages and their dependencies.'
        no-enable-asserts: '[AI] The `flutter pub run --no-enable-asserts` command is used to run a package installation or upgrade from the Flutter Pub package manager, without enabling assertions. Asserts are checks that can be enabled in the Flutter development environment to help catch potential issues during development. However, they add runtime overhead and are not necessary when building for production. By running this command, you can ensure that no asserts are enabled during the build process, resulting in a smaller binary size and improved performance.'
        no-sound-null-safety: '[AI] `flutter pub run --no-sound-null-safety` is a command used in Flutter development to install or update packages from the Pub specification file (pubspec.yaml) without enabling Null Safety. This option is passed to the flutter pub global tool to bypass the default null safety checks during package installation. It can be useful when dealing with legacy code or libraries that may not yet support Dart''s Null Safety feature.'
        sound-null-safety: |-
            [AI] `flutter pub run --no-safety` is a command used in Flutter development to bypass null safety checks during the publication of dependencies using the `pub` package manager. This command should be used only when you are sure that the dependencies do not have any null-safety issues and you want to avoid the time it takes for the null safety analysis to run during the pub get process.

            The `--sound-null-safety` flag specifically disables all warnings related to null safety, allowing the publication of packages even if they contain null safety issues. This can potentially lead to runtime errors and is generally discouraged as it goes against the goal of using Flutter's null safety feature to improve code robustness.

            Using this command may result in compatibility issues with other projects that enforce null safety checks, so it's recommended to use it only when necessary and to communicate any potential risks to consumers of your packages.
