documentation:
    command: '[AI] `supervisorctl signal` is a command used in Supervisor, a popular process monitoring tool. It allows users to send signals to specific processes managed by Supervisor, without having to directly interact with the processes themselves. The syntax is `supervisorctl signal [NAME] [SIGNAL]`, where "NAME" is the name of the process group or the process ID monitored by Supervisor, and "[SIGNAL]" is the signal name (e.g., "TERM", "RESTART", "USR1", etc.) that will be sent to the process. This command can be used to gracefully stop a process, restart it, or apply other signals depending on the user''s needs.'
