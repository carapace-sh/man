        [AI] The `yarn npm tag` command is not a valid Yarn or npm command. It seems like you may have combined elements from two different package managers unintentionally.

        In npm, the `tag` command is used to create or list tags for a specific package, which can be useful for managing different versions or releases of a package. For example, `npm tag my-package v1.0.0` would create or add the tag `v1.0.0` to the `my-package` package.

        However, Yarn does not have an equivalent command for tags as it uses its own data format and workflow which is different from npm. If you need to interact with npm tags within a Yarn workflow, consider using npm directly or setting up scripts in your `package.json` file to run npm commands.
