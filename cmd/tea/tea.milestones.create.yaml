documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea milestones create` command is used in the TEA (Test Automation Engine) tool to create a new milestone for a specific test run or release. A milestone represents a significant point in a project where progress can be measured and reported. By executing this command, you define a new milestone with an optional description, which helps in tracking the development and testing process more effectively.'
    flag:
        deadline: '[AI] The `--deadline` option in the Tea (Tiny Evolutionary Algorithm) framework''s `create` command sets a hard deadline for the optimization process. This means that the algorithm will stop running once it has found a solution that meets or exceeds the specified objective function value, regardless of whether the maximum number of generations or evaluations has been reached. The deadline is defined by providing a numeric value representing the desired objective function value.'
        description: '[AI] The `--description` option in the `tea milestones create` command is used to specify a detailed description for a new milestone in a Git project managed by Tectonic (Tea-as-a-Service). This description helps provide context and information about what will be accomplished during that milestone, making it easier for team members to understand the goals and progress of the project.'
        login: '[AI] `tea milestones create --login` is a command used in the Tectonic (now called OpenShift Online by Red Hat) platform for creating new continuous delivery (CD) pipelines or milestones, with login credentials included in the pipeline configuration. The `--login` flag signifies that a new OAuth token will be generated and added to the pipeline, enabling automated builds or deployments from external sources. This is particularly useful when integrating external source control systems or CI/CD tools into the Tectonic platform.'
        output: '[AI] The `tea milestones create` command is a sub-command under the TEA (Temporal Event Analysis) CLI tool in Kubernetes. This command creates a new Milestone custom resource object in the specified namespace and project, marking a significant point in the development or release process of an application. The `--output` flag specifies the format for the output of this command, which can be set to json (the default), yaml, or go-template. The output format allows the user to easily integrate the creation of Milestones into their automation workflows or scripts.'
        remote: '[AI] `tea milestones create --remote` is a command used in the Tectonic (Tea) platform, an open-source Kubernetes distribution by CoreOS. This command creates a new GitOps milestone in a remote Tectonic cluster using the GitOps workflow. The GitOps approach manages infrastructure as code, allowing users to easily track changes and rollbacks. With `--remote` flag, the change is pushed to the remote repository and applied automatically on the specified Kubernetes cluster.'
        repo: '[AI] The `tea milestones create` command with the `--repo` option is used in the TEA (Temporal Event Anderson) framework for creating a new Git repository and associating it with a specific milestone or release branch. This helps keep track of changes related to specific releases in a version control system. The `create` action creates a new milestone, while the `--repo` option specifies the Git repository where this milestone will be created.'
        state: '[AI] `tea milestones create --state` is a command in the TEA (Test Automation Engine) CLI tool for creating a new milestone with a specific state within the TEA Milestones system. The `--state` option specifies the desired state for the newly created milestone, which could be "To Do," "In Progress," or "Done." This command helps in managing and tracking the progress of testing tasks or projects within the TEA framework.'
        title: '[AI] The `tea milestones create` command with the `--title` option is used in the Jenkins Continuous Integration (CI) tool to create a new Milestone within a Jenkins project. A Milestone is a label or identifier that represents a specific goal or set of features that are being developed, tested, and deployed as part of a larger software development effort. The `--title` option sets the descriptive name or title for the Milestone that is being created.'
