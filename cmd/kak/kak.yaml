documentation:
    command: '[AI] The term "kak" doesn''t have a standard meaning in computing or technology as it is not a recognized command or function in any common operating system, programming language, or software application. It appears to be non-sensical without additional context.'
    flag:
        E: '[AI] The `kak` flag `-E` is used in the `ksh` (Korn Shell) to enable the interpretation of backslashes (\) as escape characters within quotes. This allows quoting special characters or escaping meta-characters while preserving whitespace. For example, ''-E'' can be useful when handling filenames with spaces or special characters.'
        c: '[AI] The `kak` command with the option `-c` (or `--create`) is used to create a new text file in the KAK (Keep A Kids) editor. It opens an editor session where you can input the content for the new file, and once saved, it will be created at the specified location.'
        clear: '[AI] The `kak` flag `--clear` is a command used in the text editor Kakoune to clear the screen or the current buffer. When executed, it wipes out all the contents of the active window and sets the cursor back to its original position at the top-left corner. This can be useful for starting fresh when editing a large file or to hide sensitive information from casual glances.'
        d: '[AI] The `kak` flag `-d` is used in Kakoune, a text editor written in the C programming language. This option sets Kakoune to run in terminal mode, which means it will read input from and write output to the terminal instead of opening a graphical user interface window.'
        e: '[AI] The `kak-e` flag is a command-line option used in Perl, specifically with the `ksh` (Korn Shell) compatibility layer of Perl. It stands for "Korn-like array subscripting," and it allows users to access arrays using negative indexes or ranges, as is common in Korn shell scripts. For example, `$array[-1]` refers to the last element in the array, and `$array[1,3,5]` refers to the elements at indices 1, 3, and 5. Without this flag, Perl would return an error when attempting such indexing.'
        f: '[AI] The `kubectl` `kak` command with the flag `-f` is used to apply a Kubernetes manifest file directly. This means that the YAML or JSON file contains the desired state for Kubernetes resources, and using this flag will make `kubectl` create or update those resources accordingly. The flag `--validate=false` can be added if you want to skip the validation step, which may be useful when applying a file with known errors for testing purposes.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `kak` is a command-line tool for interactively searching and manipulating files in a project or directory. The `--help` option displays usage information about `kak` and its available options.

            Here's a brief summary of the help output:

            1. `kak [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE]`: This is the basic command structure, where `OPTIONS` define various search options (like case sensitivity, regular expressions, etc.), `PATTERN` is the search term, and `FILE` represents an optional file or directory to limit the search scope.
            2. Available options include: `-i`, ignore case; `-r`, recursive search; `-g`, search in gitignored files; `--follow`, follow symlinks; `--help`, display help information.
            3. Search results can be manipulated using various commands, such as editing the file with an external editor, copying or deleting it, among others.
        i: '[AI] The `kak-i` flag is a command-line option used in some Unix-like operating systems, including Kali Linux. It stands for "keep old" and is often used with text editors such as `nano` or `vim`. When this option is specified, the original file is not overwritten during saving changes, instead, a new file with a suffix _old is created. For example, when saving with `vim -i --kak <filename>`, it will create a backup file named <filename>\_old. This helps in maintaining multiple versions of the same file.'
        l: '[AI] The `kak` command with the flag `-l` is a part of the Kakoune text editor. This flag is used to list all open buffers in the current session of Kakoune. It provides a brief overview of each buffer, including its name and modification status. This information helps users navigate between their open files and manage their editing tasks efficiently.'
        "n": '[AI] The `kak` flag with the option `-n` in Unix-like operating systems is used in the `history` command. It stands for "only show the most recent `N` lines" in the command history. So, if you type `history -n 5`, it will display only the last five commands in your history list.'
        p: '[AI] The `kak` command with the option `-p` is a text editor for the KDE desktop environment in Linux and Unix systems. The `-p` flag stands for "split view," which splits the terminal window into two parts, each showing a different buffer or file. This configuration allows users to edit multiple files side by side within the same editing session.'
        q: '[AI] The `kak` command with the `-q` flag is a terminal-based text editor used in the KDE desktop environment. The `-q` option stands for "quiet mode," which means that it runs the editor without displaying any messages or progress indicators during its execution. This can be useful when running scripts or automating tasks where unnecessary output may interfere with other processes.'
        ro: '[AI] The "Kak-ro" flag is a Korean Agility Team flag, specifically used by the South Korean agility team in various international competitions. The name "Kak-ro" is derived from the Korean words "Kak" meaning red and "Ro" meaning big or great, reflecting the team''s spirit and determination. The design on the flag typically includes the agility jumper logo and the team name written in Hanja characters, symbolizing their unity and passion for the sport.'
        s: '[AI] The `kak` flag `-s` is used in Kakoune, a text editor written in the C programming language, to start the editor in server mode. In this mode, Kakoune runs as a background process and accepts connections from clients that can edit and save files through it. This flag is useful for setting up a text editing environment where multiple users or processes can collaboratively edit files over a network.'
        ui: '[AI] The "Kak-ui" flag is not a widely recognized international or national flag. It appears to be specific to the Kachin ethnic group in Myanmar (Burma). The design of this flag is simple: it consists of a white field with three horizontal stripes, each representing one of the main subgroups of the Kachin people. The central stripe is red, symbolizing unity and bravery, while the two outer stripes are blue, representing purity and protection. The name "Kak-ui" translates to ''strong'' or ''powerful'' in the Kachin language.'
        version: '[AI] `kak` is a text-based file manager for the KDE desktop environment. The command `kak --version` is used to display the version information of the installed `kak` application, including its name, version number, and compilation date. This can be helpful in checking if you have the latest version or not, troubleshooting issues, or ensuring compatibility with other software.'
