    command: '[AI] The `help` command in Git is used to display help messages about various Git commands and their usage. The `soft` modifier before `help` in the command `soft help` is not a valid option for this command. There is no such command as `soft help` in Git. If you meant to use just the `help` command, it will display information about the Git command that is currently active in your terminal session or can be used with the name of a specific Git command to display its usage and available options.'
