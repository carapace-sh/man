    command: '[AI] The `yarn plugin import from` command is not a built-in Yarn command, but rather a feature provided by some Yarn plugins. It is used to import and register modules or dependencies as plugins within your Yarn workflow. The syntax typically looks like this: `yarn plugin import <plugin-name> from <module-url>`. This command downloads the plugin and adds it to your `node_modules` directory, then configures Yarn to use it based on the plugin''s documentation. For more information about a specific plugin, refer to its official documentation.'
