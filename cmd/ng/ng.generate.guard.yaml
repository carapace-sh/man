documentation:
    command: '[AI] `ng generate guard` is a command used in Angular applications to create a new Guard. Guards are Angular services that intercept and can modify or completely prevent navigation to specified routes based on certain conditions, such as authentication status. This command generates a new guard file with the specified name and sets up the necessary file structure and imports for you.'
    flag:
        flat: '[AI] `ng generate guard --flat` is a command used in Angular applications to generate a new Angular guard with the `--flat` option specified. This option means that only the necessary files for the guard will be generated, without creating a new component, container, or feature module. The result is a minimal guard setup, containing only the necessary files such as the guard class and its corresponding testing file.'
        implements: '[AI] `ng generate guard --implements` is a command used in Angular to create a new guard with a pre-defined implementation, such as CanActivate, CanDeactivate, or BeforeGuards. The `--implements` flag specifies the guard type and provides a base implementation for common guard functionalities. This simplifies the process of creating guards and reduces development time.'
        project: '[AI] The `ng generate guard` command is used to create a new Angular guard in your Angular project. A guard is a type of Angular service that can be used to protect routes, guards check for certain conditions before activating a route and can prevent unauthorized access. The `--project` option specifies the name of the existing Angular project where you want to create the new guard. This command creates a new TypeScript file with the desired guard functionality, as well as updates the necessary configuration files within your Angular application.'
        skip-tests: '[AI] `ng generate guard --skip-tests` is a command used with the Angular CLI to create a new guard without generating test files. Guards are Angular components that intercept and modify or completely prevent navigation to certain routes based on various conditions. By including `--skip-tests`, the command will not create corresponding test files (e.g., `guard.spec.ts`) for the newly generated guard, which can save development time if manual testing is preferred.'
