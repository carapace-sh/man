description: Rename a file in a gist
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `gh` command with the `gist rename` sub-command is used to rename a GitHub Gist. This command requires you to authenticate with your GitHub account using the `gh` CLI tool. Once authenticated, you provide the current gist ID or username and the new name as arguments. The command sends an HTTP PUT request to update the gist metadata, thereby renaming it on GitHub.'
