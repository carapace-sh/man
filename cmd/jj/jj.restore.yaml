    command: '[AI] The `jj restore` command is used in JetBrains DataGrip, a database tool, to restore a previously saved database snapshot or backup. This action recreates the exact state of the database as it was when the snapshot was taken, allowing users to easily revert changes made since then.'
    flag:
        changes-in: '[AI] The `jj restore --changes-in` command is used in Git''s interactive rebase tool (`jj`) to restore specific changes that were previously staged or commited during an ongoing rebasing session. The `--changes-in` option shows the differences between the current and the parent commits for each changed file, allowing you to review and selectively apply or discard individual hunks of code changes. This can be useful when resolving merge conflicts or reworking commits in a more fine-grained way during an interactive rebase.'

            [AI] The `jj restore --from` command is used in Jumpbox's Jumpstart tool to restore a previous version of a configuration file or directory. Here's a brief explanation:

            * `restore`: This is the main action being taken with this command. It means that Jumpstart will attempt to undo any changes made to the configuration since the last save point or backup.
            * `--from`: This option tells Jumpstart which save point or backup to restore from. It can be a specific revision number, a branch name, or a tag name depending on how Jumpstart's version control system is configured.
        help: '[AI] `jj restore --help` is a command used in Juju, a service orchestration tool for managing applications and services across multiple clouds and clusters. This command displays the help information for the ''restore'' sub-command of Juju''s ''jj'' CLI (Command Line Interface). It explains how to use this command to restore previously saved application or model states from a Charmstore or other storage backends. Options include specifying a particular revision, the target environment, and the name of the application or model to be restored.'
        to: '[AI] `jj restore --to` is a command in Jumpbox''s Jumpstart terminal automation tool. This command restores previously saved terminal sessions to their previous state, allowing users to quickly recover sessions instead of starting from scratch. The `--to` flag specifies the target session identifier or index to which the restoration should be applied.'
