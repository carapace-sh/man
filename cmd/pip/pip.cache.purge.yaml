documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pip cache purge` is a command used in Python programming language to clear the local cache of packages managed by pip, which is a popular package installer for Python. When you run this command, it deletes all cached packages and their related metadata files from the `~/.cache/pip` directory (on Unix-based systems) or `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Cache\pip` (on Windows), freeing up disk space. Using this command can be useful when you want to ensure that only the latest versions of packages are installed, or if you encounter issues related to corrupted cached files.'
