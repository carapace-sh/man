documentation:
    command: '[AI] `qmk lint` is a command used in the QMK keyboard firmware project to perform a static analysis check on a keyboard project''s source code. It identifies potential issues such as unused variables or keys, missing includes, and other coding mistakes. This helps ensure that the keyboard firmware functions correctly and efficiently. The output provides suggestions for resolving any issues found.'

            Using this information, you can run `qmk lint --help` in your terminal or command prompt to learn more about how to use the tool for checking your QMK firmware code for potential errors and inconsistencies.
        keyboard: '[AI] `qmk lint --keyboard` is a command used in the QMK keyboard firmware project to perform static analysis on a given QMK keyboard layout or configuration file. The `--keyboard` option specifies that only the keyboard-specific rules will be applied during the linting process, which helps ensure the correctness and consistency of the keyboard layout, improve readability, and catch potential errors before compilation.'
        keymap: '[AI] `qmk lint --keymap` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project to perform a syntax check on a custom keymap file written in QMK format. The command invokes QMK''s linting tool, which scans the specified keymap file for errors or inconsistencies related to its structure and syntax, ensuring it follows the proper rules and conventions set by the QMK community. This helps maintain code quality and compatibility with other parts of the keyboard firmware.'
        strict: '[AI] `qmk lint --strict` is a command used in the QMK keyboard firmware project to check the syntax and style of Keyboard Firmware (QMK) source code files. The `--strict` flag enables stricter error checking, causing the tool to report not only compile errors but also potential issues that may lead to errors during compilation or usage. It''s a useful tool for ensuring code quality and maintaining consistency within the project.'
