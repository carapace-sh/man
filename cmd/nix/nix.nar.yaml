    command: '[AI] `nix nar` is a Nix expression that creates a new archive (nar) file from existing Nix expressions or packages. It takes a list of paths to Nix expressions or packages as its argument and generates a new Nar info hash, which can be used for building, caching, and sharing Nix packages. The resulting Nar file encapsulates the build dependencies and environment variables, ensuring consistent builds across different systems.'
