name: cleanup-node
description: Run cleanup node.
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path to the directory where the certificates are stored. If specified, clean this directory.
    --cri-socket=: Path to the CRI socket to connect. If empty kubeadm will try to auto-detect this value; use this option only if you have more than one CRI installed or if you have non-standard CRI socket.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm reset` command is a utility used for managing a Kubernetes cluster with Kubeadm. When running with the `phase cleanup-node`, it will remove all data related to a specific node from the Kubernetes control plane. This includes deleting the node''s Kubernetes configuration and certificate authorities, effectively disabling the node from the cluster. However, this command doesn''t affect the actual node machine itself, meaning its OS, applications or user data remain unaffected. It is typically used to remove a node from the cluster and prepare it for joining back later with new configurations.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: '[AI] `kubeadm reset` is a command-line tool used to initialize and manage a Kubernetes cluster using Kubeadm, an open-source project for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters. The `phase cleanup-node` argument passed to the `reset` command is used to remove all data related to a specific node from the Kubernetes control plane. This includes deleting certificates, client configuration data, and removing the node from the cluster''s Etcd database. The `--cert-dir` option specifies the directory containing the SSL certificates for the node. By default, Kubeadm generates these certificates during the node joining process and stores them in this directory. Removing the certificates with `cleanup-node` ensures that they cannot be used to rejoin the node to the cluster without generating new ones.'

            [AI] `kubeadm reset` is a command-line tool for initializing and managing Kubernetes clusters using Kubeadm, an open-source project to deploy and manage a Kubernetes cluster. The specific command you provided, `kubeadm reset phase cleanup-node --cri-socket <socket>`, triggers the "cleanup-node" phase during the reset process.

            This phase is responsible for removing a node from the existing cluster and releasing all resources associated with it. Additionally, it sets up a new CRI (Container Runtime Interface) socket at the specified location `<socket>` for the node to use when rejoining the cluster as a worker node.

            After running this command, the node is no longer part of the cluster and must be manually rejoined using other kubeadm commands or by manually updating its configuration files if you plan to continue using it in your cluster.
