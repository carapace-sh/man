documentation:
    command: '[AI] `npm team add` is a command used in npm (Node Package Manager) to register a new NPM team or organization for collaborative publishing and management of packages under one account. When you run `npm team add <team-name>`, it adds the specified team as a member of your npm registry account, allowing you to publish packages on behalf of that team. This command typically requires authentication using an npm login. Once added, team members can use `npm publish --access=team` when publishing packages, ensuring they''re associated with the team in the npm registry.'
