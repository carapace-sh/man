A trace observer is a component that ingests traces from various sources and sends them to New Relic for further analysis. By deleting an observer, you remove its ability to collect and forward traces to New Relic. This command can be run in the CLI interface of New Relic Edge.'

        id: '[AI] The command `newrelic edge trace-observer delete --id` is used in New Relic''s Edge product to delete a specific trace observer with the given ID from the Edge service. This deletion results in the removal of data associated with that observer, such as collected traces and metrics. It is important to ensure that only unnecessary or unwanted observers are deleted to prevent unintended data loss.'
