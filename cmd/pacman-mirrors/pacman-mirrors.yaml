        quiet: '[AI] `pacman-mirrors --quiet` is a command used with Pacman, a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. This command is used to set or query the current mirrors used by Pacman, but in quiet mode (--quiet), it will only print out the mirror URLs without any additional output or messages. Essentially, it''s used to view or modify the mirror configuration silently.'
        re-branch: '[AI] The `pacman-mirrors --re-branch` command is a utility in Arch Linux''s Pacman package manager. It reconfigures the mirrorlist file, which determines the Pakages'' sources, by updating the branches of the mirror servers to the latest available. This ensures that users get the fastest and most up-to-date mirrors for their software downloads.'
        set-branch: |-
            [AI] The `pacman-mirrors --set-branch` command is a utility used in Arch Linux to configure Pacman package manager's mirror list. It specifically sets the branch of each mirror to the one that best fits the user's location and network conditions, improving the speed and reliability of package downloads.

            When you run `pacman-mirrors --set-branch`, it fetches a list of available mirrors from the Arch Linux servers, analyzes the latency to each mirror, and sets the branch (either 'slow' or 'fast') for each based on this analysis. The idea is that slower connections should be assigned to slower branches to avoid slowing down other users on faster connections by hogging bandwidth.

            Once executed, your Pacman configuration will be updated with the new mirror list having the best branch settings for your network conditions.
        status: '[AI] `pacman-mirrors --status` is a command used in Arch Linux and its derivatives to display the current status of the Pacman package mirrorlist. It shows the priority and server address of each mirror, allowing users to easily check which mirror is being used for package downloads and if there''s a faster or closer alternative available.'
        timeout: '[AI] `pacman-mirrors --timeout` is a command in Arch Linux''s Pacman package manager used to configure mirrorlists, which are lists of Arch Linux mirrors from which Pacman will download packages. The `--timeout` option sets the time in seconds that Pacman waits for a response from each mirror before moving on to the next one. This can be useful when connecting to slow or unreliable mirrors, as it allows Pacman to spend more time trying to connect to a faster mirror before giving up and moving on to the next one.'
        url: '[AI] The `pacman-mirrors --url` command is used to display or set the URLs of the Pacman mirrors in Arch Linux or other Arch-based distributions. Pacman is a package manager for Arch and its derivatives, responsible for installing and updating software packages. Mirrors are remote servers that store the package repositories, allowing users to download packages faster and more reliably from a location closer to them. The `--url` option allows you to set or print the URLs of these mirrors, ensuring your system gets updated from the fastest and most reliable sources.'
        version: '[AI] `pacman-mirrors --version` is a command used with Pacman, a popular package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. This command is used to display the version information of the pacman-mirrors package. Pacman-mirrors is a helper tool that allows users to configure their Pacman mirrors, which are servers where Pacman downloads packages from. By checking the version, users can ensure they have the latest version of this utility and can plan for potential upgrades or troubleshooting if needed.'
