documentation:
    command: '[AI] `brew test` is a Homebrew command used to run tests for installed packages. It automatically detects and runs tests defined in the package repositories, helping to ensure that installed software functions correctly and identifies any potential issues.'
    flag:
        HEAD: '[AI] `brew test --HEAD` is a command used in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. This specific command runs tests on the latest commit or branch (referred to as `--HEAD`) of the Homebrew repository before installing or upgrading any packages. The purpose of this command is to ensure that the software being installed is functioning properly and does not contain any known issues. It checks for potential build errors, dependencies, and other tests defined in the Homebrew formulae to maintain the stability and reliability of the system.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew test --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs automated tests on Homebrew''s installed packages to ensure their correctness and functionality. The `--debug` flag enables more detailed output during the testing process, allowing users to diagnose potential issues.'
        force: '[AI] `brew test --force` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `test` subcommand runs automated tests on Homebrew''s installed packages. The `--force` option tells Homebrew to run these tests even if they previously passed or if there are dependency conflicts. This can help catch potential issues and ensure the correctness of installed software.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `brew test --help` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command displays help information about the `brew test` sub-command.

            `brew test` is designed to automate testing of Homebrew formulae, ensuring their correctness and compatibility before they are installed or updated via Homebrew. Running `brew test --help` provides details on how to use this command, such as available options, examples of its usage, and a brief description of what it does.
        keep-tmp: |-
            [AI] The `brew test --keep-tmp` command is used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to run tests on installed packages while keeping the temporary files generated during the testing process.

            By default, Homebrew cleans up temporary files after running tests. However, the `--keep-tmp` flag prevents this behavior and keeps the temporary files around for further inspection or debugging purposes.

            The command `brew test` itself runs automated tests on all installed packages to ensure their functionality and compatibility with each other. Running `brew test --keep-tmp` will perform the same tests but retain any generated temporary files for additional analysis if needed.
        quiet: '[AI] `brew test --quiet` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--quiet` option makes the output of the command run silently, meaning it will not print any progress messages or success/failure notifications to the terminal. The main purpose of this command is to automatically run tests on all installed Homebrew packages in the background. This can help identify and resolve potential issues with software installations.'
        retry: '[AI] `brew test --retry` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs automated tests on outdated or problematic Homebrew installations. When an installation fails initial tests, `--retry` option is used to attempt running the tests again. The goal is to identify and resolve any issues with packages, ensuring their correct functionality within the system.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew test --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs automated tests on installed Homebrew packages to ensure their correct functionality. The `--verbose` flag increases the output level of the command, providing more detailed information about the tests being run and their results.'
