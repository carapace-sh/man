        [AI] The `kubeadm init` command is used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster with a single-node or multi-node setup. The `phase` term is not directly related to this command as it is typically used to describe the different stages of the initialization process.

        When you run `kubeadm init`, it performs several tasks:

        1. It installs Kubernetes components, such as kubelet, kubeadm, and kubectl on the node.
        2. It sets up the Kubernetes control plane components, including etcd, kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler.
        3. It configures kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl on the node to connect to the cluster.
        4. It initializes the container runtime (usually Docker) for running containers in the cluster.
        5. Finally, it prints out the join command for adding worker nodes to the cluster.

        So, if you're asking about a specific phase of the `kubeadm init` process, you might be referring to one of these individual tasks. But without more context, it's not possible to provide a precise answer.
