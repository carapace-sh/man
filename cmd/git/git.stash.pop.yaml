documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git stash pop` is a Git command used to apply the latest stashed changes from your Git stashing area onto the current branch. It not only applies the changes but also removes the stashed changes from the stack. If there are multiple stashes, using `pop` will apply the most recent one by default. If the stash cannot be applied cleanly, `git stash apply` should be used instead and manually resolve any conflicts.'
    flag:
        index: '[AI] `git stash pop --index` is a Git command used to apply the latest stashed changes from your stashing area (stash) onto the current index and working directory. It''s similar to using `git stash apply`, but with an additional flag `--index` that also updates the index files to match the changes in the stash. In other words, it brings back both the changes in the staging area and the working directory at once, making it convenient when you want to get back to the state of your last stash while keeping track of the changes you''ve staged.'
        quiet: '[AI] `git stash pop --quiet` is a Git command used to apply the latest stashed changes from your Git stashing area (stash) to the current branch, discarding the stash afterwards. The `--quiet` option suppresses informational messages that would normally be displayed during the operation. This command can be useful when you want to quickly and quietly bring back your stashed changes without interruptions or leaving a record of the applied stash in the Git history.'
