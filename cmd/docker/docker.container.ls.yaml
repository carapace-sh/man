documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker container ls` command is used to list all the running and stopped containers in a Docker environment. It displays various details about each container such as its name, image, status (running or stopped), creation time, and network settings. By default, it shows the containers in alphabetical order. If you specify an optional filter argument, it can be used to display containers based on specific criteria like their names, images, or states.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] The `docker container ls --all` command is used to list all containers running in a Docker environment, regardless of their status (i.e., including those that have exited or been removed). This command displays detailed information about each container such as its ID, image, creation date, status, and ports being used. It''s useful when you need an overview of all existing containers, whether they are currently active or not.'
        filter: '[AI] `docker container ls --filter` is a command used in Docker to list running containers with specific filters applied. The `--filter` option allows you to apply different filters to the output, such as filtering by name, state, or labels. For instance, `docker container ls --filter "name=mycontainer"` lists only the container named "mycontainer", and `docker container ls --filter "status=running"` lists only the running containers.'
        format: '[AI] `docker container ls --format` is a command used in Docker to list all running and stopped containers. The `--format` option allows customizing the output format of this command by specifying a Go template string. This can be useful for extracting specific information from the container list, such as just the container ID or name, or displaying additional metadata like the created time or image used. By default, without `--format`, Docker will display a standard table view of container information.'
        last: '[AI] The `docker container ls --filter="status=running" --sort="created_at"` command lists all running Docker containers in a system, sorted by their creation time in descending order. The `--filter` option is used to filter the output to only show containers with a status of "running". This can be shortened to `docker container ls --last` as an alias for this specific command.'
        latest: '[AI] `docker container ls --latest` is a command used in Docker to list all containers, but only showing the one with the most recent creation time. This means it will display the container that was started or created most recently among all existing containers in your Docker environment.'
        no-trunc: '[AI] The `docker container ls --no-trunc` command is used to list all running and stopped containers in a Docker environment. The `--no-trunic` option suppresses the truncation of container names in output, meaning you will see the full length of each container name. By default, if a container name exceeds the width of your terminal, it gets truncated, but with this flag, that doesn''t happen.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `docker container ls --quiet` command is used to list all running Docker containers in a minimal format with each line containing the container ID followed by its name separated by a single space character. This format is referred to as "quiet" or "plain text output", which means that no additional information such as status, image name, or created date is displayed. The command is useful when processing Docker containers programmatically and doesn''t need the extra details.'
        size: '[AI] `docker container ls --size` is a command used in Docker to list all running and stopped containers along with their size information. The `--size` option displays the total file size of each container, including the size of its associated image, as well as the size of the container''s filesystem. This can be helpful for managing container resources and identifying any large or resource-intensive containers.'
