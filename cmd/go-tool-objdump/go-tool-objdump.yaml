name: go-tool-objdump
description: Objdump disassembles executable files
flags:
    -S: print Go code alongside assembly
    -gnu: print GNU assembly next to Go assembly
    -s=: only dump symbols matching this regexp
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `go-tool-objdump` is a command-line tool that is part of the Go programming language''s standard library. It provides an interface similar to the Unix `objdump` utility, allowing users to inspect, disassemble, and dump various sections from Go compiled binary files. Users can extract information such as symbols, relocations, and assembly code to gain insight into the binary''s internal workings. The tool is invoked using the go command followed by ''tool'', ''objdump''. For example: `go tool objdump <filename>`.'
    flag:
        S: '[AI] `go-tool-objdump` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library. The `-S` (or `--disassemble`) flag instructs it to output the assembly code corresponding to the specified object file or section. This can be useful for understanding low-level machine code generated by the Go compiler.'
        gnu: '[AI] `go-tool-objdump` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library. The `-gnu` flag is an option that influences the output format of the tool, specifically it makes the output conform to the GNU `readelf` format. This means the tool generates detailed information about the sections, symbols, and other data in compiled Go binary files, which can be useful for debugging and reverse engineering purposes.'
        s: '[AI] `go-tool-objdump` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library for examining and manipulating object files. The `-s` (or --sections) flag instructs it to display detailed information about one or more sections of an object file, including their virtual addresses, sizes, and contents. It can be used for debugging or reverse engineering purposes, providing insight into the layout and composition of the object file''s memory image.'
