documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm cache add` command is used to add or reinstall a specific package and its dependencies from the npm cache into the local project''s node\_modules folder. This can be useful when you want to restore a previous version of a package that you had installed but was subsequently updated, or if you suspect that there might be corrupted files in your current node\_modules directory. The command takes the package name as an argument: `npm cache add <package-name>`.'
