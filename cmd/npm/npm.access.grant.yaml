        [AI] The `npm access grant` command is used to grant or manage permissions for publishing packages on the npm (Node Package Manager) registry. It requires npm authentication to be set up and the use of an NPM token. This command is typically used by organizations that want to control which members can publish packages under their organization's scope. To grant access, you would provide the username or email address of the person being granted permissions, along with the type of access (e.g., publish, publish-and-proxy, or read) in the command line. For example:

        `npm access grant <username_or_email> publish`

        This command grants the specified user the ability to publish packages under your organization's scope on the npm registry.
