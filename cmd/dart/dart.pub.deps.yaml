    command: '[AI] `dart pub deps` is a command used in Dart programming language for managing dependencies declared in a `pubspec.yaml` file. When run in the terminal or command prompt, it retrieves the latest versions of specified dependencies and their transitive dependencies, saving them in the `pubcache` folder for later use. This helps keep your project up-to-date with the latest libraries and saves time on downloading and compiling them during build.'
    flag:
        dev: '[AI] `dart pub deps --dev` is a command used in Dart programming language for managing dependencies. It interacts with the `pubspec.yaml` file in your project to add, update, or remove development (--dev) dependencies. Development dependencies are packages that aren''t required for building or running your application but are useful during development, like test frameworks or editor extensions. Running this command will modify the `pubspec.lock` file and update the `package_config.json` file accordingly. It does not install or download new dependencies, only updates the configuration files to prepare for a `pub get` command to fetch the packages.'
        directory: |-
            [AI] The `dart pub deps --directory` command is used in Dart programming to manage dependencies declared in a `pubspec.yaml` file, which defines the metadata and dependencies for a Dart project.

            When run with the `--directory` option, `dart pub deps` generates lock files and downloads the necessary dependency packages into the specified local directory (the current directory by default), rather than adding them as sub-directories within the project. This approach allows for easier management of project dependencies at the file system level and can be useful when working on large projects or deploying to production environments.
        executables: '[AI] The `dart pub global activate --executables` command is used in Dart programming language to manage and install Dart executable packages globally, which can be run from the command line directly without needing a Dart project setup. These executable packages often provide useful utilities or tools for developers, such as Flutter CLI for mobile app development. When executed, it activates (installs) the specified executable package globally in your Dart installation, making it available to use across projects.'
        help: '[AI] `dart pub deps --help` is a command used in Dart programming language to display help information about the `pub dep` sub-command of the Dart Pub package manager. This command shows the available options and their usage for managing dependencies declared in a `pubspec.yaml` file, including installing, updating, or removing dependencies. It assists users in using this tool effectively to manage their project''s dependencies.'
        json: '[AI] `dart pub depsex --json` is a command used in Dart programming language to generate a json file listing the direct dependencies of a Dart project, as managed by the `pub.dev` package registry. The output file can be useful for versioning and managing dependencies in automated build processes.'
        no-dev: '[AI] The `dart pub deps --no-dev` command is used in Dart programming language for managing dependencies within a project using the `pub.dev` repository. This specific command retrieves and saves only the production (non-development) dependencies listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file, excluding any development or test dependencies. The result is a `pubspec.lock` file that locks down the exact versions of those dependencies, ready for building and deploying an application.'
        style: |-
            [AI] The `dart pub deps --style` command is used in Dart programming language to generate a `pubspec.yaml` file with dependency declarations following a specific style. It's part of the `pub` package manager for Dart and is invoked from the terminal or command prompt.

            The available styles are: `dart`, `dev`, and `fixed`. Each style specifies how dependencies should be declared in the `pubspec.yaml` file. The default style is `dart`, but other styles can be used to conform to different project requirements or preferences.
