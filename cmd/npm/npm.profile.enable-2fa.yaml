description: enable two-factor authorization
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm` command `profile enable-2fa` is used to enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on an npm account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a time-based one-time password or authentication code in addition to the regular username and password during login. To use it, first make sure you have installed the `otplib` package with `npm install -g otplib`. Then run `npm login --2fa` to begin the 2FA setup process by entering your npm credentials and following the on-screen instructions to receive a verification code via email or an authenticator app. Finally, enable 2FA for your account by running `npm profile enable-2fa`. Once enabled, you will be required to enter the one-time verification codes during future logins.'
