    command: '[AI] The `flutter pub global run` command is used to execute a global Flutter package as if it were a binary. It retrieves and runs the specified global package from the Flutter registry, bypassing the need for manually installing or managing dependencies locally. This command can be particularly useful when dealing with development tools or utilities that are distributed as Flutter packages.'
    flag:
        enable-asserts: '[AI] `flutter pub global run --enable-asserts` is a command used in Flutter development to run a package globally with assertions enabled. When you execute this command, it fetches the specified package from the Flutter packages registry and runs it as a separate application. The `--enable-asserts` flag enables assertions during the execution of the package, which can help in catching potential bugs and issues by checking for expected conditions at runtime. This is particularly useful when developing or testing your Flutter applications.'
        enable-experiment: '[AI] The `flutter pub global run --enable-experiment` command is used in Flutter development to enable experimental features that are not enabled by default in the Dart language or Flutter framework. These experiments can provide new capabilities or improvements, but they may also introduce bugs or instability. By using this command with the `pub global run` tool, you can globally enable these experiments for your project and its dependencies. This allows you to test and experiment with new features while developing your application.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `flutter pub global run --help` is a command used in Flutter development. The `global` keyword indicates that this is a command from the Flutter tools, specifically `pub`, which is the package manager for Dart and Flutter projects.

            The `run` subcommand executes a script (usually located in a `pubspec.yaml` file) defined under the `flutter:` key in the project's root `pubspec.yaml`. This script, often called a "global script," can perform various tasks like running tests, building the app for deployment, or serving a web app.

            The `--help` option requests that the command displays its help text. This will provide information about how to use this command and what options are available. It's helpful when you want to learn more about what a particular command does or when you need to check the syntax of using it with different arguments.
        no-enable-asserts: '[AI] The command `flutter pub global run --no-enable-asserts` is used to run a Flutter application or package globally from the terminal, without enabling assertions. Assertions are checks built into the code that ensure the program is running correctly and consistently. However, they can add runtime overhead and may provide unnecessary information during production use. The `--no-enable-asserts` option disables assertions to improve performance and minimize output for a more streamlined build process.'
        no-sound-null-safety: '[AI] `flutter pub global run` is a command used in Flutter development to execute a global package published on `pub.dev`. The `--no-sound-null-safety` flag is an option that disables null safety analysis during the execution of the command. This means that the Dart compiler will not enforce null safety rules when running the global package, potentially allowing for null errors to occur. It''s important to note that using this flag goes against the recommended use of null safety in Flutter projects and may result in runtime errors if not used carefully.'
        sound-null-safety: '[AI] The command `flutter pub global run --no-sound-null-safe` is used in Flutter development to install and run a global package without enabling null safety. When running this command, Flutter''s `pub` tool installs the specified global package and then runs it directly, bypassing the null safety checks. This can be useful when testing or debugging packages that may not yet support null safety or when working with older packages that don''t have null safety enabled. However, disabling null safety checks means that your project may contain null references, which could lead to runtime errors if not handled properly.'
