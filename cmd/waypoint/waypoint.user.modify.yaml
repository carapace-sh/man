documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint user modify` command is used in Docker''s Compose file to update the configuration of an existing user-defined service in a Compose file. This command takes new key-value pair arguments that modify or override the existing configuration properties for the specified service under the `users` section. When run, it rewrites the Compose file with the updated user configuration before starting or rebuilding the services.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `waypoint user modify --app` command in Docker is used to update the access and permission settings for a specific user or group within a Docker application. It modifies the user and group configurations defined in the `app.toml` file for a Waypoint-managed application. The changes can include adding, removing, or updating users and groups, as well as adjusting their permissions. This command allows fine-grained control over who has access to the application''s containers and the associated Docker resources.'
        display-name: '[AI] The `waypoint` command is a tool for managing complex applications and infrastructure deployments using Hashicorp''s Nomad or Consul. The `user modify` subcommand is used to update specific details of registered users, while the `--display-name` flag sets a new name that will be displayed when interacting with the Nomad or Consul UI. For example: `waypoint user modify <username> --display-name <new_name>`. This command changes the display name associated with the given username in the system.'
        new-username: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint` command is a tool for managing and updating infrastructure as code, particularly with HashiCorp's Nomad and Consul. The given flag, `--new-username`, is part of the `user modify` subcommand.

            This flag is used to update the username associated with an existing user in the `waypoint` configuration file (`.waypointrc`). By passing this flag along with the `--new-username` argument, you can change the current username to a new one. The modification will be saved in the configuration file and will take effect in subsequent `waypoint` operations.
        plain: '[AI] The command `waypoint user modify --plain` is used in Waypoint, a Hashicorp tool for managing multi-container applications. This command modifies the definition of an existing user in Waypoint''s configuration files directly, without using YAML syntax or other abstractions. The `--plain` flag specifies that the output should be in plain text format, making it easier to edit the file manually.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint user modify --project` command is used with Waypoint, an open-source tool for managing application configurations and secrets in a DevOps pipeline. This specific command modifies the access permissions of a user within a given project. By providing the appropriate flags and arguments, such as the user name, new role or access level, and the project name, this command enables you to manage user access levels in Waypoint projects.'
        username: '[AI] The `waypoint` command with the `user modify --username` option is used to update the username associated with a Waypoint (a Docker host managed by Tanzu Kubernetes Grid) in Tanzu Kubernetes Grid. This flag modifies the identity and access management (IAM) configuration of the specified Waypoint, allowing you to change the associated username for authentication purposes.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint user modify --workspace` command in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool is used to update the credentials or access keys associated with a specific workspace for a given user. This command modifies the existing user record and does not create a new one, making it useful when the user''s access keys need to be updated. By specifying the desired workspace name and the user details (usually in the form of a YAML file), Waypoint will update the credentials for that user within the specified workspace.'
