        [AI] The `deno help` command is a utility provided by Deno, a modern JavaScript runtime. It is used to display various forms of help information about Deno and its components, such as commands, flags, and usage examples.

        When you run `deno help` without any arguments, it will show an overview of Deno's main features and capabilities. However, if you provide a specific command or topic as an argument (e.g., `deno help install` or `deno help test`), the output will focus on that particular topic. This command can be particularly useful when you're starting with Deno and want to learn more about its functions quickly.
