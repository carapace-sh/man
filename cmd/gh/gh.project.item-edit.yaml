documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh project item-edit` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to edit an existing project item, such as a card, issue, or pull request, in a GitHub Project. You need to specify the project ID and the item ID along with the new details you wish to set. The basic syntax is `gh project item-edit PROJECT_ID ITEM_ID --title "NEW_TITLE" [--body "NEW_BODY"] [--label "LABEL_NAME"]`, where `PROJECT_ID` and `ITEM_ID` are placeholders for your specific project and item identifiers, and the square brackets indicate optional arguments. This command allows you to easily update project items directly from the terminal.'
    flag:
        body: '[AI] The `gh project item-edit` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to edit an item in a GitHub Project. The `--body` option is used to specify the new content or message to be set for the item being edited. This could be a new title, description, or any other text-based data associated with the project item. This command updates the project item locally and then pushes the changes to the remote repository upon confirmation.'
        clear: '[AI] The `gh project item-edit --clear` command is used with GitHub''s `gh` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool to clear custom fields of a specific project item in a GitHub Project. This command does not make any changes to the title, description, or labels of the item but removes all existing key-value pairs in its custom fields.'
        date: '[AI] The `gh project item-edit` command is used in GitHub''s `git-hub` CLI tool to edit an existing project item, such as a label or a milestone. The `--date` option sets a new due date for the project item. For example, `gh project item-edit <ID> --date="2023-03-15"` sets the new due date for the project item with ID to March 15, 2023.'
        field-id: '[AI] The `gh project item-edit` is a command used in GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, called `git hub`, for managing GitHub projects. This specific command is for editing an existing project item, such as an issue or pull request. The `--field-id` flag is an optional argument provided with this command to specify the ID of a particular field within the project item that you wish to edit. It helps to update a specific value in a particular field without having to modify the entire item.'
        format: |-
            [AI] `gh project item-edit` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to edit an existing project item, such as an issue or pull request. The `--format` option specifies the output format for the command's result. This can include various placeholders and customizations, allowing users to tailor the output to their needs. For example:

            ```bash
            gh project item-edit 123 --title "New Title" --body "Updated body text" --label label --format={"id":0,"number":1,"title":"{title}","html_url":"{html_url}","labels":[{label}]}
            ```

            This command would edit the project item with ID 123, updating its title and body, adding a label, and using the provided format to customize the output.
        id: |-
            [AI] The command `gh project item-edit --id` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command for managing projects using the GitHub desktop application in a terminal or command prompt.

            This specific command is used to edit an existing project item with a given ID. Here's a brief explanation of its components:

            * `gh`: The `gh` prefix refers to the GitHub CLI, which is a set of commands for managing GitHub resources from a terminal or command prompt.
            * `project`: This specifies that the following command will be related to managing projects within GitHub.
            * `item-edit`: This part indicates that the command's function is to edit an existing project item.
            * `--id`: The `--id` flag is used to specify the unique identifier of the project item you want to edit. It's a required argument, and it should be followed by the actual ID value.

            In summary, the command `gh project item-edit --id <ID>` allows users to edit an existing project item with the given ID using the GitHub CLI.
        iteration-id: '[AI] The `gh project item-edit` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to edit an existing project item, such as an issue or pull request, in a GitHub project. The `--iteration-id` flag is an optional argument that specifies the iteration identifier associated with the Agile workflow of the project. When this flag is included, it allows users to link the edited project item to a specific iteration. This helps in tracking progress and managing the development cycle within the GitHub project.'
        jq: |-
            [AI] `gh` is a command-line tool for GitHub interactions. The given command is using the `gh project` sub-command with the `item-edit` action, followed by the `--jq` flag.

            The `item-edit` action allows editing project card details such as title, description, and labels. `--jq` flag is used to pass a JQ filter query for manipulating JSON data. Together, this command is intended to edit specific fields of a GitHub Project's item using JSON filtering with the JQ tool.
        number: '[AI] The `gh project item-edit` is a command used in GitHub''s Git CLI (github-cli) to edit an existing project item, such as an issue or pull request. The `--number` flag specifies the unique identifier number of the specific item to be edited. Together, this command allows you to modify the content of an existing project item directly from the command line interface.'
        project-id: '[AI] The `gh project item-edit` is a command used in GitHub''s `git-hub` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. This command is used to edit an item in a specific GitHub Project. The `--project-id` flag represents the unique identifier of the GitHub Project that you want to modify an item within. It allows users to update details such as title, description, or assignees for issues and pull requests, without opening the web interface.'
        single-select-option-id: '[AI] The `gh project item-edit` is a command used in GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, called `git hub`, to edit an existing project item. The specific form of this command with the flag `--single-select-option-id` instructs it to only allow editing one option at a time among multiple options associated with the project item. This flag helps maintain the consistency and accuracy of the changes made to the project item''s options, reducing the risk of unintended consequences from editing multiple options simultaneously.'
        template: '[AI] `gh project item-edit` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to edit an existing project item, such as a card, issue, or pull request. The `--template` option specifies the use of a custom template file for creating a new issue or pull request. This can be useful when you want to ensure consistency in your issue or pull request descriptions, or when you frequently create similar items and want to save time by using a predefined format. The command takes various arguments, including the project name, item number, and the path to the template file. For example: `gh project add myproject label "bug" --template my-template.md`.'
        text: '[AI] The command `gh project item-edit --text` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to edit an item''s text description in a GitHub Project. The `item-edit` subcommand modifies a specific project item, and the `--text` option sets or updates the text description associated with that item.'
        title: '[AI] `gh project item-edit` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to edit an existing item in a GitHub Project. The `--title` option sets the new title for the item being edited. Together, these arguments instruct the GitHub CLI tool to open the interface for editing the title of a specific project item.'
