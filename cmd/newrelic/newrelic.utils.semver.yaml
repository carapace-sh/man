        [AI] `newrelic utils semver` is a command-line utility provided by New Relic for handling Semantic Versioning (SemVer) related tasks. It's part of the New Relic Toolkit, which can be installed with Node.js packages like `newrelic-cli` or `@newrelic/utils`.

        The command itself helps to analyze, parse and validate SemVer strings. Specific use cases include checking if a given version is valid, comparing versions, resolving the next major/minor/patch increment based on change types (breaking, feature, or bug fix), or even generating a new SemVer string based on provided information.

        In summary, `newrelic utils semver` simplifies SemVer handling in development, deployment, and release processes.
