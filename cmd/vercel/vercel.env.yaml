        [AI] `vercel env` is a command used in Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, to manage environment variables. It allows you to set, update, or delete environment variables associated with your project or application.

        Here are some common uses of the `vercel env` command:

        1. Setting new environment variables: `vercel env MY_VAR=value --prod (for production environments)` or `vercel env MY_VAR=value` (for development environments)
        2. Updating existing environment variables: `vercel env MY_VAR=new_value --prod` or `vercel env MY_VAR=new_value`
        3. Deleting environment variables: `vercel env delete MY_VAR --prod` or `vercel env delete MY_VAR`

        Note that changes made with the `env` command will take effect after the next deployment, and you may need to have the necessary permissions in your Vercel organization to use it.
