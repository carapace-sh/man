    command: '[AI] `ng deploy` is a command used in Angular projects built with the Angular CLI. It builds the project for production, including compiling TypeScript code, optimizing assets, and minifying files. Then it packages the output and deploys it to a target server or hosting platform using configured deployment methods such as GitHub Pages or Netlify. The result is a live, production-ready version of your Angular application accessible via a URL.'

            [AI] `ng deploy --configuration` is a command used in Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. This command is part of Angular CLI (Command Line Interface), and it is responsible for building and deploying an Angular application for production use.

            The `--configuration` option specifies the name of a deployment configuration file located in the `angular.json` project file under the `deploy.configs` key. This file provides custom configurations that can be used to optimize builds for different environments or deployment targets, such as setting environment variables or enabling source maps. By providing a specific configuration name with `--configuration`, the command will use the corresponding settings when building and deploying the application.
