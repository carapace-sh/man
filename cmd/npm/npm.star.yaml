flags:
    --unicode: use unicode in output
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm star` command is used in Node.js projects to rate a specific package by increasing its rating score on npm registry. It takes the name of the desired package as an argument and looks up its npm package JSON file to locate the author email address. Then, it opens your default email client with a pre-filled message containing the "star" request and the author''s email address. Once you send the message, npm registers your vote by incrementing the package''s star count on the npm registry.'
    flag:
        unicode: '[AI] `npm star --unicode` is a command used in npm (Node Package Manager) to give stars as ratings for packages in Unicode format, instead of traditional dots or numbers. It''s a way to express enthusiasm for a package using emoticons or other graphical representations within the command line interface. This can make the output of `npm ls --long` and similar commands more visually appealing, but it doesn''t affect the actual functionality or ranking of packages in npm registries.'
