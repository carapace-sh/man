documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tofu fmt` is a command used in Tofu, a modern dependency manager for Rust. This command is responsible for formatting the Rust codebase based on the configured style guide, typically enforcing a consistent coding style across the project.'
    flag:
        check: '[AI] `tofu fmt -check` is a command used in the Tofu file format library for checking the syntax and validity of TOML (Tom''s Obvious, Minimal Language) configuration files. The TOML format is popular for its simplicity and human-readability. The `fmt` tool from the Tofu library is used to format and lint TOML files, while the `-check` flag is used specifically to run checks without actually writing any output or formatting the file. This command can help ensure that a TOML configuration file adheres to the specified format before using it in other applications.'
        diff: '[AI] `tofu fmt --diff` is a command used with the Tofu data serialization library in Rust programming language. This command generates a diff (difference) output between two versions of serialized data. The diff output can then be applied with `tofu apply` to update data, allowing for easy and efficient data versioning and management.'
        list: '[AI] `tofu fmt -list` is a command used in Tofu, a configuration management tool for Kubernetes. This command lists all available formats that Tofu supports for managing and storing configuration data. These formats include YAML, JSON, HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language), and others, enabling users to choose the preferred format for their configuration files.'
        no-color: '[AI] `tofu fmt -no-color` is a command used in Tofu, a text diff and patch tool. The option `-no-color` instructs Tofu to output patches without using color coding. This means that the differences between files will be displayed using plain text instead of colored syntax highlighting.'
        recursive: '[AI] `tofu fmt` is a tool from the Tofu data format transformation and serialization library. The `-recursive` flag indicates that the formatting operation should be applied recursively to nested data structures within files. When used with `tofu fmt`, this flag ensures that the formatting is consistent across all levels of nesting, making the output easier to read and maintain.'
        write: '[AI] `tofu fmt -write` is a command used in Tofu, a secret manager tool for encrypted data storage and sharing in Kubernetes. The `fmt` subcommand here is responsible for formatting Kubernetes YAML files, while `-write` flag writes or saves the output to files instead of just displaying it on the terminal. This combination allows users to update their Kubernetes configuration files with correctly formatted data stored in Tofu.'
