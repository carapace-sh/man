    command: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule delete` command is used to remove a binding rule from Consul''s Access Control List (ACL). Binding rules define which principals (entities with access) can perform specific actions on resources in Consul. By executing this command, you''re instructing the Consul ACL engine to delete the specified binding rule, thereby revoking its associated access permissions.'
    flag:
        ca-file: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule delete --ca-file` command is used to delete ACL (Access Control List) binding rules in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration.

            The `--ca-file` option specifies the path to a file containing the PEM-encoded Certificate Authority (CA) certificate or key, which is used to authenticate and encrypt communications between Consul and the client running the command. This is important for securing access to the Consul API and ensuring data integrity during the deletion of binding rules.

            In summary, this command is used to delete ACL binding rules in Consul with added security provided by using a CA file for secure communication.
        ca-path: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule delete --ca-path` command is used to delete a specific Access Control List (ACL) binding rule in Hashicorp Consul. Here's a brief explanation of the flags:

            * `consul`: This is the name of the command-line interface tool for managing Consul.
            * `acl`: This flag indicates that we are working with Consul's Access Control List feature.
            * `binding-rule`: This flag specifies that we will be working with binding rules, which define the access control policies for services or keys in a Consul service registry or key/value store.
            * `delete`: This flag instructs Consul to delete an existing binding rule.
            * `--ca-path`: This flag is used to specify the path to a CA (Certificate Authority) file when working with TLS-secured Consul clusters. It's required if you are using client certificates for authentication when deleting a binding rule.
        client-cert: |-
            [AI] The command `consul acl binding-rule delete --client-cert` is used to delete a binding rule in Consul's Access Control List (ACL) using a client certificate for authentication.

            Consul ACL allows defining rules that control access to its REST API resources based on specific conditions. Binding rules define which clients or services can connect to which resources using their certificates or tokens.

            The `delete` action removes an existing binding rule from the Consul ACL. The `--client-cert` option specifies the client certificate file path used for authenticating the Consul client executing the command against the server. This ensures that only clients with valid certificates can modify the ACL configuration.
        client-key: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule delete --client-key` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command deletes an Access Control List (ACL) binding rule with the specified client key from Consul''s ACL policy. When you provide a client key as an argument, Consul locates and removes the corresponding binding rule, effectively modifying access control for resources within the system. This can be useful in managing and securing the communication between different services or applications within a Consul deployment.'
        datacenter: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule delete --datacenter` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command deletes ACL (Access Control List) binding rules under the specified datacenter in Consul's access control system.

            ACL binding rules define how ACL policies are applied to services, checks, and other resources within Consul. By using `--datacenter` option with this command, you can specify which datacenter to delete the binding rules from. Deleting these rules may affect the security configuration of your Consul setup. Proceed with caution.
        http-addr: '[AI] The command `consul acl binding-rule delete --http-addr` is used to delete a specific ACL (Access Control List) binding rule in the Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. The `--http-addr` argument specifies the Consul HTTP API address where this operation will be executed. The `binding-rule delete` action removes an existing binding rule, which defines permissions for accessing resources within a Consul data center. This command is used when you want to revoke access granted by a previously defined binding rule.'
        id: '[AI] The command `consul acl binding-rule delete --id <ID>` is used to delete a specific binding rule with the given ID in Consul''s Access Control List (ACL). Consul is a Connect and Service Mesh platform that can be used for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command is part of the Consul ACL subcommand, which manages access control policies. Deleting a binding rule removes the associated permissions for principals (roles or users) on specific resources in the Consul system.'
        namespace: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule delete --namespace` command is used to delete ACL (Access Control List) binding rules in the Consul service discovery and configuration management tool, specifically those binding rules that are scoped to a particular namespace. With this command, an administrator can remove access permissions or restrictions for resources within a designated namespace.'
        stale: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule delete --stale` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command deletes stale ACL (Access Control List) binding rules from the Consul server's access control list.

            Stale binding rules are those which refer to resources that no longer exist in the Consul tree, such as services or keys that have been deleted. By removing these stale rules, you ensure that your access control policies remain up-to-date and secure. The `--stale` flag tells Consul to delete only the binding rules that are no longer associated with any existing resources.
        tls-server-name: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule delete --tls-server-name` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) binding rule in Hashicorp Consul, which is a connectivity and configuration management tool. This specific command is used when working with TLS encrypted communications.

            The `--acl` flag indicates that the operation being performed is related to ACL rules. The `binding-rule delete` part of the command means that an existing binding rule will be deleted. Finally, the `--tls-server-name` flag specifies that this binding rule applies to TLS communications and that the server name of the secure connection will be involved in the deletion process.

            In essence, this command is used to remove a TLS-specific ACL binding rule from Consul, allowing or denying access to services based on certain conditions.
        token: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule delete --token` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) binding rule in Hashicorp Consul, a service discovery and configuration management tool.

            The `acl` subcommand is for managing access control policies, while `binding-rule` refers to the specific rules that grant or deny permissions to different entities (keyspaces, services, etc.) within a Consul cluster. The `delete` action removes an existing binding rule, and the `--token` flag specifies the Consul agent token used for authentication when performing the operation.
        token-file: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule delete` command is used to remove a binding rule from Consul Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Hashicorp''s Consul service. This command requires an authentication token file, represented by the `--token-file` option, which grants sufficient permissions to modify ACL rules. Once executed with a valid token file, this command deletes the specified binding rule from the Consul ACL configuration.'
