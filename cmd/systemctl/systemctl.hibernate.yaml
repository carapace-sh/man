group: system
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `systemctl hibernate` command is used to initiate the system hibernation process in Linux systems that support it. Hibernation is a power management state where the operating system and all data currently in RAM are written to the hard drive, allowing the system to be powered off while preserving the current state of the system for quick resume upon powering back on. This can save energy and provide a faster boot time compared to a full shutdown and restart.'
