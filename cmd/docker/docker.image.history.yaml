description: Show the history of an image
flags:
    --format=: 'Format output using a custom template:'
    --no-trunc: Don't truncate output
    -H, --human: Print sizes and dates in human readable format
    -q, --quiet: Only show image IDs
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker image history` command is used to display the history of a Docker image, showing the different build stages and their corresponding SHA-1 hash codes. Each line in the output represents a specific step in the image''s build process, including the instruction used, the file(s) affected, and the time it was added to the image. This command is helpful for understanding the composition of an image and troubleshooting build issues.'
    flag:
        format: '[AI] `docker image history --format` is a command used to display the history of a Docker image, showing the different layers that make up the image and the size of each layer. The `--format` option allows customization of the output format using Go template syntax. This can be useful for automating or filtering the output based on specific criteria. Without `--format`, the default output will display a list of the parent images, their tags, and the size of each layer. With `--format`, you can specify how to print this information in a custom format, such as displaying only the image name and tag or showing the total size of an image and its ancestry.'
        human: '[AI] The `docker image history --human` command displays the history of a Docker image in human-readable format. It shows each step that was used to build the image, including the image name used at that step, the time it was created, and any messages associated with that step. By using the `--human` flag, the output is formatted in a way that''s easier for humans to read, making it simpler to understand the sequence of steps that went into creating the Docker image.'
        no-trunc: '[AI] The `docker image history --no-trunc` command displays the entire history of a Docker image, showing each individual layer and its corresponding SHA256 digest, message, and creation time. The `--no-trunc` option prevents the output from being truncated to just the last 10 layers by default. This allows for a more detailed examination of an image''s composition.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `docker image history --quito` command is used to display the history of a Docker image in a quiet or minimal format. This means that only the image ids and tags are printed, without any additional metadata such as creation time or author messages. This can be useful when automating tasks or scripts where only the image ids are required.'
