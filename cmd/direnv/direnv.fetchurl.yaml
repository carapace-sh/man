It''s designed to automatically fetch and apply new configuration files from remote repositories, based on the current working directory. This can be particularly useful when working with projects that have .env files stored in version control platforms like GitHub. By running `direnv fetchurl`, you ensure that your local environment variables are kept up-to-date with the latest versions in your repository.'
