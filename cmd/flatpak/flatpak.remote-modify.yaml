    command: |-
        [AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command used in the Flatpak packaging system to modify the configuration of remote repositories. It allows users or administrators to add, remove, or modify the flatpak remotes (repositories) in their system. The basic syntax is:

        ```bash
        flatpak remote-modify <remote_alias> [add|remove|modify] <remote_url> [--description <description>] [--gpg-keys <gpg_key_file>]
        ```

        Here, `<remote_alias>` is the name given to the remote repository, and `<remote_url>` is the URL of the repository. The command supports three actions:

        1. 'add': Add a new remote repository with the provided URL.
        2. 'remove': Remove an existing remote repository identified by its alias.
        3. 'modify': Update an existing remote repository's URL or metadata, such as its description and GPG keys.

        Additionally, you can specify optional parameters like --description for adding a description to the remote and --gpg-keys to add the GPG keys associated with the repository if it is signed.
    flag:
        authenticator-install: '[AI] The `flatpak remote-modify` command is used to modify settings of a Flatpak remote, which is a repository or distribution channel for Flatpak software packages. The specific option `--authenticator-install` instructs the command to install an authenticator for the given remote. Authenticators are trusted keys that allow Flatpak to verify the integrity and authenticity of packages downloaded from that remote. Installing an authenticator enables secure communication between your system and the remote repository, ensuring you obtain trusted software.'
        authenticator-name: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command-line utility used with the Flatpak application deployment system. The `--authenticator-name` option modifies the authenticator name of a remote repository. An authenticator is a trust mechanism that verifies and signs the software packages in the remote repository. By specifying a new authenticator name, you can change the name used to identify this specific remote in Flatpak. This can be useful if you want to differentiate between multiple trusted repositories with similar names or if you need to update the name of an existing remote for some reason.'
        authenticator-option: |-
            [AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command-line utility used in the Flatpak packaging system to modify remotely available repositories or remotes. The `--authenticator-option` is an option for this command. It allows specifying an authenticator option while adding, updating, or modifying a remote's authentication settings.

            In simpler terms, it enables you to define the specific authentication method (e.g., certificate or password) when interacting with a Flatpak repository. This can be useful if you need to connect to a custom or private repository that requires additional security checks.
        collection-id: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to modify configurations of remote repositories or collections. The `--collection-id` option is used with this command to specify the ID of the collection you want to modify. For instance, `flatpak remote-modify --collection-id=<ID> <operation>`, where `<operation>` can be an addition (`add`), removal (`remove`), or update (`update`) operation on a Flatpak remote or repository. This command allows you to modify the content of your Flatpak repositories in a fine-grained way, enabling efficient management and customization of software packages.'
        comment: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command-line utility used in the Flatpak application packaging system to modify settings of a remote repository. The `--comment` option allows you to change or add a comment associated with the given remote. For instance, `flatpak remote-modify --comment="My custom repo for latest apps"` can be used to update the description comment for a specific Flatpak remote.'
        default-branch: |-
            [AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command-line utility used with Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. The specific command `--default-branch` modifies the default branch of a Flatpak remote.

            When you add a new remote to your system using commands like `flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists`, it usually defaults to the 'master' or 'mainline' branch, which may not always be the most stable version for your system. You can change this default behavior by specifying a different branch name with `--default-branch`. For instance, `flatpak remote-modify --default-branch=stable myremote` will set the 'stable' branch as the default branch for the 'myremote' Flatpak repository. This way, when you install or update packages using the general command like `flatpak install myapp`, it will pull from the specified branch by default.
        description: '[AI] The `flatpak remote-modify` command is used to modify various properties of Flatpak remotes, which are repositories or distributions of applications packaged using the Flatpak platform. The `--description` option is used to update the description text associated with a specific remote. This could be useful if you manage multiple remote sources and need to keep track of their purpose or contents through clear and concise descriptions. By providing a new description as an argument, the command will update the remote''s metadata accordingly.'
        disable: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify --disable` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux desktops. This command is used to modify the enabled or disabled status of a specific remote, which is a collection of repositories that store Flatpak applications and their dependencies. By adding the `--disable` option, you are disabling the specified remote, meaning that it will no longer be used for installing or updating applications from it. This command can be useful if you want to temporarily stop using a particular remote, for example, if there are issues with the applications being served from that remote.'
        enable: '[AI] The `flatpak remote-modify --enable` command is used to enable or enable specific repositories in Flatpak, a software deployment system for Linux and other Unix systems. Flatpak uses remotes as repositories of applications and runtimes that can be installed on the system. This command allows you to modify the enabled state of a remote. By enabling a remote, you make it possible to install applications or runtimes from that repository on your system. The `--enable` flag enables the specified remote.'
        enumerate: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify --enumerate` is a command used with Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. This command lists all available Flatpak remotes, which are repositories of applications that can be installed using Flatpak. The option `--enumerate` returns the output in a format that can be easily processed by scripts or other automated tools, displaying details such as the remote''s name and URL for each listed remote.'
        filter: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command-line utility in Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. The `--filter` option is used to modify or filter specific aspects of a remote repository. When you run `flatpak remote-modify --filter <FILTER> <REMOTE>`, the `<FILTER>` argument specifies a JMESPath query string that defines which parts of the remote''s metadata you want to modify. For example, you can filter by the repository name or the application name, and then make changes such as enabling or disabling applications, updating their versions, etc. The result is an updated remote with the specified modifications.'
        follow-redirect: |-
            [AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command-line utility for Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. The specific option `--follow-redirect` is used when modifying a remote repository.

            When you run `flatpak update` or similar commands, Flatpak may download metadata from remote repositories over HTTPS. Sometimes, the server may redirect you to a different URL for the same repository. By default, Flatpak will not follow these redirections and instead report an error.

            The `--follow-redirect` option tells Flatpak to automatically follow any redirections it encounters when communicating with remote repositories during repository modification operations (e.g., adding or removing remotes). This is useful when the server's address changes, allowing you to keep your configuration up-to-date without having to manually modify it every time.
        gpg-import: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command-line utility used in the Flatpak package manager to modify configurations of remote repositories. The `--gpg-import` option is used to import GPG keys into a remote repository, allowing you to authenticate and trust the signed packages from that repository. By running `flatpak remote-modify --gpg-import <keyfile> <remote>`, you import the contents of the specified keyfile into the named remote repository for later use when installing or updating packages.'
        gpg-verify: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command-line tool used with the Flatpak software installation system for modifying repositories. The `--gpg-verify` option is used to enable or disable GPG signature verification for the remote repository being modified. When this option is set to true, Flatpak will only install packages from the specified remote if their GPG signatures are verified. This helps ensure the authenticity and integrity of the installed software packages.'

        homepage: '[AI] The `flatpak remote-modify` command is used to modify settings of Flatpak remotes, which are repositories or sources where you can install Flatpapk applications from. The specific option `--homepage <URL>` is used to change the homepage URL associated with a remote. This URL typically represents the location where you can find more information about the applications available in that remote and may be used by tools like software updaters or package managers to display relevant information.'
        icon: |-
            [AI] The `flatpak remote-modify` command is a utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. It allows you to modify various aspects of Flatpak remotes, which are collections of repositories that provide packages for installation.

            The specific subcommand you mentioned, `--icon`, is used to change the icon associated with a given remote. This can be useful if you want to easily identify a particular remote in the Flatpak GUI or in lists of remotes, such as when managing multiple remote repositories. To use it, simply call `flatpak remote-modify <remote> --icon <path-to-icon-file>`, where `<remote>` is the name or identifier of the remote you wish to modify and `<path-to-icon-file>` is the absolute path to the icon file you want to use.
        installation: '[AI] The `flatpak remote-modify` command is used to modify settings of Flatpak remotes, which are repositories where you can install Flatpapks applications. The specific command `--installation <remote> <option> [<value>]` modifies the installation behavior of a specified remote. For example, `--installation <remote> enable` enables automatic installation of new apps from that remote or `--installation <remote> disable` disables it. Other options include setting the priority level, checking for updates, and configuring auto-upgrades.'
        no-authenticator-install: |-
            [AI] The `flatpak remote-modify` command is a utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The specific option you mentioned, `--no-authenticator-install`, modifies how Flatpak interacts with remote repositories.

            Normally, when adding or updating remotes, Flatpak installs their authenticators (trusted keys) on the local system for secure communication. With `--no-authenticator-install` flag, you disable this behavior. This means that Flatpak will not ask for confirmation or installation of new remote authenticators during the operation.

            This option can be useful in specific situations, such as when working with untrusted repositories or if you prefer to manage your remote keys manually outside of Flatpak. However, it's important to remember that using untrusted sources may pose security risks and should only be done with caution.
        no-enumerate: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. The `--no-enumerate` option modifies the metadata of a remote repository without listing or downloading its packages first. In other words, it skips the enumeration step during the repository modification process, making the operation faster if you only intend to modify the repository metadata itself.'
        no-filter: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command used with Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The `--no-filter` option that follows this command is used to modify repository settings without applying any filters. In simpler terms, it modifies the remote repository configuration directly, without applying any additional filters or modifications.'
        no-follow-redirect: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment system for Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. The specific option `--no-follow-redirect` is used when modifying a remote repository''s configuration. With this option, the command does not follow any potential redirects specified in the given URL. In simpler terms, it ensures that the modification is made directly to the specified repository and not to a potentially different location that might be redirected from it.'
        no-gpg-verify: |-
            [AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment system for Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. This command allows you to modify the configuration of a remote repository, such as adding or removing repositories or modifying their settings.

            The option `--no-gpg-verify` is used to disable GPG signature verification during the update process. Enabling this flag means that Flatpak will not check the authenticity of the downloaded packages using their signed keys before installing them, which could potentially introduce security risks if malicious packages are present in the repository. It's recommended to use this option only in trusted environments or when you understand the potential risks involved.
        no-use-for-deps: '[AI] The `flatpak remote-modify` command is a utility in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. The `--no-use-for-deps` flag modifies a remote repository by preventing the installation of packages that have dependencies on packages being removed. This means that when you remove a package with its dependencies using this option, only the specified package will be removed, while its dependents remain installed in the system. This can be useful for selectively managing and reducing the size of your system without affecting other installed packages.'
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment platform, to modify configurations of remote repositories. The `--ostree-verbose` option is used with this command for more detailed output when interacting with OSTree-based remote repositories. In simpler terms, it increases the amount and level of detail displayed during the modification process, providing useful information for advanced users or troubleshooting purposes.'
        prio: |-
            [AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment system, to modify various settings of Flatpak remotes, which are repositories or sources for installing and updating Flatpak applications.

            The option `--prio` sets or changes the priority level of a remote, where lower numbers indicate higher priorities. When there are multiple remotes with overlapping packages, the one with the lower priority will be used to satisfy dependencies and installations. This command can be used to change the priority order between different Flatpak repositories.
        subset: |-
            [AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to modify properties of remotes, which are collections of repositories that provide packages for installation. The `--subset` option allows you to limit the modification to a specific subset of keys or properties.

            For instance, if you want to add or remove certain repositories from a remote without affecting other settings, you can use this command:

            ```
            flatpak remote-modify <remote_name> --add / remove <repo_url> --subset reposities
            ```

            This command only modifies the list of repositories for the given remote. By using `--subset`, you ensure that no other properties are unintentionally changed during the modification process.
        system: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command-line utility for Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. The `--system` option specifies that the modifications will be applied to the system''s Flatpak repositories, affecting applications installed for all users. The `remote-modify` command allows various actions such as adding, removing or modifying remotes (repositories), which can include things like changing the URL of a remote or enabling/disabling access to it. For example, `flatpak remote-modify --system <remote_name> add <remote_URL>` would add a new system repository with the given URL.'
        title: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command used with the Flatpak software deployment platform to modify the properties of a remote repository, such as adding or modifying its title. The `--title` option is used in conjunction with this command to specify the new title for the repository. When executed, it changes the title of the specified remote without affecting other properties.'
        update-metadata: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. The `--update-metadata` option modifies the metadata of a remote repository, typically to update or modify its application descriptions (apps). This allows publishers and maintainers to make changes to the information about an app before it is released or installed on systems using that repository. The `--update-metadata` command does not directly affect already installed apps but instead influences the metadata visible to Flatpak clients when they request updates or new installations.'
        url: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command used with the Flatpak package manager to modify the configuration of a remote repository. The `--url` option is used to change the URL of an existing remote. For example, `flatpak remote-modify --url new-repo-url old-repo-name` will update the Flatpak configuration to use the new repository URL instead of the old one when installing or updating packages.'
        use-for-deps: |-
            [AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command-line utility for managing Flatpak remotes, which are repositories of software packages for the Flatpak application platform. The specific option `--use-for-deps` modifies how dependencies are handled when installing or updating packages from that remote.

            When this flag is used, any dependency of a package that is also available in the modified remote will be installed or updated from that remote instead of from other remotes. This can help ensure consistency and simplify the management of dependencies across multiple packages. It's important to note that using this flag may cause circular dependency issues if not used carefully.
        user: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. The `--user` option modifies a remote repository that is configured for use by individual users, rather than system-wide. This means that changes made using this command affect only the current user''s Flatpak installations. By default, Flatpak repositories are set up to be accessible to all users on a system. Therefore, `remote-modify --user` provides a way to manage and update software packages installed for an individual user without affecting others.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak remote-modify` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment system, to modify the configuration of a remote repository or distribution. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output displayed during the operation. When using `flatpak remote-modify --verbose`, the command will print detailed information about each step it takes while modifying the remote, including any error messages that might occur. This can be helpful for debugging and understanding the inner workings of Flatpak repositories.'
