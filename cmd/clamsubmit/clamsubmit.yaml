documentation:
    command: '[AI] "clamsubmit" is a command-line utility used with ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine. It allows users to submit files for virus scanning via the ClamAV Virus Scanner Daemon (clamd). The syntax is typically "clamsubmit <file> <local_socket>", where "<file>" is the path to the file to be scanned and "<local_socket>" is the Unix domain socket used by clamd. This command sends the file to the clamd for scanning and displays the scan results, including any detected viruses or malware.'
    flag:
        '?': '[AI] The `clamsubmit` is a command-line utility for ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine. The option `-?` or `--help` is used to display help information about how to use the `clamsubmit` command correctly. When you run `clamsubmit -?` in your terminal, it will show you a brief usage message and detailed options that are available for the `clamsubmit` command. This helps users understand what arguments they need to provide and how to format them, ensuring proper submission of files or data to ClamAV for virus scanning.'
        "N": '[AI] The command `clamsubmit -N` is used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software suite, to submit a new virus or malware sample for analysis and inclusion into the ClamAV virus definition files. The `-N` option stands for "new" and indicates that the submitted file contains a previously unknown threat. This command assists in maintaining the antivirus solution up-to-date by enabling the community to share and distribute new threats with other users.'
        V: '[AI] `clamsubmit -V` is a command used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, and other malware. This command displays the version information of the installed ClamAV software, including the virus definition database version and the ClamAV daemon or server version. It helps users ensure they are running the latest version of ClamAV for optimal security.'
        d: '[AI] `clamsubmit` is a command-line tool for ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine. The `-d` option stands for "force local scanning", which means that the tool will scan a file locally on the machine where it''s run, without sending the result to a ClamAV virus database server for remote verification. This can be useful when offline or when network connectivity is not available.'
        e: '[AI] The `clamsubmit` command with the `-e` option is used to submit a file for virus scan to the ClamAV virus database in real-time mode. When you run `clamscan` with this option followed by a file, it sends the file''s contents to the ClamAV server for scanning and receives the result back. This can be useful when you want to check a suspicious file without having to download or install new virus definitions on your local system.'
        h: '[AI] `clamsubmit` is a command-line tool for submitting files to the ClamAV antivirus scanning service. The `-h` option is used to display help information about how to use the `clamsubmit` command. This includes details on the required arguments (such as the path to the file to be scanned), optional arguments, and examples of usage.'
        "n": '[AI] The `clamsubmit` command is a tool for submitting files to the ClamAV antivirus scanning system. The option `-n <filename>` instructs it to submit only the specified file for scanning, without scanning the standard input or the current directory. In other words, this option is used when you want to scan a specific file and not the whole directory.'
        p: |-
            [AI] The `clamsubmit` command with the option `-p` is used to submit a file or files to ClamAV, an open source antivirus engine, for scanning and virus definition updates. The `-p` option specifies the ClamAV Virus Scanner daemon's Unix domain socket or remote address and port number where the submission will be made. For example, if the daemon is running on localhost at the default port 33102, the command would look like:

            ```bash
            clamsubmit -p /var/run/clamav/socket:33102 <filename>
            ```
        v: '[AI] `clamsubmit -v` is a command-line tool for Clam Antivirus, an open-source antivirus engine. The `-v` flag stands for "verbose" mode. When used with this option, the tool provides detailed information about each scanned file during the antivirus scan process. This includes the name of the scanned file, its size, the scan result (clean or infected), and the name of any detected malware or virus definition triggering the scan result.'
