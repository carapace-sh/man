description: Generate the certificate for the API server to connect to kubelet
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save and store the certificates.
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubernetes-version=: Choose a specific Kubernetes version for the control plane.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm init` command with the `phase certs apiserver-kubelet-client` argument is used to generate and configure TLS certificates for the Kubernetes API server, kubelet, and client communication in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. This is an important step during the initial setup of a Kubernetes cluster as it ensures secure communication between these components.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: |-
            [AI] The `kubeadm init` command with the `phase certs apiserver-kubelet-client --cert-dir` option is used to generate and configure TLS certificates for various components in a Kubernetes cluster, specifically for the apiserver, kubelet, and client communication.

            The `--cert-dir` flag specifies the directory where these certificates will be stored. During this phase of initialization, `kubeadm` generates a root CA certificate, as well as server-client and client-client certificates and keys. The apiserver-kubelet-client certificates are used for secure communication between the Kubernetes apiserver and kubelets in worker nodes.

            The generated certificates will be placed inside the specified directory (`--cert-dir`) in the following subdirectories:

            * `ca.crt`: Root Certificate Authority file.
            * `server.crt` and `server.key`: TLS certificate and private key for the apiserver.
            * `kubelet.crt` and `kubelet.key`: TLS certificate and private key for the kubelets.
            * `client.crt` and `client.key`: Client certificates for communication with the apiserver.

            These generated certificates are essential in securing your Kubernetes cluster by encrypting all communication between components.
        config: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line utility for initializing a Kubernetes cluster. The specific option `phase certs apiserver-kubelet-client` instructs `kubeadm` to generate and print the certificates needed for the communication between the Apiserver, Kubelet, and Client components in a Kubernetes cluster. These certificates are crucial for secure communication within the cluster environment. The `--config` flag specifies that the output of this command should be saved to the provided configuration file instead of directly applying it.'
        kubernetes-version: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase certs` argument under the `init` command is used to generate and configure TLS certificates for various components of the Kubernetes control plane, including the apiserver, kubelet, and client.

            The `--kubernetes-version` flag specifies which version of Kubernetes to use when generating these certificates, ensuring they are compatible with the chosen version of the cluster. Once generated, these certificates are placed in the appropriate locations for the various components to securely communicate with each other.
