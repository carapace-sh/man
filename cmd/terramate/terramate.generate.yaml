    command: '[AI] `terramate generate` is a command used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, to initiate the creation of new resources and modules based on existing configuration files or templates. It scans the given directory for valid Terraform configurations and creates the necessary files and directories using the specified input. This command simplifies the process of starting a new Terraform project by providing a solid foundation to build upon.'

            [AI] `terraform generate` is a command in Hashicorp's Terraform configuration management tool. The `--detailed-exit-code` flag is an option that provides more detailed exit codes when the command fails.

            When `terraform generate` is run without any error, it returns an exit code of 0, indicating success. However, if there are errors during the generation process (such as missing required inputs or configuration syntax issues), it will return a non-zero exit code to indicate failure.

            By using the `--detailed-exit-code` flag, Terraform provides more information about the nature of the error by returning a detailed exit code. For instance, an exit code of 1 could mean that there were provider configuration errors, while an exit code of 2 could indicate validation errors within your Terraform configuration files. This can help in diagnosing and resolving issues during the generation process.
