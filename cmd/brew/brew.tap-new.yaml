        [AI] `brew tap-new` is not a valid Homebrew (MacOS package manager) command. The closest commands to what you might be looking for are:

        1. `brew tap <username>/<repository>`: This command adds a new Homebrew Tap, which is a remote repository of Homebrew formulae, to your local installation. It allows you to install software not available in the default Homebrew repositories.

        2. `brew create <username>/<repository>`: This command creates a new Homebrew Formula in a local git repository under the given username and repository name. You would use this if you want to contribute a new formula to Homebrew. It does not add the tap to your system, just creates the formula locally.

        3. `brew install <formula-name>`: This command installs a formula using Homebrew, regardless of whether it's available in the default repositories or a custom tap.
    flag:
        branch: '[AI] `brew tap new --branch` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command creates a new repository under Homebrew''s tap (short for "technology access program") system. The `--new` flag initializes a new Git repository, and the `--branch` flag sets up the repository as a new branch based on the current master branch. When you push this new branch to a remote repository, it can be tapped by Homebrew to install custom packages from that repository.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew tap new --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command creates a new Homebrew tap (repository where Homebrew can fetch custom formulae) with the `--debug` flag enabling more detailed output during the creation process. It helps developers to debug any potential issues when setting up a new Homebrew tap.'
        github-packages: '[AI] `brew tap-new --github-packages` is a Homebrew (a popular package manager for macOS) command used to add a new GitHub repository as a tap (short for "testapity", an alias for a Homebrew tap). This specific command is used to configure Homebrew to install packages directly from GitHub Packages, which is GitHub''s package registry. By running `brew tap-new --github-packages`, you are telling Homebrew to create a new tap with the given URL (the GitHub Packages repository) and link it for future usage. This allows you to easily install third-party packages that aren''t part of the default Homebrew repositories.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `brew tap new` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command creates a new Homebrew tap, which is a remote repository where custom Homebrew formulae can be stored and shared. The `--help` flag displays detailed help information about this command, including the syntax, available options, and their meanings. For example:

            ```bash
            Usage: brew tap [options] <name>

            Create a new Homebrew tap, with an initial directory at <path/to/new_tap>.

            Options:
              --help                         Show this help message and exit.
              --version                      Show version information and exit.
              --prefix PREFIX                Install Homebrew into PREFIX instead of /usr/local.
              --no-check-prior-install        Skip checking for existing installations when creating a new tap.
              --name NAME                    Set the name for this new tap (defaults to current Git repository).
              --description DESCRIPTION      Set the description for this new tap.
              --maintainer MAINTAINER         Set the maintainer for this new tap.
              --url URL                      Set the URL for this new tap's Homebrew formulae.
            ```

            This help message shows that `--help` is used to display detailed information about creating a new Homebrew tap, including available options such as setting the name, description, maintainer, and repository URL for the new tap.
        no-git: '[AI] `brew tap new --no-git` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux. This command creates a new Homebrew Tap repository without cloning an existing Git repository. A Homebrew Tap is a repository that contains Homebrew Formulae, which are instructions on how to build and install software packages using Homebrew. The `--no-git` flag tells Homebrew not to clone the Git repository associated with the Tap when creating it, which can be useful if you prefer to manage your custom Formulas locally or have specific versioning requirements.'
        pull-label: |-
            [AI] `brew tap new --pull-label` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The command performs two actions:

            1. `tap new`: This creates a new Homebrew Tap, which is a repository where custom Homebrew formulae are stored. It initializes a new Git repository and sets it up to be used by Homebrew.
            2. `--pull-label`: This option pulls an existing tap and renames or replaces the label (the name that identifies the tap in Homebrew's configuration) with a new one specified as an argument. It's useful when you want to update the name of an existing tap while keeping its contents.
        quiet: '[AI] `brew tap-new` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command creates a new Homebrew tap, which is a repository where custom Homebrew formulas can be stored and shared. The `--quiet` flag is an option that suppresses informational messages during the creation process, making the command run more quietly without printing out progress updates to the terminal.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew tap new --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command creates a new Homebrew tap (repository), which allows users to install third-party Homebrew formulas. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output during the process, providing detailed information about each step in creating and authenticating the new tap.'
