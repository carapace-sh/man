    command: '[AI] The `tmux list-commands` command is used within the Tmux terminal multiplexer environment to display a list of attached, detached, and session-linked commands. Each line in the output represents a window, with columns indicating the window index, session name, window title, and the command running in that window. This command can be useful for quickly identifying and managing sessions and windows within Tmux.'
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `tmux list-commands` is a tmux command used to list all the sessions, windows, and panes in a Tmux environment. The `-F` option modifies the output format of this command. Instead of displaying the default session ID, window ID, and pane IDs, it allows you to specify a custom output format using a template string. This can be useful for filtering or processing the output in scripts or other automation tasks. For example, `tmux list-commands -F "#{session_name} #{window_id}:#{window_title}"` would display session names and window titles instead of IDs.'
