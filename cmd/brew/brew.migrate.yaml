documentation:
    command: '[AI] `brew migrate` is a Homebrew command used to transfer installed Homebrew formulas and their dependencies from one Mac system to another. It reads the `/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/taps` directory for the formula repositories, then downloads and installs the missing formulas and their dependencies on the target system. This can be useful when setting up a new machine with similar software configurations.'
    flag:
        cask: '[AI] `brew migrate --cask` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command facilitates the migration of Cask installations to the new Homebrew Cellar format. Cask is an extension to Homebrew, enabling the installation of macOS applications and large binary files that cannot be installed via traditional packages. The `--cask` option specifies the migration of only Cask installations. This command helps keep Homebrew up-to-date by transitioning older Cask installations to the more efficient Cellar format.'
        debug: |-
            [AI] `brew migrate --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command initiates a database migration with debug mode enabled.

            When you run `brew upgrade`, Homebrew might ask you to perform database migrations for certain installed packages. The `migrate` sub-command handles this task. The `--debug` flag turns on debugging mode, which increases the amount of output and can provide more detailed information during the migration process, helping to diagnose potential issues.
        dry-run: '[AI] `brew migrate --dry-run` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command performs a dry run of a Homebrew migration, which is the process of updating Homebrew''s internal data structures to prepare for installing or upgrading software packages. The `--dry-run` flag simulates the changes that would be made without actually applying them, allowing users to preview the effects before committing to the migration.'
        force: '[AI] The `brew migrate --force` command is used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to forcefully update the Homebrew installation and its formulae to the latest versions. The `--force` flag overrides any potential version pinning or other constraints that may be in place in the current configuration. By using this command, users accept the risk of potential breaking changes or compatibility issues with their existing installed packages. It is recommended to use this command with caution and only when necessary.'
        formula: |-
            [AI] `brew migrate --formula` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command facilitates the migration of Homebrew formulae between different Homebrew installations or versions.

            The `--formula` option specifies that only the formula (the metadata file defining a package) should be migrated, not the installed packages themselves. Formula migration is useful when updating Homebrew configurations or moving between systems while preserving customized packages and their dependencies.
        help: '[AI] `brew migrate --help` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command displays detailed help information about the `brew migrate` sub-command. It assists users in managing their Homebrew installations by performing various tasks such as upgrading existing installations or installing new ones from older versions, resolving potential dependency conflicts, and maintaining compatibility with different macOS versions. Using `--help` provides a clear and concise explanation of the available options, usage examples, and other relevant information to help users effectively employ `brew migrate`.'
        quiet: '[AI] `brew migrate --quiet` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command triggers Homebrew''s built-in migration tool to update and adapt your Homebrew installation configuration to the latest schema. The `--quiet` flag is used to suppress informational messages and only display error messages if any occur during the process. It helps keep terminal output clean while performing the upgrade.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew migrate --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command triggers a database migration operation with detailed output. When you run this command, Homebrew checks for available upgrades or migrations for installed packages in its formulae repository and applies them to the local Homebrew configuration file (named `Homebrew.mxcl`). The `--verbose` option increases the level of output detail, displaying progress messages and any error information that may arise during the migration process.'
