    command: '[AI] `gh project item-add` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to add an item, such as an issue or pull request, to a specified GitHub Project. The basic usage requires specifying the project ID and the number or title of the item to be added. For example: `gh project add <PROJECT_ID> <ISSUE_NUMBER_OR_PR_NUMBER_OR_TITLE>`. This command requires authentication with GitHub using a valid access token, SSH key, or other supported methods.'

        format: '[AI] `gh project item-add --format` is a command used in the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, `gh`. This command adds a new project item to an existing GitHub Project using the specified format for the response output. The `--format` option allows users to customize the output format of the response data returned by the command.'
        jq: '[AI] `gh project item-add --jq` is a command used with GitHub''s `git-hub` CLI tool. This command adds a new item to a GitHub Project, and the `--jq` option enables using JSON queries (via `jq` command-line processor) to manipulate the response data after creation. In short, it creates a project item with custom properties as defined in the provided JSON query.'
        owner: '[AI] `gh project item-add` is a GitHub CLI command used to add an item (an issue, pull request, or project board card) to a specific project in your GitHub account. The `--owner` flag specifies the owner of the project, which could be either your personal account or another GitHub user account. By including this flag, you ensure that the command operates on the correct project belonging to the specified owner.'
        template: |-
            [AI] The `gh project item-add --template` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new file or directory in a GitHub Project using a specified template.

            Here's a breakdown of the command:

            * `gh`: This is the GitHub Command Line tool name.
            * `project`: This is a subcommand that manages your GitHub Projects.
            * `item-add`: This is a subcommand for adding new items (files or directories) to a project.
            * `--template`: This option specifies that you want to use an existing template as a starting point for the new item. You can provide a repository, organization, or personal template in the format `<username>/<repository>/<path>`.

            In summary, this command creates a new item in your GitHub Project using an existing template as a base.
        url: '[AI] `gh project item-add --url` is a command in GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, called `gh`, used to add a new project item with a provided URL to the current GitHub project. This operation does not create or modify any code files, but rather adds an entry under the "Projects" tab in your GitHub repository page. The command takes only one argument: `--url` followed by the URL of the project you want to add.'
