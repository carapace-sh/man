    command: |-
        [AI] `git symbolic-ref` is a Git command used to update or read the content of a ref (short for reference), which is a variable in Git that stores the pointer to a specific commit. The command manipulates symbolic references, i.e., references with names like branches and tags, rather than raw file references. By default, it reads the value of a given ref, but you can also update the ref by providing a new commit hash or branch name as an argument. For example:

        - To read the current head of the master branch: `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD`
        - To set the master branch to point to a new commit: `git symbolic-ref master <new_commit>`
    flag:
        delete: '[AI] `git symbolic-ref --delete` is a Git command used to delete or reset a named reference (a branch or tag) to detached HEAD or nothing. When you run this command followed by the name of a ref, Git removes the reference and effectively resets the tip of the branch or tag to the current HEAD. If the referenced branch or tag doesn''t exist, no action is taken. This command can be useful when you want to delete or reset local branches before fetching new changes or when working with remote repositories.'
        m: '[AI] `git symbolic-ref` is a command used to manage and manipulate Git references, which are pointers to specific commit hashIDs in a Git repository. The `-m` option stands for "force update," meaning it will replace an existing reference with a new one without prompting for confirmation. This can be useful when updating a branch or tag reference that may have been outdated due to concurrent changes by other users. By default, Git ref updates fail if the new reference points to a different commit than the current one; `-m` option overrides this behavior and updates the reference regardless.'
        quiet: '[AI] `git symbolic-ref --quiet` is a Git command used to update or read the content of a ref (a reference to a commit in Git) without displaying any output. The `--quiet` option suppresses any messages that would normally be displayed, making it useful when you want to execute the command in scripts or automated workflows where silent execution is desired.'
        short: '[AI] `git symbolic-ref --short` is a Git command used to get the abbreviated name of the branch or commit that a given reference points to. In other words, it returns the last part of a ref''s value, which is typically the branch or tag name. This can be useful when writing scripts or dealing with multiple references to the same commit or branch.'
