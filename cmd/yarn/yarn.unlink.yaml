    command: '[AI] The `yarn unlink` command is used to remove a saved dependency in the Yarn cache, disassociating it from your project. When you run `npm link` or `yarn link` to create a symbolic link between a package and its linked version, `yarn unlink` can be used to undo that linkage. This is useful when testing or working on different versions of a dependency within the same project.'

            [AI] `yarn unlink --all` is a command used in Yarn package manager to remove all hard-linked references to global packages installed in your project. When you install a global package using Yarn with the `--global` flag, it gets installed into your local `node_modules` folder as well, creating a hard link between the two installations.

            The `yarn unlink --all` command removes these hard links, effectively unlinking or "uninstalling" the global packages from your project while keeping them installed globally on your machine for other projects to use. This can be useful when you want to ensure that only the globally installed package version is used across all your projects and not a specific version installed in any one project.
