documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git remote rename` is a Git command used to change the name of an existing remote repository in your local Git configuration. The basic syntax is: `git remote rename <old_name> <new_name>`. This command updates the name of the remote origin without modifying the underlying URL. For instance, if you want to rename the remote named "origin" to "myremote", use: `git remote rename origin myremote`.'
