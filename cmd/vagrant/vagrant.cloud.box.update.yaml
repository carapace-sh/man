    command: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud box update` command is used to check for and optionally update local copies of Vagrantbox images, which are preconfigured virtual machines, stored in Vagrant Cloud. This command interacts with the Vagrant Cloud API to retrieve available updates and metadata for specified boxes, allowing you to keep your local boxes up-to-date. It''s important to note that using this command doesn''t directly affect running VMs or your project setup. Instead, it''s a tool for managing and updating the box definitions in your Vagrantfile and local cache.'

        description: '[AI] `vagrant cloud box update` is a command used with Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machines. The `--description` option is provided to update the description of an existing box (virtual machine image) in the Vagrant Cloud registry. This command allows you to modify the metadata associated with your box version. Use it to keep your box information accurate and up-to-date, ensuring other users can easily find and use your shared boxes.'
        no-private: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud box update --no-private` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments, to update all non-private boxes (boxes publicly available on the Vagrant Cloud) installed on your local system with their latest versions. By using the `--no-private` flag, you are excluding private boxes (those that have been shared with you or uploaded by yourself) from the update process. This command helps keep your environment up-to-date with the most recent publicly available box configurations.'
        private: '[AI] `vagrant cloud box update --private` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command instructs Vagrant to update locally stored private boxes in the Vagrant Cloud repository with their latest versions. Private boxes are customized virtual machines or containers created by users and shared privately within an organization or team. By running `box update --private`, you ensure that your local environment uses the most up-to-date configurations, software, and security patches for your private boxes.'
        short-description: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud box update` command is used to update a specific Vagrant box from the Vagrant Cloud repository. The `--short-description` option displays a brief description of the updated box version, without showing other details like its provider or URL. This allows you to quickly see what changes were made in the new version of the box.'
