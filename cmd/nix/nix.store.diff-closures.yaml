documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nix store diff-closures` command is a Nix expression that calculates the differences between two sets of Nix store closures, which are collections of installed packages and their corresponding versions managed by Nix. The output of this command is a list of differences, including added, removed, and modified closures, along with their respective hashes and paths. It helps in identifying changes made to the Nix store environment between two points in time.'
    flag:
        arg: '[AI] The `nix store diff-closures --arg` command is a Nix expression used to compute the difference between two Nix store closure hashes. The `diff-closures` function calculates the differences between the file trees of two closures, and the `--arg` option is used to specify the two closure arguments. The output of this command is a list of differences, including affected files and their modifications (additions, deletions, or modifications).'
        argstr: '[AI] The `nix store diff-closures --argstr` command is a Nix expression that generates a difference between two Nix store closures. A closure is a snapshot of a set of packages and their dependencies at a particular point in time. By using the `--argstr` option with `diff-closures`, you can pass arguments to the command, which can be used to filter or specify the differences you want to see between the two closures. The output will show the changes made to the package trees, including additions, removals, and modifications.'
        commit-lock-file: '[AI] The `nix store diff-closures --commit-lock-file` command is a Nix expression that calculates and displays the differences between two commit lock files (representing different states of a Nix store) in terms of the closed expressions (i.e., packages and their builds or configuration settings). This helps identify which packages or configurations have been added, modified, or removed between those two states. The output is typically compared using a diff tool for better visualization. The `--commit-lock-file` option specifies that both input files are commit lock files.'
        debug: '[AI] `nix store diff-closures --debug` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command generates a debug output showing the difference between two Nix store closures. A closure is a snapshot of a set of packages and their dependencies at a specific point in time. The `diff-closures` tool compares two such closures and outputs the differences between them, including added, removed, or modified files. By using the `--debug` flag, it provides more detailed debug information about the comparison process.'
        debugger: |-
            [AI] The `nix store diff-closures --debugger` command is a Nix expression used to compare and analyze differences between two Nix store closures.

            A Nix store closure is a snapshot of a Nix system's package tree at a specific point in time. This command helps identify changes between two such snapshots by showing the differences between the packages they contain, as well as providing debugging information.

            When executed with the `--debugger` flag, it starts an interactive debugging session where you can inspect the differences and explore the affected packages in detail. The output includes detailed information about each added, removed, or modified package, including their names, version numbers, and file changes.
        eval-store: '[AI] The `nix store diff-closures --eval-store` command is a Nix expression that calculates the differences between two Nix store closures (a snapshot of the Nix package manager''s files at a specific point in time). It prints out a list of added, modified, and deleted files between the two closures. The `--eval-store` option evaluates the given expression directly against the store rather than reading it from a file.'
        impure: '[AI] The `nix store diff-closures --impure` command is a Nix expression that calculates the difference between two Nix store closures, which are collections of built packages and their derivations. The `--impure` option enables the comparison of impure closures, allowing differences in file modifications and symlink targets to be detected. In practical terms, it shows the changes made to a Nix environment between two snapshots.'
        include: '[AI] The `nix store diff-closures --include` command is a Nix expression used to compute the differences between two Nix store closures, which are snapshot collections of packages and their dependencies in the Nix Package Manager. The `--include` option specifies a list of closure paths to be included in the comparison. The resulting output is a diff showing added, modified, or deleted files and directories between the two closures.'
        inputs-from: |-
            [AI] The `nix store diff-closures --inputs-from` command is a Nix expression that calculates the difference between two sets of Nix Store closures. Specifically, it compares the set of closures generated by building certain inputs with the set of closures that were previously built.

            The `--inputs-from` option specifies the Nix Expressions or paths to the input builds whose closures should be used for comparison. The command outputs the differences between the two sets of closures, which can help in identifying what has changed between the two builds and what new or updated packages have been installed.

            In summary, `nix store diff-closures --inputs-from` is a Nix command that calculates the difference between the closure sets generated by building specified inputs, helping to identify changes in installed packages.
        log-format: '[AI] `nix store diff-closures` is a command from Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This command computes the difference between two snapshot closures in the Nix store, which are identified by their hash values. The `--log-format` option specifies the format of the output log, which includes the differences between the two closures, such as added, deleted, or modified files and their corresponding paths. The log also shows the commit messages associated with each change if they are available.'
        no-registries: |-
            [AI] The `nix store diff-closures --no-registries` command is a utility provided by Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command generates a difference report between two snapshot trees in the Nix store, which is Nix's local repository of software packages and their dependencies.

            The `--no-registries` option tells Nix to exclude data from the remote Nixpkgs registry when generating the diff report. In other words, it compares only the local changes between two snapshot trees without considering any potential differences in remote repositories or external dependencies. This can be useful for comparing and tracking changes within a local development environment or between different branches of a project without being affected by external factors.
        no-update-lock-file: |-
            [AI] The `nix store diff-closures --no-update-lock-file` command is a Nix expression used to compute differences between two Nix store closure trees without updating or creating new lock files.

            A Nix store is a file system hierarchy where Nix builds and stores its packages, allowing for efficient and consistent package management. A closure is a tree of files that captures the complete state of a Nix expression at build time.

            The `diff-closures` command computes the differences between two closure trees, showing which files have been added, removed, or modified. The `--no-update-lock-file` option prevents the creation or updating of lock files during the operation.

            Lock files ensure that multiple builds using the same Nix expression produce consistent results by ensuring that the same input closures are used for each build. However, when comparing closure trees, we do not want to update or create new lock files as they may interfere with the comparison process. Therefore, using `--no-update-lock-file` is necessary to obtain accurate and reliable differences between the two closure trees.
        no-write-lock-file: '[AI] The `nix store diff-closures --no-write-lock-file` command is a Nix expression used to compute the differences between two Nix store closure trees without modifying or creating new lock files. A Nix store is a local file system repository storing software packages managed by Nix, and a closure tree represents all the dependencies of a specific package and its version in the store. The `--no-write-lock-file` option instructs the command to not create or modify existing lock files during the comparison process. This can be useful when comparing closure trees for analysis or troubleshooting purposes without affecting the actual Nix stores.'
        override-flake: '[AI] `nix store diff-closures --override-flake` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command calculates the differences between two snapshots of a Nix store, which is a database of software packages managed by Nix. The `--diff-closures` option generates a difference report of the closure sets (i.e., the complete set of files required to build and run a package). The `--override-flake` flag tells Nix to use the flake build system, which allows building and managing reproducible projects with multiple source code repositories and dependencies. In essence, this command compares the differences in closure sets when using different snapshots of packages managed by Nix under the flake build system.'
        override-input: '[AI] `nix store diff-closures --override-input` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This command calculates and displays the differences between two Nix store closures, which are snapshots of the system''s software environment. The `--override-input` option allows specifying a different input path for one or more inputs to the closure being compared, enabling comparison of closures with different versions or configurations of their components.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] The `nix store diff-closures --print-build-logs` command is a Nix expression used to generate build logs for differences between two Nix store closure trees. This command compares the build logs of the two closures and prints out the differences. It helps in identifying which builds have changed, what the differences are, and can be useful for tracking changes in a Nix environment or package build process.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `nix store diff-closures --quiet` command is a Nix expression that calculates and displays the differences between two Nix store closure hashes in a quiet mode, meaning it will output only the hash differences without any additional explanatory text. The Nix store is a part of the Nix Package Manager''s infrastructure for managing and distributing packages. Closures are snapshots of the system state at a specific point in time, including all installed packages and their versions. By comparing closure hashes, you can identify what has changed between two states.'
        recreate-lock-file: '[AI] `nix store diff-closures --recreate-lock-file` is a Nix expression that calculates the differences between two Nix store snapshots (closures) and recreates or updates the lock file for the new closure. The Nix store is where Nix manages all installed packages, and closures are an efficient data structure used to represent a snapshot of the store. The `--recreate-lock-file` option ensures that a new lock file is created when applying the differences between the two snapshots, helping to maintain reproducibility and consistency in package installations.'
        update-input: '[AI] The `nix store diff-closures --update-input` command is a Nix expression that calculates the differences between two snapshots of the Nix Store, which is Nix OS''s package repository. More specifically, it computes the delta closures of the inputs to the build processes between the two snapshots, updating the inputs if necessary. The resulting difference information can then be used to create patch files or apply changes to update one snapshot to match the other.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `nix store diff-closures --verbose` command is a Nix expression that computes and displays the difference between two closure sets in Nix, which is a package management system. A closure set is a collection of outputs (built packages) and their build inputs. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output displayed during the comparison process, providing more detailed information about the differences found.'
