documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker manifest push` is a Docker CLI command used to transfer a built Docker image manifest to a container registry, updating an existing image or creating a new one if it doesn''t exist. The command takes as arguments the image name and tag, followed by the registry URL and authentication information (if needed). Once executed, the manifest file containing metadata about the layers and their digest values is sent to the registry for storage and access by other clients.'
    flag:
        insecure: '[AI] The `docker manifest push --insecure` command is used to push a Docker image manifest to a registry over an insecure connection. The manifest contains metadata about the image, such as its configuration, layers, and digests. By using the `--insecure` flag, the command bypasses SSL certificate validation when connecting to the registry, which can be useful in certain situations where certificate verification is not possible or desirable. However, it''s important to note that using insecure connections carries a risk of data interception and manipulation. Therefore, it should only be used with caution and appropriate security measures in place.'
        purge: '[AI] The `docker manifest push --purge` command is used to push a new Docker image manifest to a registry, replacing any existing manifest with the same tag or name. The `--purge` option ensures that any previously existing manifests with matching tags or names are deleted before the new one is pushed. This can be useful when making significant changes to an image and wanting to ensure that only the latest version is available in the registry.'
