documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dmenu` is a lightweight and highly configurable interactive menu for the X Window System. It allows users to type in their selection while displaying possible completions, making it an efficient tool for launching applications or performing various tasks. Users can customize its appearance, behavior, and functionality through configuration files.'
    flag:
        b: '[AI] `dmenu` is a dynamic menu for X, which allows you to type to filter a list of items. The `-b` flag stands for "borderless" mode in `dmenu`. In this mode, the menu will be displayed without any borders around the individual menu entries. This can give a cleaner look and can be useful when integrating `dmenu` into custom scripts or configurations.'
        f: '[AI] `dmenu` is a graphical application launcher for Unix-like operating systems. The option `-f` sets the flag for fuzzy matching in `dmenu`. With this flag, `dmenu` accepts partial input and tries to find the best match based on the context of the input. It''s useful when you can''t remember the exact name of a program or file but know part of it. This feature makes `dmenu` more user-friendly and efficient.'
        fn: '[AI] `dmenu` is a versatile, dynamic menu for the X Window System. The option `-fn` sets the font name used by `dmenu`. For example, `dmenu -fn "Monospace 12"` would use the Monospace font with size 12 in the `dmenu` interface. This can help customize the appearance of the menu to the user''s preference.'
        h: '[AI] `dmenu` is a versatile Linux application that allows users to create customizable interfaces for various tasks, such as launching applications or navigating files and directories. The `-h` option that appears before the `dmenu` command in the flag `dmenu -h`, stands for "help." When used, this option displays a brief help message about the available features and usage of `dmenu`. Therefore, using `dmenu -h` will provide the user with essential information on how to effectively utilize the application.'
        i: '[AI] `dmenu` is a dynamic menu for X11, which allows users to type in their selection and provides real-time feedback. The `-i` flag stands for "interactive", meaning that when using this option, the user''s input will be required to complete an action or make a selection from the presented options. This makes it ideal for use cases where there are numerous possibilities and you want to give the user the most control over their choice.'
        l: '[AI] `dmenu` is a dynamic menu for x86 Linux and BSD systems. The option `-l` sets the length of the lines in the menu. For example, `dmenu -l 10` would create a menu with each line containing up to 10 characters. This can help ensure that long items are wrapped correctly and fit within the terminal window or other display area.'
        m: '[AI] `dmenu` is a versatile, terminal-based interactive application launcher for Unix and Linux systems. The `-m` option is used to set the text that appears at the top of the menu created by `dmenu`. This can be useful for providing instructions or context for the user when selecting items from the menu. For example, if you''re using `dmenu` to launch applications, you might use `-m "Application Launcher"` to display this text at the top of the menu.'
        nb: '[AI] `dmenu` is a flexible, configurable interactive menu for Unix-like operating systems. The option `-nb` sets the background color of the menu to none (transparent), which can be useful when running the menu in a terminal with a visually appealing background. This allows the underlying terminal background to show through the dmenu window, creating a seamless look.'
        nf: '[AI] `dmenu` is a dynamic, flexible, and highly configurable application launcher for Unix-like operating systems. The option `-nf` stands for "no file completion." When used with `dmenu`, it prevents the suggestion of file completions as you type in the prompt. This can be useful if you want to use `dmenu` primarily for launching applications or executing commands, without the distraction of file suggestions.'
        p: '[AI] `dmenu` is a dynamic, flexible and efficient interactive menu for the X Window System. The `-p` option sets a prompt string that appears above the list of items in the menu. When using this option, the user types their selection in response to the prompt instead of navigating through the menu with arrow keys or other input methods. This can be useful for specific use cases where quick text input is desired.'
        sb: '[AI] `dmenu` is a powerful and flexible interactive terminal application for creating text-based menus in Unix-like operating systems. The option `-sb` sets the background color of the menu using an RGB or HTML color code. For example, `-sb red` would set the background color to red. This can be useful for making the menu stand out or for better visibility in certain environments.'
        sf: '[AI] `dmenu` is a dynamic, flexible and efficient interactive menu for x86 Linux and BSD systems. The `-sf` flag is a shortcut option for `--separator-file`. It allows you to set a custom file containing characters or images used as separators between menu items when the menu is displayed.'
        v: '[AI] `dmenu` is a versatile, flexible and highly configurable command-line utility for creating interactive menus in the Unix terminal. The option `-v` or `--verify` is one of its features. When used, it requires the user to confirm their selection by pressing Enter key twice instead of once. This provides an additional layer of verification, reducing the risk of unintentional choices.'
        w: '[AI] `dmenu` is a versatile, interactive text-based menu for Unix-like operating systems. The `-w` option is a parameter that sets the width of the menu window in characters. This means that when you run a command with `dmenu -w <width>`, it will open a window with the specified width to display the menu items, making it easier to choose an option when space is limited or when working in a terminal with a smaller screen size.'
        x: '[AI] `dmenu` is a powerful and flexible interactive terminal application for managing and launching applications, working with files, or running commands. The `-x` flag is an option that can be passed to `dmenu`. It stands for "exit on enter." With this flag, once the user selects an item from the list displayed by `dmenu`, the application will exit immediately instead of waiting for another key press. This can be useful when integrating `dmenu` into scripts or custom workflows where quick exits are desired.'
        "y": '[AI] `dmenu` is a lightweight and flexible interactive command-line tool for creating menus in the X Window System. The option `-y` tells `dmenu` to display the menu items vertically, with each selection highlighted in reverse video. When an item is selected by using the arrow keys or the mouse, the selection is copied to the clipboard and can be pasted into a terminal for execution.'
