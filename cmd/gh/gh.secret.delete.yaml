documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh secret delete` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to delete a GitHub Secret from your local machine or a GitHub repository. When you run this command, you need to specify the name of the secret to be deleted either by providing its path in your GitHub repository or using the `--id` or `--name` flags followed by the secret''s ID or name. Once executed, the secret will be removed from your local GitHub Secret Cache and, if used with the `--force` flag, it will also be deleted permanently from your repository.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] `gh secret delete --app` is a command used with GitHub''s `git-hub` CLI tool (also known as `gh`). This command deletes a GitHub Secret of the specified application. The `--app` flag indicates that the secret to be deleted is associated with an application in GitHub, rather than an organization or a personal access token.'
        env: '[AI] The `gh secret delete --env` command is used with GitHub''s `git-hub` CLI tool to delete an environment variable secret from a GitHub repository. This command deletes the specified secret environment variable and removes it from the GitHub repository, making it no longer accessible.'
        org: '[AI] The command `gh secret delete --org` is used with GitHub''s Git Hub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, `gh`. This command deletes a secret in GitHub under the given organization. The `--org` flag specifies that the operation should be performed on the named organization rather than the default one associated with the user.'
        user: '[AI] The `gh secret delete` command is a part of the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) toolkit, specifically designed to manage encrypted GitHub Secrets. The `--user` flag is an optional argument that specifies deletion of a secret belonging to a specific GitHub user or organization, rather than the current authenticated user. For example, `gh secret delete <secret-name> --user <username>` will delete the specified secret for the provided username. If no user is specified, the command will delete the secret associated with the currently authenticated user.'
