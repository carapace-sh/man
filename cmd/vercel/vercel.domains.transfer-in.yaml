description: Transfer in a domain to Vercel
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vercel domains transfer-in` command is used in the Vercel platform to initiate the process of transferring an existing domain name from another DNS provider to Vercel for hosting and management. This command sets the transfer process in motion, after which the domain owner will receive instructions on how to complete the transfer by updating their DNS records at their current registrar. The result is a fully managed domain hosted on the Vercel platform with seamless integration of deployments and automatic SSL certificates.'
