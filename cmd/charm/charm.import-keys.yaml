documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `charms import-keys` command is used in Charms, which are configuration management packages for Juju, a service orchestration tool. This command imports public SSH keys from a given file into the authorized_keys file of a specific user on a Charm''s container. This allows the specified user to authenticate with that key when connecting via SSH, making it easier to manage and secure access to the containers in your Juju environment.'
    flag:
        force-overwrite: '[AI] The `charms` command with the option `import-keys --force-overwrite` is used in Charms, a configuration management tool for OpenStack and other applications on Ubuntu. This command imports an existing GPG key into your local Juju trust store, overwriting any existing key with the same ID without asking for confirmation. This can be useful when you have accidentally lost the trust store or need to import a new key that has the same ID as one already present in the trust store. However, using this command without caution may result in importing an incorrect or malicious key into your trust store, compromising the security of your Juju environment.'
