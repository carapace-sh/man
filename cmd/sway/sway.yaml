documentation:
    command: '[AI] "Sway" is a tiling window manager for Wayland compositors. It allows users to manage and arrange windows in multiple tiled views, maximizing use of available screen space. It provides features like keyboard shortcuts for moving and resizing windows, workspace management, and integration with various external tools. Sway offers a modern, efficient, and flexible alternative to traditional desktop environments.'
    flag:
        config: '[AI] `sway` is a tiling window manager for Wayland, and its configuration file can be manipulated using the command `sway --config`. This command opens the Sway configuration file in your default text editor or IDE for modification. The changes made to the file will take effect once you save and restart the Sway window manager.'
        debug: |-
            [AI] The `sway` command with the `--debug` flag is used to start the Sway window manager with debug mode enabled. This allows for more detailed output and diagnostic information to be displayed, which can be helpful in troubleshooting configuration issues or other problems with the Sway setup.

            When run, Sway will print additional messages and details about its behavior and interactions with other system components, making it easier to understand what is happening behind the scenes. This information can be viewed in various logs or output streams, depending on how the command is invoked.

            The `--debug` flag should only be used when necessary, as it can generate a significant amount of additional output that may obscure normal system activity and clutter the terminal or log files. In production use, the flag should generally be omitted to keep things running smoothly.
        get-socketpath: '[AI] `sway` is a tiling window manager for Wayland, and the command `sway --get-socketpath` returns the Unix domain socket path used by Sway to communicate with its compositor and other components. This socket path is necessary when interacting with Sway from external programs or scripts using Wayland protocols such as XDG_DESKTOP_DATA_GET or DBus.'
        help: '[AI] `sway` is a tiling window manager for Wayland. The `--help` option is used to display detailed help information about the `sway` command. It provides an overview of the available commands and options, as well as brief explanations for each one. This information can be useful for understanding how to use `sway` effectively and troubleshoot any potential issues.'
        validate: '[AI] `sway` is a tiling window manager for Wayland, and `--validate` is an option used with its configuration file editor, `swayctl`. This option checks the syntax of the Sway configuration file for errors before applying any changes. If there are no issues, the system will report "Configuration valid" or "No errors". In case of errors, it will provide detailed messages to help users identify and fix the problems in their configuration files.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `sway` command with the `--verbose` flag is used in the Sway window manager for the Linux desktop environment. This flag increases the level of output and detail provided during the execution of sway-related commands, making it easier to diagnose issues or follow the progress of certain operations. It enables more comprehensive logging and error messages.'
        version: '[AI] The `sway` command with the `--version` argument is used to display information about the Sway window manager''s version number and build details. When executed in a terminal or console, it will output a line containing something like: `Sway init 1.4 (2021-09-13)`. The version number is the most prominent piece of information, indicating the major, minor, and sometimes micro release numbers. The date indicates when the specific build was created.'
