documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `cargo logout` command is used in Rust programming language''s package manager, Cargo. It is used to remove the authentication tokens from your local Cargo configuration file (`.cargo/config`), effectively logging you out of any Crates.io account associated with that configuration. This can be useful if you want to prevent unintended usage or if you need to switch between multiple accounts.'
    flag:
        help: |-
            [AI] `cargo logout` is a command in Cargo, Rust's package manager. This command is used to log out from a registry, such as Crates.io or a private Git repository, where you have previously logged in with `cargo login`. Logging out revokes the access token associated with your login, preventing unauthorized use of your account.

            The `--help` flag provides detailed information about the command and its usage. Here's what it shows:

            ```sh
            USAGE: cargo logout [OPTIONS]

            Logs you out from a registry

            FLAGS:
                --force        Force logging out even if there are still active dependencies
                    that require authentication. Use with caution.

            For more information visit https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/logout.html
            ```

            By default, this command will only log you out of the currently authenticated registry. The `--force` option can be used to log out even if there are still active dependencies that require authentication. Use with caution as it may break your project's build process.
        quiet: '[AI] The `cargo logout` command with the `--quiet` flag is used in Cargo, Rust''s package manager, to log out a user from the Cargo server. By running `cargo logout --quiet`, you will be logged out silently without displaying any confirmation message or progress updates. This can be useful if you want to log out without interactivity or feedback, such as in scripts or automated workflows.'
        registry: '[AI] The `cargo logout` command is used in Rust programming language''s package manager, Cargo, to remove the authentication credentials from the global configuration file or the current project''s Cargo.toml file, thereby logging out the user from a specific Docker registry. This operation revokes access to download and publish packages for that registry, providing enhanced security by preventing unauthorized use of your account.'
