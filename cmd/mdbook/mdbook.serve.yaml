documentation:
    command: '[AI] `mdbook serve` is a command used in the `mdBook` book generation framework for Rust. It starts a local web server to serve and view live previews of Markdown books during development. The output is displayed in the terminal, with the default URL being `http://localhost:3000`. This allows authors to easily preview their changes in real time while editing their content.'
    flag:
        dest-dir: '[AI] `mdbook serve --dest-dir` is a command used in the `mdBook` book generation tool. This command starts a live serving of the MdBook project using the `serve` subcommand. The option `--dest-dir` specifies the target directory where the generated HTML files will be placed and served by the `serve` process. This allows for real-time previewing of changes to the source Markdown files while developing or presenting a book or documentation in a collaborative setting.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `mdbook serve --help` is a command used in the Mdbook documentation generator to start the built-in live book serving feature with options for customization. Here are some key flags and their meanings:

            - `--port PORT`: Sets the HTTP server port number to listen on (default: 3000)
            - `--address ADDRESS`: Sets the IP address to bind to for the server (default: 127.0.0.1)
            - `--watch` or `-w`: Enables file watching for live reloading and updates
            - `--bind BIND`: Specifies a path to bind to when serving books from multiple directories
            - `--theme THEME`: Sets the theme to use for the served book (default: default)

            This command starts an HTTP server locally, allowing you to view your generated Mdbook documentation in real time as you make changes.
        hostname: '[AI] `mdbook serve` is a command used in the Mdbook documentation generator to start a live preview server. The `--hostname` option specifies the network interface or IP address on which the server should listen. By default, it listens on `localhost`, but using `--hostname <IP_ADDRESS>` allows accessing the live preview from other devices on the same network.'
        open: '[AI] `mdbook serve --open` is a command used with the Mdbook book generator in Rust. It builds and serves an Mdbook project using the development server. The `--open` flag automatically opens your default web browser and navigates to the generated book''s URL for live previewing while editing the source files.'
        port: '[AI] `mdbook serve --port` is a command used with Mdbook, a book builder for Markdown files. This specific command starts the Mdbook server and sets it to listen on a specified port number for serving the generated book''s HTML files locally over a web browser or other HTTP clients. For example, `mdbook serve --port 3000` would start the server listening on port 3000, making your book accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.'
        version: '[AI] `mdbook serve --version` is a command used with the MDBook documentation generator. It specifically requests the version information of the MDBook server component that is being run. The output will display the version number of the MDBook server, allowing users to check if they are using an up-to-date version.'
