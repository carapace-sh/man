documentation:
    command: '[AI] `LightDM` is a popular Display Manager for Linux systems, responsible for managing and starting the graphical user interface (GUI) session for users after they log in. It handles authentication, session management, and provides a greeter interface for users to enter their login credentials. LightDM is known for its flexibility, ease of use, and compatibility with various desktop environments.'
    flag:
        cache-dir: '[AI] `lightdm --cache-dir` is a command used in Linux systems with LightDM display manager. It sets or retrieves the path to the cache directory for LightDM. The cache directory stores various data such as session information and user preferences, allowing faster access and reduced load times during login sessions. Setting the cache directory can help manage cache files and improve system performance.'
        config: |-
            [AI] `sudo systemctl edit --quiet --merge-conf=/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/*.conf /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/yourfile.conf` is not exactly the same command as `lightdm --config`, but they are related in that both involve configuring LightDM, a popular display manager for Linux systems.

            The `lightdm --config` command is used to show or modify the default configuration settings of LightDM without editing the actual configuration files. It's important to note that changes made using this command only persist during the current session and will be lost after rebooting the system unless saved to a configuration file.

            The `--config` option displays the current configuration settings in an easy-to-read format. To make permanent changes, use your preferred text editor or the `systemctl edit` command to modify the relevant configuration files under /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/.
        debug: |-
            [AI] `lightdm --debug` is a command used to start the Light Display Manager (LightDM) in debug mode. LightDM is a popular display manager for Linux and Unix-based systems, responsible for managing and starting the graphical user interface (GUI).

            When started with the `--debug` option, LightDM provides more detailed output during its startup process, which can be helpful for troubleshooting issues related to configuration files, system settings, or other potential problems. The debug information is typically printed to the terminal or a log file for further analysis.
        help: '[AI] `lightdm --help` is a command used in Linux systems to display help information about the Light Display Manager (LightDM). LightDM is a popular display manager used for starting and managing graphical user environments. This command, when run with the "--help" option, will show detailed information about how to use LightDM, including available options for configuration, troubleshooting, and other useful features. It''s an essential tool for administrators and users who need to understand or modify the LightDM settings.'
        log-dir: '[AI] `lightdm --log-dir` is a command-line option for the Light Display Manager (LightDM), a popular display manager for Linux systems. This option sets the directory where LightDM logs will be stored. The logs contain information about system events, such as user login attempts and successful logins, as well as any errors or warnings that occur during the LightDM session. By specifying a custom log directory, system administrators can easily manage and monitor these logs for troubleshooting and security purposes.'
        pid-file: '[AI] `lightdm --pid-file` is a command used in Linux systems to start Light Display Manager (LightDM) and save its process identifier (PID) into a specified file for monitoring or identification purposes. This can be useful in system administration tasks, especially when managing multiple display managers or checking the status of running services. The syntax includes specifying the path to the desired pid-file: `lightdm --pid-file=/path/to/file.pid`.'
        run-dir: '[AI] `lightdm --run-dir` is a command used in Linux systems to start a specific display manager session stored in a directory under LightDM''s run directory (usually located at `/var/lib/lightdm/lightdm-<session>.session`). By using this command, you can start a custom or alternative desktop environment or application session managed by LightDM without having to modify the default configuration files. This can be useful for multise sessions or specialized environments within a system.'
        show-config: '[AI] `lightdm --show-config` is a command used in Linux systems to display the configuration file path and other related settings for the Light Display Manager (LightDM). LightDM is a popular display manager used for starting the graphical user interface (GUI) of the system. This command helps users find or check the location and contents of their LightDM configuration files, which can be useful when troubleshooting issues or customizing the display manager settings. By executing this command in a terminal, you''ll see an output containing the path to the main configuration file and additional information on the current active profile (if applicable).'
        test-mode: '[AI] `lightdm --test-mode` is a command used in Linux systems to test the Light Display Manager (LightDM) graphical user interface (GUI) authentication and session handling without starting a full GUI session. It runs LightDM in non-interactive mode, performing checks on various configurations and functionalities such as authentication providers and display manager settings. This is helpful for system administrators to diagnose and troubleshoot issues related to the LightDM environment before deploying it on a production system or making configuration changes.'
        version: '[AI] `lightdm --version` is a command used in Linux systems to check the version information of LightDM, a popular display manager for graphical login interfaces. When executed, it will print out the specific release name and version number of the currently installed LightDM package, along with any accompanying build information if available.'
