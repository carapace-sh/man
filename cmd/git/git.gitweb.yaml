documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "git gitweb" is not a valid Git command. "git" is a popular version control system, and "gitweb" is a separate web interface for Git repositories. To use gitweb, you need to install it separately, typically as a CGI script on a web server or as a standalone application. Once installed, you access the Git repository through a web browser by visiting the URL associated with the gitweb installation and providing the path to your Git repository. So, there is no Git command that directly corresponds to "git gitweb".'
