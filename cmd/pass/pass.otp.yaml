description: extension for managing one-time-password (OTP) tokens
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pass otp` command in Pass (a password manager) generates a one-time password (OTP) for a specific entry. This OTP can be used instead of the master password or regular password for an authenticated session with a service that supports two-factor authentication using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) or Hashed Time-based One-Time Passwords (HOTP). The command retrieves the secret key associated with the entry and uses it to generate the OTP.'
