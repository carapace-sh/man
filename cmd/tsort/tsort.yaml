    command: '[AI] `tsort` is a Unix command used for topological sorting of a directed graph. It reads a list of dependencies between objects from standard input, outputs their order as a list on standard output. The graph represented by the input must be acyclic to ensure a valid output.'

            [AI] `tsort` is a Perl module for topological sorting of directed graphs. The command `tsort --help` displays help information about how to use this module. Here's a brief summary:

            This command shows you how to call the `tsort()` function with different options, and provides examples. The basic usage is as follows:

            ```perl
            @sorted_nodes = tsort { $a <=> $b } %graph;
            ```

            Where `%graph` represents a hash of references to arrays, where each array contains the nodes that depend on a given node.

            The options include specifying custom comparison subroutines, sorting in reverse order, and suppressing warnings. For example:

            ```perl
            @sorted_nodes = tsort { $b <=> $a } %graph, no_warnings => 1;
            ```

            This would perform the topological sort in reverse order while suppressing any warnings that might be generated during the process.
        version: '[AI] `tsort` is a Perl module providing topological sorting of graphs, and the command `tsort --version` is used to display its version information. When executed in a Perl environment, it prints out the name and version number of the installed `tsort` module, along with other relevant details such as the release date and the Perl version required to run it.'
