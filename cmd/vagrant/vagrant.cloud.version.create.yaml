documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud version create` command is used to create a new version of a Vagrantbox, which is a pre-packed and pre-configured VirtualBox or VMware machine image, on the Vagrant Cloud repository. This command takes two arguments: the name of the box and the version number for the new release. Once executed, it generates a GitHub repository with the necessary files to create and publish the new box image, including metadata and configuration files. After pushing these changes to the repository, the box will be automatically built and published on the Vagrant Cloud website for others to use in their projects.'
    flag:
        description: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud version create --description` command is used to create a new version of an existing Vagrantbox image on Vagrant Cloud. The `--description` option sets the description for the new version. When you make changes to your Vagrantbox and want to share it with others, you can use this command to create a new version with the updated description. This helps keep track of different versions of the box and their respective descriptions.'
