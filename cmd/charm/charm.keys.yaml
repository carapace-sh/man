documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "charmap keys" is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It seems to be specific to certain software or tools, possibly related to character maps or input methods. The purpose of this command would depend on the context in which it is used. In general, it might be used to display or manage the keys or characters defined in a character map or input method. For example, in some applications, you can use a character map to enter special characters or symbols that are not on your keyboard. The "charmap keys" command could then be used to view and select those keys or characters.'
    flag:
        randomart: '[AI] The `charms keys --randomart` flag is used in Charms, a snap package manager for Linux, to generate a Random Art image. Random Art is a simple text-based art format used by various command line applications and utilities. The `--randomart` flag requests that Charms generates a Random Art image during the installation or update of a snap package. This image can be displayed in terminal interfaces and console applications, adding some visual appeal to the command line experience.'

The `--simple` option requests that the output of this command be displayed in a simplified format, providing only essential information such as package names and installation states (installed or not). This option is useful when automating scripts or scanning large systems, where excessive details might be unnecessary or distracting.'
