    command: '[AI] `tmux move-window` is a TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) command used to change the position of an attached window pane within the terminal session. It takes arguments in the form of direction keys, such as "up", "down", "left", or "right", indicating the direction to move the selected window pane. The command allows you to rearrange the layout of your TMUX windows and adapt to different workflows efficiently.'
    flag:
        a: '[AI] `tmux move-window -a` is a command in TMUX terminal multiplexer used to swap the adjacent windows horizontally. When you run this command, the current window moves to the left (if from the first position), and the previous window moves to the right, taking its place. This action can be helpful when navigating through multiple windows in a tmux session.'
        b: '[AI] The `tmux move-window` command with the `-b` flag is used to horizontally shift the selected pane or window to the next or previous position in the bar (row) of tmux terminal multiplexer. For example, `move-window -B` will move the selected window one position to the left in the current bar. This command can be useful for quickly navigating between multiple windows within a single tmux session.'
        d: '[AI] `tmux move-window -d` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. It detaches the currently selected window and moves it to the next pane in the same or another TMUX session. By default, it places the detached window in the background. If no window is selected, it selects the active one. The `-d` flag stands for "detach".'
        k: '[AI] `tmux move-window` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. The `-k` option specifies that key presses are used to navigate windows, rather than the default mouse interactions. This command moves the selected window within the Tmux pane layout. When using the `move-window -k` command, you can move windows between panes or splits using arrow keys, for example, or use other modifier keys like `hjkl` to move windows in a cyclic order.'
        r: '[AI] `tmux move-window -r` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer that swaps the positions of two adjacent windows horizontally. The `-r` option specifies that the operation should be done from right to left. This can be useful for rearranging windows within a TMUX session.'
        s: '[AI] `tmux move-window` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer, used to rearrange attached windows. The option `-s` specifies which window to select for the operation. When using `move-window -s`, followed by the target pane number or identifier, you switch the focus of the session to that pane and move the selected window (specified with the `-t` option before `move-window`) to replace it. This command is typically used to move a window between panes or to bring a specific window into view.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux move-window` command with the option `-t` is used to rename or target a window pane in the tmux terminal multiplexer. The `-t` flag followed by a window name or index specifies which window to target for subsequent commands, such as moving or resizing the pane within that window. For example, `tmux move-window -t main_win left` moves the active pane in the "main\_win" window to the left neighboring pane.'
