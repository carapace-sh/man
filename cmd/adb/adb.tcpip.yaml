description: restart adbd listening on TCP on PORT
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `adb tcpip` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to bind a TCP port on the development host to a specific IP address and port number on the Android device. This allows remote connections to the device through ADB over a network, rather than requiring a physical USB connection. The general syntax of the command is `adb shell tcpip <local_port> <remote_IP>:<remote_port>`. For example, `adb shell tcpip 5555 192.168.1.10:5555` binds port 5555 on the device with IP address 192.168.1.10 to port 5555 on the development host. After executing this command, ADB can be accessed over the network using the `adb connect <device_IP>` command, where `<device_IP>` is the IP address of the device.'
