documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker context export` command is used to save a Docker context as a file, allowing you to share or transfer it between different environments or systems. A Docker context represents a set of Docker environments, including the Docker daemon connection, authentication credentials, and other custom settings. When you run this command with the name of a context, it generates a JSON file containing the serialized context data that can be used to recreate the same context on another machine by using `docker context import` command.'
