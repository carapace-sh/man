documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `jj git remote rename` command is a shortcut for renaming an existing Git remote. When you run this command, it opens an editor allowing you to change the name of the remote (the alias before `git remote`) and saves the new name. After saving, Git updates the remote-mapping accordingly.'

        help: |-
            [AI] The `git remote rename` command with the `--help` flag displays help information for renaming a remote repository in Git.

            Here's a brief explanation of the usage and options:

            ```bash
            git remote rename [<old-name>] <new-name>
            ```

            This command renames an existing remote repository with the given old name to the new name. If you don't provide an old name, Git assumes you want to rename the current remote (often named `origin`).

            Options:
            - None in this case, but you can use other Git commands like `--verbose`, `--quiet`, or `--config` with the command if needed.

            Help output: The `--help` flag displays a brief usage message and a more detailed help text, which includes examples and explanations of each option.
