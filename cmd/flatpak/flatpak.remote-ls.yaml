documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flatpak remote-ls` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. This command lists the available remotes, which are repositories or sources from where you can install or update Flatpak applications. The output shows a list of remote names and their URLs.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `flatpak remote-ls --all` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. This command lists all the remotes registered on your system. A remote is a repository or distribution channel from which you can install or update Flatpak applications. The `--all` option displays information for both enabled and disabled remotes.'
        app: '[AI] The `flatpak remote-ls --app` command is used with Flatpak, a software deployment platform, to list applications that are available in a specified remote repository. The `remote-ls` subcommand lists the contents of a Flatpak remote, and the `--app` option filters the output to only display application branches or builds. This command helps developers and users discover and manage the software packages available in a specific repository for deployment with Flatpak.'
        app-runtime: '[AI] The `flatpak remote-ls` command is used to list the applications and their associated runtimes in a Flatpak repository. The `--app-runtime` option filters the output to only show the app runtimes, which are isolated environments containing the necessary libraries and runtime components for a specific application to run. Each line in the output shows an app''s name, its runtime version, and a short SHA-1 checksum identifying the runtime. This command helps users manage their application dependencies and ensures consistency across different systems by allowing them to easily install, update or remove app runtimes.'
        arch: '[AI] The `flatpak remote-ls --arch` command is used with Flatpak, a software deployment platform. This command lists the available architectures (i.e., machine types) in the specified Flatpak remote repositories. Architectures define the hardware and software capabilities of systems where applications packaged using Flatpak can run. By listing the available architectures, system administrators or developers can determine which applications can be installed on their target systems based on their hardware and software configurations.'
        cached: '[AI] The `flatpak remote-ls --cached` command is used in the Flatpak package management system to list the cached files of a remote repository. Flatpak uses remotes to download and install packages from different sources. This command specifically lists the files that are currently stored locally in the cache of the Flatpak system for a specified remote, but not yet installed as part of any specific application or package. The output includes the path, size, and status of each cached file.'
        columns: '[AI] `flatpak remote-ls` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to list available remotes, which are repositories of software packages. The option `--columns` specifies that the output should be displayed as a set of columns, making it easier to read and parse in scripts or spreadsheets. Specifically, this option will display each remote''s name, URL, and active status (true or false) in separate columns.'
        help: '[AI] `flatpak remote-ls` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system. The `--help` option that accompanies it displays detailed information about how to use the `remote-ls` subcommand. In simple terms, `flatpak remote-ls --help` provides help and instructions for listing the remotes (repositories or sources) available in Flatpak. It explains the various options that can be used with this command and their functions, such as displaying the list of remotes in a machine-readable format or filtering the output based on certain criteria.'
        installation: '[AI] The `flatpak remote-ls --installation` command is used with Flatpak, a software deployment platform for Linux systems. This command lists all the installed applications on a system managed by Flatpak, showing their respective versions and branches. It provides information about the installation source (remote) and the installation path of each application. The output can be useful for checking which applications are currently installed via Flatpak, and which version or branch they are running.'
        ostree-verbose: |-
            [AI] `flatpak remote-ls` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system for Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. The `--ostree-verbose` option modifies the output of this command to display detailed information about the OSTree manifests (a data format used by Flatpak to store metadata about packages and their files) in remote repositories.

            In simpler terms, running `flatpak remote-ls --ostree-verbose` lists out the available packages and their respective versions in the specified Flatpak repository, along with additional information such as the SHA1 checksums and commit messages of each manifest version. This level of detail can be useful for verifying the integrity and provenance of package updates before installing them on a system.
        runtime: '[AI] `flatpak remote-ls --runtime` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. This command lists the runtimes available on a specific Flatpak remote, which can be thought of as a repository or distribution channel. A runtime is a collection of libraries and run-time components that Flatpak applications depend upon to execute. By using this command, you can see what runtimes are available for installation from the specified remote.'
        show-details: '[AI] `flatpak remote-ls --show-details` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. This command lists the available remotes (repositories) along with detailed information about each one, such as its URL, GPG key, and whether it''s enabled or disabled. The `--show-details` option provides more extensive output than the standard `remote-ls` command. It helps users manage their Flatpak repositories efficiently by providing clear and comprehensive information.'
        sideloaded: '[AI] `flatpak remote-ls --sideloaded` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager for Linux systems. It lists the Flatpak applications that are locally installed and sideloaded, meaning they were installed directly from a local source rather than from a remote repository. The output of this command displays the application ID, display name, and version number for each sideloaded application.'
        system: '[AI] `flatpak remote-ls --system` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. This command lists the available systems (repositories) on your local machine, specifically those marked as "system" repositories. System repositories contain packages that are approved for deployment across an entire system, such as in enterprise or large-scale environments, and are typically managed by system administrators. The output shows each system repository''s name and the path to its data directory.'
        updates: '[AI] `flatpak remote-ls --updates` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. This command lists the available updates for installed Flatpak remotes. A remote is a repository or source from which you can install or update applications. The `--updates` option displays only the updates that are currently available but not yet applied. It helps system administrators and users keep their systems up-to-date with the latest software versions.'
        user: '[AI] `flatpak remote-ls --user` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux desktop environments. This command lists the remotes that are currently configured for a user''s Flatpak installation. Remotes are repositories or sources from which Flatpak can download and install applications and their dependencies. The `--user` option filters the output to only show remotes specific to the current user, rather than system-wide remotes.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak remote-ls --verbose` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to list the available remotes (repositories) with detailed information. The `--verbose` flag increases the output''s detail level, providing each remote''s full name, URL, and active status.'
