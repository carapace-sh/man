documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `rustup target` command is used in Rust programming language to manage and switch between different target triplets. A target triplet specifies the architecture, OS, and ABI (Application Binary Interface) for which Rust code will be compiled. For example, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` is a common target triplet for 64-bit Windows systems using Microsoft Visual Studio as the compiler. By invoking `rustup target add <target>`, you can add a new target to your Rust toolchain, while `rustup target set <target>` sets the active target. These commands allow developers to build and test their code for various environments, making cross-platform development more convenient.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `rustup target --help` is a Rust command used to display available targets for Rust compilation. Rust has various targets representing different architectures and operating systems. This command shows a list of these targets along with their corresponding triple, which specifies the architecture, OS, and if applicable, ABI. To install or switch between targets, use other Rustup subcommands like `rustup add` or `rustup default`.'
