        image: '[AI] The `swaybg` command is a background manager for the Wayland compositor Sway. The `--image` option specifies that an image file should be used as the wallpaper or background. When you provide a path to an image file with this option, `swaybg` will set that image as your desktop background.'
        mode: |-
            [AI] `swaybg` is a background manager for the tiling window manager Sway. The `--mode` option sets the mode of operation for `swaybg`. There are two modes:

            1. `--mode wallpaper`: This mode sets the specified image as the background for all screens. This is the default mode.
            2. `--mode fullscreen`: In this mode, `swaybg` covers the entire screen with a solid color or gradient instead of displaying an image as a background. This can be useful for presentations or when using Sway in a headless server setup.
        output: '[AI] `swaybg` is a background manager for the Sway window manager in Linux. The `--output` option specifies which output or monitor the wallpaper or background image should be applied to. For example, `swaybg --output DP-1 --image /path/to/image.jpg` sets the background image on the first display connected to your system.'
        version: '[AI] `swaybg` is a background manager for the Wayland compositor Sway. The `--version` option is used to display the current version of swaybg that is installed on your system. When you run the command `swaybg --version`, it will print out the version number, typically in the format "Version: X.Y.Z" or similar, indicating the major, minor, and possibly micro release numbers.'
