documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker image load` is a command used to load an image file stored on your local filesystem into a Docker registry. This command takes one or more tarball files as input, created using the `docker save` command, and pushes them to a specified registry. The image file can be stored locally in a tarball format, such as when you have built an image from source code and want to share it with others. By default, images are loaded into the default Docker registry (Docker Hub), but this can be changed by specifying a different registry URL or using authentication. The syntax is `docker image load [OPTIONS] IMAGE_FILE [IMAGE_FILE...]`.'
    flag:
        input: '[AI] The `docker image load` command is used to load a tarball or a docker file into Docker registry. The `--input` option specifies the path to the local tarball or docker file. This command reads the given file, builds an image from it, and then pushes it to the default registry or specified registry if authenticated. This is typically used when you have a local image that needs to be added to a Docker registry for sharing with other users or teams.'
        quiet: '[AI] `docker image load --quiet` is a command used to load a file containing Docker image data into the local Docker registry. The `--quiet` option suppresses the output of progress indicators and other non-error messages, making it useful for scripting or automation purposes where only the success/failure status is needed.'
