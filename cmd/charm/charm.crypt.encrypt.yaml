        [AI] The `charm crypt encrypt` command is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It appears to be specific to the Charmed Kubernetes distribution from Canonical. This command is used for encrypting data using Charmed Kubernetes' built-in encryption capabilities.

        The exact usage and arguments of this command would depend on the specific implementation in the Charmed Kubernetes environment. It's recommended to refer to the official documentation or consult the Charmed Kubernetes team for more information.
