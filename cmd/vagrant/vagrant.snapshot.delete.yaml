documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant snapshot delete` command is used to remove a previously saved snapshot of a Vagrant virtual machine. When you create a snapshot using `vagrant save`, it captures the current state of your VM, allowing you to revert back to that state later. With `snapshot delete`, you can remove a specific snapshot by its name or ID. This command helps in managing your VMs'' snapshots and allows you to keep only the ones you need.'
