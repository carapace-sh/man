description: Repopulate the working directory with all files, disabling sparse checkouts
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git sparse-checkout disable` is a Git command used to completely unset the sparse checkout configuration in the repository. With this command, Git will no longer filter which files or directories are included in the working directory checkout. This can be useful when you want to revert back to a normal, non-filtered checkout.'
