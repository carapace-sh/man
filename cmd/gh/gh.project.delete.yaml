documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh project delete` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to delete a GitHub Project. This command requires providing the project ID or name as an argument for identification. Once executed, it irreversibly deletes the specified project along with all its associated data such as issues, wiki pages, and other related content. It''s important to note that deleting a project cannot be undone.'
    flag:
        format: '[AI] The `gh project delete --format` command is used in GitHub''s `gh` CLI tool to delete a project and specify the output format for the deletion confirmation message. The `--format` option allows you to customize the output message by using placeholders that will be replaced with actual data. For instance, you can use `%name%` to display the name of the project being deleted. This command sends a request to GitHub API to delete the specified project and returns the deletion confirmation message in the specified format.'
        jq: |-
            [AI] The command `gh project delete --jq` is a combination of two separate GitHub actions.

            1. `gh project delete`: This is a command-line interface tool provided by GitHub to delete a GitHub Project programmatically. It takes no arguments and deletes the currently selected project.

            2. `--jq`: This is an option passed to `gh`, which stands for "JSON query". The `--jq` flag allows you to filter, transform or extract specific data from the output of GitHub API responses using JSON queries written in the `jq` language. In this context, it's not explicitly used with the project delete command, but instead, it is used for further processing of the output if needed. For instance, one could use `gh project delete --jq '.id'` to extract the ID of the deleted project from the response.
        owner: '[AI] The `gh project delete --owner` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to delete a specific project owned by the authenticated user from their GitHub account. This action will permanently remove the project along with all its branches, commits, and other associated data. It''s important to note that this operation can only be performed if the project is yours or if you have sufficient permissions to delete it.'
        template: '[AI] The `gh project delete --template` command is a GitHub CLI (gh) instruction used to delete a project template from GitHub. When you create a new repository using a template, GitHub stores that template as an artifact. This command allows you to remove those templates associated with your account or organization. It does not delete any associated repositories, only the template itself.'
