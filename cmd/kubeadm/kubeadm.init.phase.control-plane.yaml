        [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster with a single-node Control Plane. The `phase control-plane` argument is used to specify that only the Control Plane nodes should be initialized.

        During this phase, `kubeadm` performs several tasks: it sets up the Kubernetes certificate authorities and service account keys, initializes the etcd database, installs Flannel or another network plugin, and configures kubelet and kube-apiserver services. The result is a ready-to-use Control Plane node that can be joined by worker nodes to form a complete Kubernetes cluster.
