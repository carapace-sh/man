    command: '[AI] The `tmux select-window` command in Tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) is used to select a different window amongst the ones attached to the current session. By default, this command selects the next window in the order they were created, but you can specify a window number as an argument to directly select it. With the selected window now in focus, you can send input and perform actions accordingly.'
    flag:
        T: '[AI] The `tmux` command `select-window -T <window_name_or_index>` is used to select a window in the `tmux` terminal multiplexer by its name or index, and sets the window title to the specified `<window_name_or_index>`. This can be useful for quickly identifying and navigating between multiple windows within a single `tmux` session.'
        l: '[AI] The `tmux select-window` command with the option `-l` (lowercase L) in TMUX terminal multiplexer is used to select the window lying to the left of the current one in the same pane. This allows users to easily navigate between windows within a single pane.'
        "n": '[AI] `tmux select-window -n` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. It allows you to switch to the next window in the Tmux session horizontally. The `-n` option means "next" in sequence, so this command will cycle through the windows in order from left to right.'
        p: '[AI] `tmux select-window -p` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that allows you to select the previous window pane in a particular window. The `-p` option causes Tmux to display the name or number of the selected pane or window, providing feedback about which pane has been selected.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux select-window` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. The `-t` option is used to specify the target window by its window title or index. When you run this command followed by the target window identifier, tmux will switch focus to that specific window. For example: `tmux select-window -t 0` would select and focus the first window in the session.'
