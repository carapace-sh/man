        quiet: '[AI] `volta pin --quiet` is a command used in Volta, a global tool for JavaScript projects. The `--quiet` flag is an option that suppresses all output from Volta, making the command run with minimal interference and only display error messages if any occur during the execution of the command related to managing pins (dependencies) in a JavaScript project.'
        verbose: '[AI] `volta pin --verbose` is a command used in Volta, a universal package manager for JavaScript projects. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output displayed during the execution of the `pin` command. This can be helpful for debugging and understanding what actions Volta is taking when it pins or manages dependencies for a project.'
