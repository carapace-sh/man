description: Compile Dart to a JIT snapshot
flags:
    --verbosity=: Sets the verbosity level of the compilation.
    -h, --help: Print this usage information.
    -o, --output=: Write the output to <file name>.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `dart compile jit-snapshot` command is used in Dart programming language to generate just-in-time (JIT) compilation snapshots for specific Dart scripts or libraries. These snapshots are precompiled versions of the code, which can be loaded and executed more quickly than interpreting the source code at runtime. This improves application start-up time and reduces overall execution time, especially for large or complex applications.'
    flag:
        help: |-
            [AI] The `dart compile jit-snapshot` command is a Dart development tool that generates just-in-time (JIT) compiled code snapshots for Dart applications. This flag `--help` is used to display the detailed help information about this specific Dart compiler command, including:

            1. Syntax and usage instructions.
            2. Required and optional arguments.
            3. Description of each option.
            4. Examples of how to use it effectively.
            5. Information about possible errors and their solutions.

            By using `dart compile jit-snapshot --help`, you'll have a clear understanding of what this command does, how to utilize it for your project, and the different options available to customize its behavior.
        output: '[AI] The `dart compile jit-snapshot --output` command is used in Dart programming language to generate just-in-time (JIT) compiled snapshots for specific Dart scripts or libraries. These snapshots can then be loaded by the Dart Virtual Machine (VM) at runtime, which allows for faster execution as the code is precompiled and optimized. The `--output` flag specifies the output file name where the generated JIT snapshot will be saved.'
        verbosity: '[AI] The `dart compile jit-snapshot` command is used to generate just-in-time (JIT) compiled Dart code into a snapshot file. The `--verbosity` option increases the amount of output produced during the compilation process, providing more detailed information about the steps involved in generating the snapshot file. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the compilation process in greater detail.'
