        [AI] `adb wait-for-recovery` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to wait for the device to enter the recovery mode. Recovery mode is a low-level interface on an Android device that allows performing advanced tasks such as flashing custom recoveries or ROMs.

        When you run `adb wait-for-recovery`, ADB will attempt to establish a connection with your Android device and monitor its state for the recovery mode to be activated. Once the recovery mode is detected, ADB returns control back to the terminal, signaling that the device is now in recovery mode and ready for advanced operations.
