documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "tofu" is not a valid command in common computing contexts. It could be a typo or a reference to Tofu, a free and open-source image compression library for lossless and near-lossless compression of RGB images using the Open JPEG (J2K) standard. However, without additional context, it is impossible to determine the specific meaning intended by this command.'
    flag:
        chdir: '[AI] The `tofu` command in Unix-based systems, followed by the `-chdir` option, is used to change the working directory of a running process to a specified directory. In other words, it sets the current directory for the process executing the command to the given directory path. For instance, `tofu -chdir /path/to/directory` would change the working directory to the one located at "/path/to/directory".'
        help: '[AI] The `tofu help` command is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It seems to be specific to Tofu, a tool used in the Rust programming language for secure key management and encryption. The command displays information about available sub-commands and their usage. For example, `tofu help init` shows how to initialize a new Tofu keyring.'
        version: '[AI] The `tofu --version` command is used to check the version information of Tofu, a Kubernetes CLI tool for managing application workloads and clusters. Running this command will display the specific version number of the installed Tofu client in your terminal or command-line interface. This can help ensure that you are using the latest or desired version, and also make it easier to troubleshoot any potential issues by comparing against known working versions.'
