    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm init` command is used to bootstrap a new Kubernetes cluster. When running this command with the argument `phase etcd`, it initializes only the Etcd cluster component. Etcd is the distributed key-value store that holds the current configuration of the cluster and is used as the backing datastore for the Kubernetes API server. In simpler terms, this command sets up the Etcd cluster which is a crucial part of the Kubernetes control plane.'
