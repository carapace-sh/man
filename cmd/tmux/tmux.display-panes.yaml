    command: '[AI] `tmux display-panes` is a TMUX command that allows you to view the layout of all panes in your current TMUX session. It lists the pane indices along with their corresponding window labels. This command helps you keep track of the structure of your TMUX session and can be useful when managing multiple panes or windows.'
    flag:
        "N": '[AI] The `tmux display-panes -N` command in Tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) returns the number of available display panes within the current terminal window. The `-N` flag ensures that only the count is displayed, without activating or showing any specific pane.'
        b: '[AI] The `tmux display-panes -b` command in Tmux is used to display the number of active panes (split windows) in the current session across all the windows horizontally, as a bar at the bottom of the terminal. It does not change the layout of the panes or the content displayed within them. The `-b` flag indicates that the information should be displayed in a horizontal bar format.'
        d: '[AI] The `tmux display-panes -d` command in TMUX is used to detach all session''s displayed panes, sending them to the background. Detaching sessions keeps your terminal sessions running even if you log out of your SSH connection or close your terminal window. This command does not terminate the sessions; instead, it only hides their panes from your current display. The `-d` option ensures that TMUX detaches all displayed panes in all sessions without asking for confirmation.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux display-panes -t` is a Tmux command used to list the number of displayed panes for each pane group in the current session. The option `-t` tells Tmux to display the pane IDs and number of panes as output. This can be useful for understanding the layout and structure of a complex Tmux session.'
