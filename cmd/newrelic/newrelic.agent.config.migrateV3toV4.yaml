    command: '[AI] The `newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4` is a command used in the New Relic Agent, which is a software instrumentation tool for monitoring applications and their performance. This command initiates the migration process from New Relic Agent configuration version 3 to version 4. During this migration, various settings and configurations are updated or adjusted to comply with the latest version''s requirements. It ensures that the agent continues to function effectively while taking advantage of new features and enhancements present in the newer version.'
    flag:
        overwrite: '[AI] The `newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 --overwrite` command is used to migrate New Relic Agent configuration from version 3 to version 4 with the option `--overwrite`. This means that any existing configuration files in version 4 will be replaced by the migration process. This command is useful when you want to ensure a clean start for your configuration setup in version 4, and you don''t mind losing any custom configurations present in version 4. The migration process converts the configuration format from version 3 to version 4, which may include changes to syntax or available features.'
        pathConfiguration: '[AI] The `newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 --pathConfiguration` command is used to migrate New Relic agent configuration from version 3 to version 4, specifically for the "configuration" path. This command is typically run in a terminal or command prompt when managing the New Relic infrastructure agent. The migration process converts the older V3 format configuration files to the newer V4 format, allowing users to take advantage of new features and improvements available in the latest version of the agent.'
        pathDefinition: |-
            [AI] The `newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 --pathDefinition` command is used in the New Relic Agent, which is a software instrumentation tool for monitoring applications and their performance. This command initiates the migration process from version 3 to version 4 of the configuration file format.

            The `--pathDefinition` option specifies the location and structure of the new configuration files, defining the paths to the different sections or components within the configuration. It allows users to customize the organization and layout of their configuration data during the migration process.

            This command is helpful when upgrading the New Relic Agent while maintaining the desired configuration settings and avoiding potential issues caused by incompatibilities between the old and new configuration formats.
        pathOutput: '[AI] The `newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 --pathOutput` command is used to migrate New Relic Agent configuration from version 3 to version 4 with the specified output path. This command interacts with the New Relic Agent, which is a software that provides performance monitoring and other insights for applications. The migration process updates the configuration format from the older version 3 to the newer version 4. The `--pathOutput` option specifies the directory where the migrated configuration files will be saved after the process completes.'
