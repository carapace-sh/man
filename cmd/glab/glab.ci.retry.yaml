description: Retry a CI/CD job
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `glab ci retry` is a GitLab CI/CD command used to retry a failed job or pipeline in GitLab. When a job or pipeline fails, this command can be run to attempt to re-execute the failed task with the same arguments and environment variables as the original job. This can be helpful when encountering transient errors or intermittent build failures. If the issue persists after retrying, it may indicate a deeper problem that requires further investigation.'
