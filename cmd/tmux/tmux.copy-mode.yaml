documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tmux copy-mode` is a TMUX keybinding or command that switches the current terminal pane to a character-editing mode, allowing users to perform actions like copying selected text or editing it before pasting, similar to using `Ctrl+Shift+C` and `Ctrl+Shift+V` in vi/vim. In this mode, the cursor can be used to select text, which is then stored in a buffer for later pasting with `Ctrl+B``"` or `Alt+```. When finished, `Enter`, `Esc`, or other keys can be used to exit copy mode and return to command-line mode.'
    flag:
        s: '[AI] `tmux copy-mode -s` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer that switches the terminal behavior to a mode called "copy mode." In this mode, pressing the mouse button or specific keys allows you to select text and paste it into other windows, panes, or even system clipboards. It''s particularly useful for editing files across multiple terminals without having to manually copy and paste between them.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux copy-mode -t` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to enter the copy mode. Copy mode allows users to select and manipulate text within a pane or window. The `-t` option specifies which target pane or window to send the copied text to. When executed, it sets the mouse cursor to be in a text selection mode, allowing the user to make selections and send them to another pane or window using keyboard shortcuts.'
