    command: '[AI] `tmux if-shell` is a TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) command used to run conditional actions based on the exit status of a shell command. The basic syntax is: `if -s <condition> <command>; then <actions>; fi`, where `<condition>` is the shell command with its output connected to the TMUX condition-status named socket `<socket>`, and `<actions>` are the commands to be executed if the condition evaluates to true. This can be useful in managing terminal sessions, for instance, detaching a session only if a long-running background process completes successfully.'

            [AI] The `tmux` command `if-shell -F` is used to conditionally execute a series of commands based on the exit status of a shell command. The `-F` option allows using a custom format string for the output of the shell command, which can be used in the conditional tests.

            Here's a breakdown of the components:

            * `tmux`: A terminal multiplexer that enables splitting, resizing, and managing terminal windows.
            * `if-shell`: A built-in `tmux` command to run a shell command and perform an action based on its exit status.
            * `-F`: An option to specify a custom format string for the output of the shell command.

            The general syntax is: `tmux if-shell -F "format_string" "command"`

            For example, `tmux if-shell -F "%{#S[${TCPPORT%:*}]}" -t target_window "ssh user@remote_host"` will execute the `ssh` command in a new window (target_window) only if the port number specified in the variable TCPPORT contains a colon character. The exit status of the shell command (whether it found a colon or not) determines which set of commands gets executed.
        b: |-
            [AI] The `tmux` command `if-shell -b` is used to conditionally attach to a new or existing `tmux` session based on an external command's exit status. The `-b` flag means that `tmux` will run the command in the background and only print the output if the exit status is not zero.

            The syntax of the command is:
            ```
            tmux if-shell -R "command" session "[cmd]"
            ```
            Replace `command` with the command to be run, `session` with the name or number of the desired `tmux` session, and `[cmd]` with any optional commands you want `tmux` to execute inside the session upon attachment.

            For example, to conditionally attach to a session named `my-session` if a script named `check_script.sh` exits with a status of zero:
            ```bash
            tmux if-shell -R "sh check_script.sh" my-session
            ```
        t: '[AI] `tmux if-shell -t` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer. It conditionaly sends a shell command to a named window or pane based on certain conditions. The `if-shell` part indicates that the condition will be evaluated as a shell command using the shell specified in the Tmux session. The `-t` option followed by a target window or pane name or number specifies which window or pane the command will be applied to if the condition is met.'
