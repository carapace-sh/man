documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant push` command is used to share a Vagrant project with others by pushing the virtual machine (VM) image to a remote Vagrant Cloud repository. This allows others to easily pull and use the image for their own projects, ensuring consistency across team members or projects. When you run `vagrant push`, Vagrant packages your VM configuration and pushes it to the specified provider and box version on Vagrant Cloud. Users can then access and download the packaged box using its unique URL.'
