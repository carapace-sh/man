documentation:
    command: '[AI] "Flutter" is an open-source mobile application development framework created by Google. It uses a UI toolkit called Skia to render fast and natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. The Flutter command-line interface (CLI) tool enables developers to create, build, test, and deploy these applications using the Dart programming language. Essentially, "flutter" is used to initialize, manage, and interact with a Flutter project.'
    flag:
        device-id: '[AI] The `--device-id` flag in Flutter is used to specify a particular Android or iOS device for testing and debugging purposes during app development. It overrides the default device selection in the IDE and allows running tests, building, or launching apps on a specific connected device instead of using an emulator. The device ID can be obtained from the `adb devices` command in the terminal or from the Xcode Organizer window for iOS devices.'
        help: '[AI] `flutter --help` is a command used in the Flutter framework for displaying help information about various Flutter-related commands, tools, and arguments. When executed, it shows a comprehensive list of all available Flutter commands with brief descriptions and usage examples. This can be useful for new users or those seeking a quick reference. The output is typically displayed in the terminal or command prompt.'
        suppress-analytics: '[AI] `--suppress-analytics` is a command-line argument for Flutter, a mobile app development framework. It suppresses the collection and reporting of analytics data to Google Firebase or any other specified analytics service. This flag can be useful when testing sensitive applications where privacy is a concern or during local development without the need for analytics information.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flutter --verbose` is a command-line option used with the Flutter development tool. When this option is specified, Flutter outputs detailed information about what it''s doing at each stage of the build or execution process. This includes more extensive logging, error messages, and progress updates, providing a deeper level of insight into the underlying processes. It can be helpful for debugging complex issues or gaining a better understanding of how Flutter works behind the scenes.'
        version: '[AI] `flutter --version` is a command used in the Flutter framework to check and display the currently installed Flutter and Dart version. It provides essential information for developers working on Flutter projects, ensuring they use compatible versions for their project requirements.'
