    command: '[AI] The "adb remount" command is used with Android Debug Bridge (ADB), a versatile tool that allows communication between an Android device and a computer. This command specifically requests to re-mount an attached Android device''s file system, usually in read-write mode after it was previously mounted in a different mode, like read-only. By executing "adb remount", you grant temporary root access for modifications on the device, allowing tasks such as installing apps or modifying system files.'
    flag:
        R: '[AI] `adb remount -R` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB), a versatile tool that allows developers to communicate with an Android device. This specific command changes the mount point of all partitions on the connected Android device from read-only to read-write mode, making it easier to modify files and make system changes. The `-R` flag stands for "recursive," meaning that this command applies to the entire file system, not just a single directory or partition.'
