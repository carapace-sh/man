documentation:
    command: '[AI] `terraform workspace` is a Terraform command used to manage multiple working directories or "workspaces" in a single Terraform configuration. It allows you to save, list, and select different sets of variables for your resources, making it easier to manage multi-environment deployments (e.g., development, staging, production) from the same configuration files. This command is essential when working with infrastructure that requires multiple environments or configurations.'
