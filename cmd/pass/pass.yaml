    command: |-
        [AI] The "pass" command is a utility used in OpenBSD and some other Unix-like systems for managing encryption keys and passwords. It's primarily used to manage the keyring database, which stores encrypted passwords for various services like SSH or WiFi networks.

        When you use the pass command, it can perform tasks such as creating, listing, adding, updating, or deleting password entries in your keyring database using an encrypted format for enhanced security. It's designed to help users avoid having to remember multiple complex passwords while maintaining strong security practices.
