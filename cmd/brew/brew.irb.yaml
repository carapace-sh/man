documentation:
    command: '[AI] `brew irb` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command specifically runs the IRB (Interactive Ruby) shell within the terminal after ensuring that Ruby is installed and updated through Homebrew. By using Homebrew to manage Ruby and running this command, users can easily access the IRB environment for developing and testing Ruby code interactively.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] The command `brew install irb --debug` is used to install the Interactive Ruby (IRB) shell with debugging enabled in Brew, a popular package manager for macOS. When you add the `--debug` flag, Brew will provide more detailed output during the installation process, making it easier to diagnose any potential issues that may arise. This can be helpful when troubleshooting or when wanting a clearer understanding of what''s happening behind the scenes during the installation process.'
        examples: '[AI] The command `brew install irruby` installs Irruby, a Ruby interpreter that runs in an interactive REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) mode similar to IRB but with added features, using Homebrew on macOS or Linux. The command `brew irb --examples` opens the Irruby REPL with example Ruby scripts preloaded for users to explore and learn from.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `brew irb --help` command is used in the context of Homebrew, a package manager for macOS and Linux. The `irb` here refers to the Interactive Ruby shell, a tool that provides an environment for executing and experimenting with Ruby code.

            The `--help` flag is added to display detailed information about how to use the `irb` command with Homebrew. It provides instructions on how to install or remove the IRB package, along with available options and examples of usage.
        pry: '[AI] The command `brew irb --pry` is used in the context of the Homebrew package manager for macOS or Linux. It installs and launches Interactive Ruby (IRB) with the Pry REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) library as its default output framework, providing a more feature-rich and interactive console experience for developing Ruby code.'
        quiet: '[AI] The command `brew install irb` is used to install the Interactive Ruby shell (IRB) using Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux. The option `--quiet` or `-q` is added to this command to suppress the output of informational messages during the installation process. So, the command `brew install irb --quiet` will quietly install IRB without displaying progress bars or other messages.'
        verbose: '[AI] The command `brew irb --verbose` is used in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS, to run the IRB (Interactive Ruby) console with verbose output. When executed, Homebrew first installs or updates IRB if needed. Then it launches IRB with increased output detail, providing more information about the process and any potential issues encountered during execution.'
