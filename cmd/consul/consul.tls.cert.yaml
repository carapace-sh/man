        [AI] The `consul tls cert` command is used in Hashicorp's Consul service to manage TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates. Specifically, it generates and manages new or renews existing TLS certificates for Consul servers and clients. These certificates are essential for securing communications between Consul components using HTTPS.

        When you run `consul tls cert`, it initiates the certificate generation process by creating a private key and a self-signed certificate for development use or renews an existing certificate if one is already configured. You can specify additional options such as validity period, subject name, etc., depending on your requirements. The generated keys and certificates are stored in the Consul configuration directory for later use.
