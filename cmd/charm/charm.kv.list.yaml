name: list [@DB]
description: List all key value pairs with an optional @ db.
flags:
    -b, --show-binary: print binary values
    -d, --delimiter=: delimiter to separate keys and values
    -k, --keys-only: only print keys and don't fetch values from the db
    -r, --reverse: list in reverse lexicographic order
    -v, --values-only: only print values
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `charms` command with the `kv list` subcommand is used in Charmed Kubernetes deployments to list key-value pairs stored in a Kubernetes ConfigMap or Secret resource managed by Juju''s charm helper, `charm-helper`. This command helps users to view the contents of the configuration data associated with their deployed charms.'
    flag:
        delimiter: '[AI] The `charms kv list --delimiter` command is a part of the Charm operator framework in Canonical''s Juju deployment model. This command lists the key-value pairs stored in a specific Charm''s local state store, with each key-value pair being separated by a specified delimiter character (--delimiter option). It helps in easily parsing and processing the output for further use in scripts or other applications.'
        keys-only: '[AI] `charms-tools`''s `kv list` command with the `--keys-only` option is used to list the keys of a specific Charmed Kubernetes application''s state stored in etcd. The output displays only the key names, providing a clear and concise view of the configuration data managed by the charm. This can be helpful for understanding which configuration parameters are being set and managed by the charm.'
        reverse: |-
            [AI] `charms` is a tool used in Charmed Kubernetes, a Canonical project for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters easily. The command `kv list --reverse` is used with the `juju-storage` charm, which provides an etcd key-value store for the cluster.

            This command lists all keys and values stored in the etcd cluster, but displays them in reverse order (newest first), which can be useful when working with dynamic data or when you want to see the latest changes first. The `--reverse` flag is what achieves this sorting behavior.
        show-binary: '[AI] `charms` is a tool used in Charms, a modeling and composition framework for cloud applications in OpenStack. The command `kv list --show-binary` retrieves key-value pairs as binary data from the specified charm. This option is useful when dealing with large or complex data, as binary data can be more compact and efficient to store and transfer compared to textual data.'
        values-only: '[AI] `charms` is a tool in Charms, Canonical''s open source configuration management system for OpenStack and other applications on Ubuntu. The command `kv list --values-only` is used to list the key-value pairs stored in a Charm''s config file in a raw format, displaying only the values without the keys or any additional formatting.'
