    command: '[AI] The `waypoint server bootstrap` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool to initialize and set up a new Waypoint server instance. It creates a new directory with the necessary files for the server, including a configuration file and an SSH key for secure communication between clients and the server. Additionally, it sets up any required dependencies and configures the server to listen on a specified port.'
    flag:
        app: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint server bootstrap --app` command is used in Hashicorp's Waypoint configuration management tool to initialize a new application deployment environment. Here's a brief explanation of its functionality:

            1. `waypoint`: This is the command-line interface for Waypoint, which lets you manage and configure your applications and infrastructure as code.
            2. `server bootstrap`: The `bootstrap` subcommand sets up an initial configuration for a new environment in Waypoint. In this case, it's setting up a new application environment.
            3. `--app`: This option specifies the name or path of the application you want to configure and deploy using Waypoint. It tells Waypoint which application-specific configuration files (e.g., HCL files) to use for the deployment.
        context-create: '[AI] The command `waypoint server bootstrap --context-create` is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool to create a new execution context. This command sets up a new environment for managing infrastructure and applications, allowing users to define and apply configurations in a modular and secure manner. When run with this option, Waypoint generates the necessary files and directories for a new context, including an `input.yml` file where users can define their resource configurations. This command does not deploy or apply any changes, but rather prepares a foundation for managing specific environments or projects.'
        context-set-default: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint server bootstrap --context-set-default` command is used to initialize a Waypoint server and set a specific context as the default one. Waypoint is an open-source tool for managing and deploying application configurations across various environments.

            When you run this command, Waypoint will create a new server instance, install it, and configure it to use the specified context as the default. This means that when you run `waypoint apply` without specifying a context, the commands will be executed in the context set as default during initialization.

            In summary, this command sets up a Waypoint server with a default context, streamlining the deployment process for your applications within that context.
        plain: '[AI] `waypoint server bootstrap --plain` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool. This command initializes a new Waypoint server using the default configurations, without any interactive prompts or advanced features. The `--plain` flag indicates that the initialization process should be simple and straightforward, with minimal user input. It generates a plain text config file that can be further customized if needed.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint server bootstrap --project` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool to initialize a new project with Waypoint. This command creates the necessary infrastructure and configurations for managing resources using Waypoint. It sets up a new server instance, configures it for your target cloud provider, and generates the initial `waypoint.hcl` file for defining your application stacks, services, and resources in the project directory.'
        server-addr: '[AI] The `waypoint server bootstrap --server-addr` command is used to initialize a new Waypoint (a Hashicorp tool for managing multicloud deployments) server with a specific IP address or domain name (specified by the `--server-addr` argument). This command sets up the initial configuration and dependencies required to run Waypoint as a server, allowing it to manage and deploy applications across multiple cloud providers.'
        server-tls: |-
            [AI] The command `waypoint server bootstrap --server-tls` is used in Hashicorp's Waypoint infrastructure automation tool to set up a new Waypoint server with Transport Layer Security (TLS) enabled for secure communication between clients and the server.

            When you run this command, Waypoint will download and install the necessary components, configure them with TLS certificates and keys, and start the server with TLS support enabled by default. This helps ensure that communications between your infrastructure and your Waypoint server are encrypted and secure.
        server-tls-skip-verify: '[AI] The `waypoint server bootstrap --server-tls-skip-verify` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool. This option disables SSL certificate verification during the creation or update of a Waypoint server. It is essentially telling Waypoint to trust any SSL certificate presented by the server without checking its validity, which can pose a security risk if used with an untrusted server. It is recommended to use this flag only for testing or in trusted environments, and to enable SSL certificate verification when deploying to production systems.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint server bootstrap --workspace` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool. It initializes a new Waypoint workspace, which is a collection of resources that can be managed using Waypoint. This command sets up the necessary infrastructure for managing these resources and configures Waypoint to interact with them. The `--workspace` flag specifies the name or path of the new workspace to be created.'
