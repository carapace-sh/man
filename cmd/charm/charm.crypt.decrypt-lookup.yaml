description: Decrypt arg deterministically
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `crypt` utility in Linux is used for managing Unix-style encrypted password files. The specific command `decrypt-lookup` is not a standard command under this utility but rather an extension provided by some distributions for decrypting individual entries from an encrypted password file (also known as shadow file) using their crypt(3) salted hash values. This can be useful when performing password resets or similar tasks requiring access to specific account information without the need to decrypt the entire file. The command syntax typically looks like this: `crypt --decrypt-lookup hashed_password < /path/to/encrypted/file`. Here, `hashed_password` represents the salted hash value of the password entry you wish to access. Note that performing such operations requires root privileges due to security reasons.'
