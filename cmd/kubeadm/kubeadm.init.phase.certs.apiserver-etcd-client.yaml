name: apiserver-etcd-client
description: Generate the certificate the apiserver uses to access etcd
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save and store the certificates.
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubernetes-version=: Choose a specific Kubernetes version for the control plane.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm init` command with the argument `phase certs apiserver-etcd-client` triggers the generation and configuration of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates for the Kubernetes API server and ETCD client communication. These certificates are essential for securing the communication between these components in a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between them.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool for initializing a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm. The `phase certs apiserver-etcd-client --cert-dir` option specifies that this command phase will generate and place the necessary SSL certificates and keys for securing the communication between the Kubernetes Apiserver and Etcd client component. The `--cert-dir` argument indicates the directory where these files should be saved.'
        config: |-
            [AI] The command `kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client --config` is used to generate and configure the TLS certificates for the Kubernetes API server and etcd client in Kubernetes cluster setup using kubeadm tool.

            The `phase certs` specifies that this command is part of the "certificate generation phase" during which certificates are created. The `apiserver-etcd-client` argument indicates that the certificates generated will be used for both API server and etcd client communication. The `--config` flag indicates that the configuration files for kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl should be written to the specified directory.
        kubernetes-version: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool for bootstrapping a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase certs apiserver-etcd-client` argument specifies the phase of the initialization process to run, which is related to creating and managing certificates for various components.

            More specifically, this flag generates and configures the TLS certificates for the Kubernetes API server and etcd client communication. These certificates are essential for securing the cluster's communication channels and maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity between the API server and etcd.

            In summary, this command initializes a Kubernetes cluster in the specified phase, focusing on generating the necessary TLS certificates for the secure communication between the API server and etcd client.
