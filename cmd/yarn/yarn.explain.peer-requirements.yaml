description: Explain a set of peer requirements
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `yarn explain peer-requirements` is a command used with Yarn, a popular JavaScript package manager. This command displays information about the peer dependencies of installed packages in your project. Peer dependencies are packages that your project depends on, but they are not direct dependencies of any other packages in your project. In other words, they have an equal relationship with your project and other dependencies. Understanding the peer dependencies can be important for managing the compatibility and versioning of your project''s dependencies.'
