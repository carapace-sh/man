description: Lock down dependency versions for publication
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm shrinkwrap` command is used to generate a `shrinkwrap.json` file in an npm project. This file records exact versions of all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file, ensuring consistent dependency versions across different machines and build environments. When you run `npm install`, it will reference the `shrinkwrap.json` file instead of `package.json` to install the specified dependency versions. This can be useful for maintaining consistency and reducing the risk of compatibility issues when collaborating on a project or deploying to production.'
