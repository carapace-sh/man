    command: '[AI] `npm hook` refers to custom scripts defined in an `npm` project''s `package.json` file using the key `"scripts"` or `"hooks"`. These hooks are executed at specific points during the `npm install` or `npm test` lifecycle, allowing for additional customization and automation of development workflows. For instance, a common use case is an `install` hook that runs additional setup tasks after dependencies have been installed.'
