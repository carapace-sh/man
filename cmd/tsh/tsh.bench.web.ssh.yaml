    command: '[AI] The `tsh bench web ssh` command is used in Turbostat, a performance analysis tool for TensorFlow models. This specific command initiates a benchmarking process for measuring the time taken to execute an SSH (Secure Shell) connection from a web interface. It evaluates the network latency and the overhead of establishing an SSH session, providing valuable information for diagnosing potential performance bottlenecks related to remote access in TensorFlow workloads.'
    flag:
        no-random: |-
            [AI] The `tsh bench web ssh --no-random` command is used with the Tiny SSH (tSh) tool, which is a lightweight alternative to OpenSSH for benchmarking and testing SSH connections.

            The specific command:

            1. `bench`: This tells tSh to run a benchmark test on an SSH connection.
            2. `web`: It specifies that the benchmark should be performed over a web socket connection instead of a standard TCP socket.
            3. `ssh`: This is the protocol being used for the benchmark, which is Secure Shell (SSH).
            4. `--no-random`: This option disables the use of random data during the benchmark test. In other words, it performs the test using a predefined set of data instead of generating random data on each iteration. This can help ensure consistent results when comparing test runs.
        port: '[AI] The command `tsh bench web ssh --port` is using the Tsusho Shake (Tsh) tool for benchmarking the performance of SSH connections over HTTP(S). The `bench` subcommand runs a benchmark test, `web` specifies to use HTTP(S) as the transport layer, and `ssh` indicates that the tested connection is an SSH session. The option `--port` follows this, specifying the target port number for the SSH server.'
        random: |-
            [AI] The command `tsh bench web ssh --random` is a part of the Tsung loading tool, which is used to generate and send HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH traffic in order to test the performance of web applications or servers.

            In this specific command:

            - `tsh` refers to Tsung itself.
            - `bench` is the mode that runs a single test scenario repeatedly, measuring statistics.
            - `web` specifies that this test will concern HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
            - `ssh` indicates that some part of the test involves SSH sessions (secure shell).
            - `--random` generates random clients and requests to simulate real-life usage patterns.
