    command: '[AI] The `gh workflow list` command is used with the GitHub CLI (gh) to list all the workflows for a specific repository. It takes the repository URL as an argument and returns the name, ID, and status of each workflow file in that repository. This can be helpful for getting an overview of the continuous integration and delivery pipelines set up for a project.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `gh workflow list --all` is a GitHub CI/CD command that lists all the workflows configured in a repository. The `--all` option shows both enabled and disabled workflows, providing a comprehensive view of the current workflow configuration. This command can help users manage and monitor their continuous integration and delivery pipelines effectively.'
        jq: '[AI] `gh` is a GitHub CLI tool, and the command `gh workflow list --jq` lists all the available workflows in a repository as JSON data. The `--jq` option passes the output to the `jq` query language for filtering and transforming JSON data. In summary, this command retrieves workflow information in JSON format, which can be further processed using `jq`.'
        json: '[AI] `gh workflow list --json` is a command from GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, called `gh`. This command is used to retrieve information about all available workflows in a repository in JSON format. Workflows are automated processes defined in `.github/workflows` files that can be set up in a GitHub repository to perform various tasks like continuous integration, deployment, or release management. The output of this command will be a JSON object containing an array of workflow objects, each with properties such as name, on, and branches, providing details about the configured workflows.'
        limit: '[AI] `gh workflow list --limit` is a GitHub CI/CD command used to list all available workflows in a repository, with the option to limit the number of workflows displayed. The `--limit` argument sets the maximum number of workflows to be returned in the output. For instance, `gh workflow list --limit 5` would display only the first five workflows in the repository.'
        template: '[AI] `gh workflow list --template` is a command used with GitHub''s gh CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. It lists all workflows in your current repository, and applies a given template to the output. This means you can customize the display of the output using mustache templates. The `--template` option takes a path to the template file, which should contain the desired format specifiers for the data fields you''re interested in.'
