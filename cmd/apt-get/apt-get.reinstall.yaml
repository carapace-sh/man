documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `apt-get reinstall` command is used with the APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) package manager in Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions. This command fully upgrades and then reinstalls the specified package and all its dependencies, effectively replacing the current version with a fresh installation from the repositories. In other words, it forces an update and reinstallation of the package to resolve any potential dependency issues or corrupted files.'
