description: Decrypt stdin with your Charm account encryption key
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `charm crypt decrypt` command is not a standard Linux or Unix command, and it seems to be specific to a proprietary encryption tool called Charmshell Crypt. This command is used for decryption with this tool. When you provide the encrypted data and the necessary key or password, the tool will decrypt and output the plaintext data. The exact usage may vary depending on the implementation of the Charmshell Crypt tool.'
