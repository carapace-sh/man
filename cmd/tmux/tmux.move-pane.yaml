    command: |-
        [AI] `tmux move-pane` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer used to horizontally or vertically shift the selected pane within a TMUX window. The basic syntax for this command is:

        - To horizontally shift the selected pane by one position to the left: `tmux move-pane -L`
        - To horizontally shift the selected pane by one position to the right: `tmux move-pane -R`
        - To vertically shift the selected pane up: `tmux move-pane -U`
        - To vertically shift the selected pane down: `tmux move-pane -D`

        These commands will move other panes accordingly to fill the space left or right of, or above or below, the moved pane.
    flag:
        b: '[AI] The `tmux move-pane` command with the `-b` option in TMUX is used to swap the positions of two adjacent panes in a TMUX terminal session horizontally (for vertical swapping use `-t` instead). This can be helpful when you want to switch focus between panes quickly. When used without specifying pane indices, it will swap the left and right adjacent panes by default.'
        d: '[AI] The `tmux move-pane` command with the option `-d` is used to detach and delete a pane in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. When you run this command, TMUX will detach the selected pane (or panes) from the current session and delete them permanently. This means that the data in those panes will be lost. The option `-d` stands for "detach only," meaning that the selected panes are only detached from the session and not deleted until you explicitly issue a `kill-pane` command.'
        f: '[AI] `tmux move-pane -f` is a command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, used to move a pane within a TMUX window in a forceful way. The "-f" option forces the pane to be moved even if it would overlap with other panes, breaking their layout. The direction of the movement depends on additional arguments provided to the command. For example, `tmux move-pane -f -L` moves the selected pane one cell to the left, while `tmux move-pane -f -U` moves it upwards by one row.'
        h: '[AI] The `tmux move-pane` command with the `-h` option is used within the TMUX terminal multiplexer to horizontally shift the selected pane to the left. This allows users to easily switch focus between panes in a multi-pane session, improving productivity by managing multiple tasks or processes simultaneously.'
        l: '[AI] `tmux move-pane -l` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer for Linux and Unix systems. It horizontally shifts the selected pane to the left, merging any empty adjacent panes. This allows users to rearrange their panes within a single TMUX window.'
        s: '[AI] The `tmux move-pane` command with the `-s` option in Tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) is used to swap the positions of two adjacent panes horizontally or vertically within a single window. This can be helpful when you want to switch focus between panes, allowing you to easily compare or work on multiple tasks at once in your terminal sessions.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux move-pane` is a command in TMUX terminal multiplexer used to move panes within a TMUX window. The option `-t` specifies the target pane for the movement. So, the `tmux move-pane -t` command is used to move the current pane to the targeted pane position.'
        v: '[AI] The `tmux move-pane -v` is a command in TMUX terminal multiplexer for vertical pane movement. It moves the selected pane down one position, merging any smaller panes above it into a single larger pane. If no pane is currently selected, the command will select and move the lowermost pane. This command allows users to manage their TMUX sessions with multiple panes, facilitating multitasking in terminal-based workflows.'
