documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `systemctl` command with the `exit` argument is used to gracefully stop a systemd managed service, without terminating the process immediately. This allows the service to finish any current tasks and perform clean shutdown procedures before the system considers it stopped. It''s important to note that this command does not actually exist as a separate systemctl command. Instead, you can achieve the same result by using `systemctl stop` followed by `systemctl isolate`, or just use the `systemctl stop` command with the appropriate options depending on your needs.'
