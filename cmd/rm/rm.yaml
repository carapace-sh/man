documentation:
    command: '[AI] `rm` is a command in Unix and Linux systems used for removing files or directories. The basic syntax is `rm <file>`. To remove a directory, use `rm -r <directory>`. Without options, this command will only remove empty directories or files that exist in the current directory. It''s important to exercise caution when using `rm`, as deleted files cannot be recovered without additional tools or methods.'
    flag:
        I: '[AI] The `rm` command with the `-I` option is a feature in Unix-based operating systems for interactively removing files or directories. When you run `rm -I`, it will display a confirmation message before deleting each file or directory, allowing you to confirm the action before it''s performed. This can be useful for preventing accidental deletion of important data.'
        R: '[AI] The `rm` command with the option `-R` or `--recursive` is used in Unix-based operating systems for deleting directories and their contents recursively. When you use this command, it removes the specified directory along with all of its subdirectories, files, and their contents. It is a powerful command that requires caution while using to avoid unintended deletion of important data.'
        dir: |-
            [AI] The `rm --dir` command is a option used with the `rm` (remove) utility in Unix-like operating systems. It tells `rm` to remove empty directories and their contents recursively, without prompting for confirmation.

            For example: `rm -r directory_name/ --empty-directories`. The `-r` option enables recursive removal of files and directories within the specified directory, while `--empty-directories` specifically removes empty directories during this process.

            It's important to note that using `--dir` without caution can lead to accidental deletion of necessary directories and their contents. Always double check before executing such a command.
        force: '[AI] `rm --force` is a command in Unix-based operating systems used to remove files or directories. The `--force` option (also written as `-f`) tells the `rm` command to delete files or directories without asking for confirmation. It also allows the removal of read-only files and directories, empty directories with the `-p` option, and hidden files starting with a dot (`.`) when the `.` is not explicitly mentioned in the argument list. The use of `rm --force` should be used with caution to avoid accidental deletion of important data.'
        help: '[AI] `rm --help` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems, specifically the `rm` (remove) utility. The `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use the `rm` command, including available options and their functions, and usage examples. It is meant for users who want to understand the capabilities of the `rm` command before using it to delete files or directories.'
        i: '[AI] The `rm -i` command is a Unix/Linux file deletion command with the interactive flag. It will remove files or directories but prompts for confirmation before executing each action, helping prevent accidental deletions.'
        interactive: '[AI] `rm --interactive` is a command in Unix-based operating systems used for deleting files and directories. The `--interactive` option adds a confirmation step before executing each file deletion, asking the user to verify the action with a prompt. This helps prevent accidental deletions. When you run `rm --interactive <file>`, it will display a message like "Delete file ''<file>''? (y/n)" before performing the deletion.'
        no-preserve-root: '[AI] The `rm --no-preserve-root` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems, specifically the `rm` (remove) command with the `--no-preserve-root` option. This flag modifies the behavior of `rm` so that it removes files and directories recursively from the current directory and below, without respecting symbolic links or other file hierarchies rooted at a different location. In other words, it allows the user to forcefully remove files and directories regardless of their position in the file system hierarchy. However, be cautious when using this flag as it can lead to unintended consequences if used incorrectly, such as accidental deletion of important files or directories.'
        one-file-system: '[AI] The `rm --one-file-system` command is a option used with the `rm` utility in Unix-like operating systems. This option ensures that only files from a single file system are deleted during a recursive removal operation, preventing accidental deletion of files across multiple mounted file systems. It helps maintain data integrity and reduces potential errors.'
        preserve-root: '[AI] The `rm --preserve-root` flag is a option for the `rm` command in Unix-like operating systems, which is used to remove files or directories. With the `--preserve-root` option, `rm` will not change the current working directory while performing the file deletion operations, even if those files are located in other directories. This can be useful to prevent accidental deletion of important files or directories by ensuring that you''re always deleting files from the intended location.'
        recursive: '[AI] The command `rm --recursive` is a Unix utility used for removing files and directories. The `--recursive` or `-r` option enables the removal of directories and their contents recursively. This means that when you delete a directory with this option, all the files and subdirectories within it will also be deleted. Be careful as this operation cannot be undone easily without using additional tools or recovering from backups.'
        verbose: '[AI] `rm --verbose` is a command in Unix-based operating systems used to remove files or directories. The `--verbose` option makes the command output detailed information about each file or directory being deleted, including the name of the item and the action being taken (e.g., `removing ''/path/to/file''`). This option is useful for confirming actions and gaining insight into the deletion process.'
        version: '[AI] `rm --version` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems to display the version information of the ''rm'' utility, which stands for "remove" or "delete" files or directories. When entered in the terminal or command line interface, this command returns the name and version number of the rm implementation installed on the system. It helps users ensure they are using an updated version or troubleshoot any potential issues related to the ''rm'' utility.'
