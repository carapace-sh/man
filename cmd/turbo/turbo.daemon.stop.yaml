documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `turbo daemon stop` command is used to terminate the Turbo Daemon process. This daemon, which may be running on various operating systems, manages various background tasks and services. By issuing this command, you are instructing the system to gracefully shut down the Turbo Daemon, stopping it from processing any new tasks while allowing it to finish handling any current ones before terminating completely. This ensures an orderly shutdown that minimizes potential disruptions or data loss.'
