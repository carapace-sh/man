documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `paste` command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems is used to merge files line by line. It takes two or more files as input, and outputs the specified columns from each file, aligned on corresponding rows. For example, given two files with one column each, the command `paste file1 file2` will print the contents of the first column in `file1` followed by the corresponding column in `file2`. The default delimiter is a tab character.'
    flag:
        delimiters: '[AI] `paste` is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems for combining lines of text from files into columns, separated by a specified delimiter. The `--delimiters` option specifies a list of characters used as the column separators. For instance, `paste -d ''\t'' file1 file2` combines the contents of files `file1` and `file2` with tab characters as the delimiter between columns.'
        help: '[AI] `paste --help` is a command in Unix-like operating systems that merges two or more files line by line into one file. The basic usage is `paste file1 file2 > output.txt`, where `file1` and `file2` are input files, and `output.txt` is the name of the resulting merged file. Options can be used to control how lines from different files are aligned (e.g., `--delimiters=ds` sets custom delimiters ds between columns). Other options include `--help` to display help information about the command, and `--version` to check for the version of the installed paste utility.'
        serial: |-
            [AI] `paste --serial` is a command in GNU Core Utilities used to combine files line by line. The `--serial` option ensures that the output is produced one line at a time instead of in parallel, which can be useful when dealing with large data sets or when working interactively in a terminal.

            For instance, consider you have two files named `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, each containing one column of data. To combine them using `paste --serial`, run the following command:

            ```bash
            paste --serial < file1.txt < file2.txt
            ```

            This will print the contents of each line from `file1.txt` followed by the corresponding line from `file2.txt`. Since `--serial` is used, it will output one line at a time, making it easier to process in real-time or when working interactively in a terminal.
        version: |-
            [AI] `paste --version` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems, specifically in the GNU Core Utilities package. This command's primary function is to take multiple files and merge their contents into a single output where each line from one file corresponds with the lines in the other files.

            The `--version` option is used to display information about the installed version of the paste utility, including its name, version number, and sometimes the compilation date. This can be helpful for checking which version of the tool is currently being used on your system and for troubleshooting potential compatibility issues with other software.
        zero-terminated: '[AI] `paste` is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems for combining lines of text from multiple files into columns. The `--zero-terminated` option is used when the input files contain data with zero separators instead of newlines between records. With this option, `paste` reads each line from the files as a single record, separated by zeros instead of newlines, and then combines the corresponding columns into output lines.'
