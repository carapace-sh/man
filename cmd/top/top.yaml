documentation:
    command: '[AI] `top` is a Linux command used to display system processes in real-time, ordered by their current resource consumption. It allows users to interactively observe and manage system processes based on CPU usage, memory usage, or other metrics. Users can sort processes, view detailed information about them, and even terminate selected processes. It''s commonly used for troubleshooting performance issues or identifying resource-intensive processes.'
    flag:
        "1": '[AI] The `top` command with the option `-1` in Unix or Linux displays the top processing task only. It provides real-time information about the running system''s most CPU-intensive process, including its PID (Process ID), percentage of CPU usage, memory usage, and more. This output is useful for quickly identifying and addressing processes that are consuming excessive system resources.'
        E: '[AI] The `top` command with the option `-E` is used to modify the display of the `top` utility in Unix or Linux systems. It enables advanced features such as sorting columns based on user-defined expressions, displaying additional columns, and customizing the output format. With this flag, system administrators and users can gain more detailed and specific insights into the system''s resource usage and performance.'
        H: '[AI] The `top` command with the option `-H` or `--header` is used to display or modify the table headers in the output. With this option, you can customize the column names and their order to suit your specific needs, making it easier to analyze system resource usage data.'
        O: '[AI] The `-o` option in the `top` Linux command is used to modify the display output. Specifically, it allows users to customize which columns or statistics are shown in the output. By default, `top` displays a list of running processes with various metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and process state. However, by using different `-o` options, users can change what data is displayed. For example, `-o %MEM,%CPU` will sort the processes by their memory and CPU usage respectively. The `top` command is a powerful tool for monitoring system performance in real time, and the `-o` option provides flexibility to tailor the display to specific needs.'
        S: '[AI] The `top` command with the `-S` option is used to display the system process status in a continuous interactive mode. This means that the output will be updated in real time as processes change state, providing a live view of the current system processing situation. It is frequently used for monitoring system performance and identifying resource-intensive processes.'
        U: '[AI] The `top` command with the option `-u` (or `--user`) in Unix or Linux systems is used to display the system process information sorted based on the processor utilization of individual processes for a specified user. When run without any arguments, `top` displays the system-wide process list; but when followed by a user name with the `-u` option, it shows the processes belonging only to that particular user. This helps in understanding the resource usage pattern for specific users on a multitasking system.'
        b: '[AI] The `top` command with the `-b` option is used to display the Linux process hierarchy in real-time, repeatedly showing the current running processes sorted by their priority or CPU usage. It operates in the background after being called, allowing other commands to run concurrently and providing continuous updates on system resource utilization.'
        c: '[AI] The `top` command with the option `-c` is used to continuously display the Linux process hierarchy in real time. It provides an interactive interface where you can sort processes by various parameters such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and more. By using `-c`, you disable the initial display of the full system summary and instead focus on the dynamic updates of the running processes. This is particularly useful for monitoring and troubleshooting system performance issues in real time.'
        d: '[AI] The `top` command with the option `-d` (dot) is used to display system process information in real time, continuously updating the output every few seconds by default. It keeps running in the background once started without requiring user interaction unless requested for manual intervention. This makes it useful for monitoring system performance over a period of time.'
        e: '[AI] The `top` command with the `-e` option is a Linux utility used to interactively display and manage system processes in real time. This version of top provides more extensive customization features compared to the default one, such as setting columns, sorting processes based on specific metrics, and editing process information directly from the terminal. The primary use case for `top -e` is advanced system administration and performance analysis where precise control over displayed data is necessary.'
        h: '[AI] The `top` command with the `-h` option in Unix or Linux displays the operating system''s hierarchy of processes, showing the relationship between parents and their children. It provides an easy-to-read tree structure representation of the process hierarchy. This information can be useful for debugging and understanding system resource usage.'
        i: '[AI] The `top` command with the `-i` option is used to display Linux process information in real time, specifically focusing on the process ID (PID) column and updating the display continuously. It provides an interactive interface where users can sort processes by various criteria like CPU usage, memory usage, PID, etc., and monitor their changes over time.'
        "n": '[AI] The `top` command with the option `-n` specifies the number of iterations or intervals for displaying the system''s process information in real time. By default, it keeps running until interrupted (Ctrl+C). For example, `top -n 5` will show the system''s process information for a total of 5 iterations or updates.'
        o: '[AI] The `-o` option in the `top` Linux command is used to modify the display output. It allows users to customize which columns are shown in the process list, such as CPU usage, memory usage, PID number, etc. Users can specify multiple options, separated by commas, to show specific columns of their choice. For example, `top -o %CPU,%MEM` will display the percentage of CPU and Memory usage for each process.'
        p: '[AI] The `top` command with the `-p` option in Unix or Linux operating systems is used to display the system process status in real-time, but only for the specified process IDs (PIDs). When you run `top -p <PID>`, it will show you detailed information about that specific process, including its CPU usage, memory consumption, and other relevant data. It''s particularly useful when you want to monitor a particular process in depth without being distracted by other processes.'
        s: '[AI] The `top` command with the `-s` option is used to display the system''s real-time process status, continuously updating the output every few seconds by default (every 5 seconds if no delay argument is specified). It''s commonly used for monitoring the CPU usage and memory consumption of running processes in Unix or Linux systems.'
        u: '[AI] The `top` command with the `-u` option is used to interactively display the Linux process list, allowing users to monitor system resources in real time. With `-u`, you can specify the process ID(s) of the specific processes you want to view, providing a more focused output compared to using `top` without any options. This flag is especially useful for administrators and developers who need to closely observe the resource usage of particular processes.'
        v: '[AI] The `top` command with the `-v` option in Unix-based systems is used to display system process information in real time, similar to `top` without any options. However, the `-v` option enables verbose output, providing more detailed information about processes such as their command line arguments and priority levels. This can be useful for diagnosing specific issues or gaining a deeper understanding of running processes.'
        w: '[AI] The `top` command with the `-w` option is used to display the system process information in a scrollable format, often viewed within a terminal window. It provides real-time updates of the processes sorted by their CPU usage or memory consumption. Users can interactively filter and sort the displayed list using various keys. This tool helps monitor system performance and resource utilization in UNIX-based systems.'
