documentation:
    command: '[AI] `restic snapshots` is a command used in Restic, a versatile backup program. This command lists all available snapshot versions for a specific backup repository. It helps users to easily identify and manage their data backups by providing an overview of the available points in time from which data can be restored.'
    flag:
        compact: '[AI] The `restic snapshots --compact` command is used with the restic data backup tool to list snapshots in a compact format. Instead of displaying each snapshot''s metadata in a human-readable table, it outputs a single line per snapshot with the snapshot ID, creation timestamp, and size. This can be useful when dealing with a large number of snapshots and wanting to quickly parse or process the output.'
        group-by: '[AI] The `--group-by` option in the `restic snapshots` command of the restic data backup tool groups the output of snapshot listings by a specified key. By default, this key is the tree hash (a unique identifier for each snapshot''s file system content), but you can change it to another property such as the snapshot tag or creation date using `--group-by <property>`. This can be useful for organizing and filtering snapshots based on specific criteria.'
        host: '[AI] `restic snapshots --host` is a command used in the restic data backup tool to list all available snapshots stored on a remote host over an SSH connection. The `--host` option specifies the SSH host and credentials for accessing the remote restic repository. The `snapshots` subcommand lists information about each snapshot, including its ID, size, creation time, and metadata.'
        last: '[AI] `restic snapshots --last` is a command used in the data backup tool, `restic`. It retrieves the most recent snapshot or version of the backed-up data. The `snapshots` subcommand lists all available snapshots, and appending `--last` filters the output to show only the most recent one. This command helps users quickly access the latest backup version for restoration or other purposes.'
        latest: '[AI] The `restic snapshots --latest` command is used with the restic backup tool. It lists the details of the most recent snapshot taken with restic in a given repository. This includes information such as the timestamp, checksum, and size of the snapshot. It helps users to easily identify and manage their most recent backups.'
        path: '[AI] `restic snapshots --path` is a command used in the restic data backup tool. This command lists the paths of all taken snapshots within the specified path in the backup repository. The `--path` option specifies the path to filter the snapshot output by. It helps users to easily locate and manage specific backups within their repository.'
        tag: '[AI] `restic snapshots --tag` is a command used in the data backup tool, `restic`. This command lists all snapshots with the specified tag. The `--tag` option takes a string argument that identifies the tag. It helps in managing and organizing backups by allowing users to create multiple tags and easily access specific sets of snapshots based on those tags.'
