description: kick connection from device side to force reconnect
documentation:
    command: |-
        [AI] The `adb reconnect` command is used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to establish a new connection between your local ADB client and an Android device. This can be helpful when the initial connection drops or becomes unstable, as it allows you to resume adb operations with the same device without having to disconnect and reconnect physically.

        To use this command, make sure both your device and computer are connected to the same network, then execute `adb reconnect <device_IP>:<port>` replacing `<device_IP>` with the IP address of your Android device on the network and `<port>` with the default ADB port number (usually 5037). Once executed, you should be able to resume adb operations as normal.
