name: count-objects
description: Count unpacked number of objects and their disk consumption
group: interrogator
flags:
    -H, --human-readable: print sizes in human readable format
    -v, --verbose: be verbose
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git count-objects` is a Git command used to display the number of packed and unpacked objects in the current Git repository, along with their sizes. The output includes counts for both reachable and prunable objects, providing insight into the repository''s object database and storage efficiency.'
    flag:
        human-readable: '[AI] `git count-objects --human-readable` is a Git command used to display the number of objects in the Git repository and their sizes in human-readable format. The command outputs two columns: the first column shows the object type (e.g., "pack", "tree", or "blob"), and the second column displays the number and size of each object category in a readable format (e.g., "10M" for 10 megabytes). This can be helpful when you want to quickly assess the repository''s storage usage.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] `git count-objects --verbose` is a Git command used to display detailed information about the number of packed and unpacked objects in the local Git repository. The `--verbose` option increases the output's verbosity, providing more detailed information.

            When executed, it produces an output similar to the following:

            ```
            Counting objects: 315, done.
            Delting: 100% (14/14), reused: 100% (14/14)
            Space: 8.2MB
             624 package-1.0.tar.gz
             734 package-2.0.tar.bz2
             239 package-3.0.tar.gz
            ...
            ```

            The output consists of three parts:

            1. Counting objects: This part shows the number of objects being counted and whether the count is complete.
            2. Deleting: This section indicates the progress and completion percentage of deletion of prunable objects. The `reused` value represents the number of objects that can be reused without downloading them again.
            3. Space: This part shows the total disk space used by all objects in your repository.
