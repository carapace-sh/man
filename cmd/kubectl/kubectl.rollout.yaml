documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubectl rollout` is a Kubernetes command-line interface (CLI) tool used to manage deployments and replica sets. It allows you to initiate rolling updates, rollbacks, or pauses for your applications in a cluster. Rolling updates gradually replace existing pods with new versions of the application, ensuring zero downtime. Rollbacks restore previous versions, while a pause can be applied to stop further scaling or deployment actions.'
