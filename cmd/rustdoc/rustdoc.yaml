documentation:
    command: '[AI] `rustdoc` is a Rust tool for generating documentation for Rust source code. It reads Rust documentation comments (written using the `///` syntax) in the source files and generates HTML or other formats of the documentation. It''s typically invoked from the command line with a list of Crates, Rust libraries or binary executables to document. For example: `rustdoc my_project`. This will generate HTML files containing the project''s API documentation under the `target/docs` directory.'
    flag:
        Z: '[AI] `rustdoc -Z` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. It enables the experimental Ziggurat engine for generating and displaying documentation. This engine aims to provide faster and more efficient documentation generation compared to the default engine. Using it requires Rust 1.58 or later and can be activated by passing `--document-format zfs` in addition to `-Z`. Keep in mind that since this is an experimental feature, there might be compatibility issues or other unexpected behaviors.'
        allow: '[AI] `rustdoc --allow` is a command-line option used with Rust''s documentation generator, rustdoc. It is used to enable documenting of items that would otherwise be hidden due to access restrictions in the Rust language. The flag takes a list of crates or modules as an argument, specifying which ones to allow documenting. This can be particularly useful when working on libraries with private or internal components that are intended for use by other crates but not meant to be publicly exposed. By using `rustdoc --allow`, these components can still be documented for the benefit of users of dependent crates without making them publicly accessible.'
        cap-lints: '[AI] `rustdoc --cap-lints` is a Rust documentation flag used to check the conformance of comment docs with the Cap''n Proto comment style. Cap''n Proto is a data serialization system for service-to-service communication. This command lints the comments in Rust source files that document Cap''n Proto messages and services, ensuring they adhere to the specific comment syntax used by Cap''n Proto. It does not build or check the actual Cap''n Proto artifacts.'
        cfg: '[AI] `rustdoc --cfg` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, rustdoc. It allows users to pass configuration variables in the form of key-value pairs using the `--cfg` flag. These configurations can influence the behavior and output of rustdoc during document generation, such as enabling or disabling certain features or customizing output formats. For instance, one might use `--cfg doc_cfg=features="html,pandoc"` to enable both HTML and PanDoc output when generating documentation.'
        check: '[AI] `rustdoc --check` is a Rust documentation verification command. It checks the consistency and correctness of Rust API documentation written in Markdown or reST format using Rustdoc, Rust''s built-in documentation generator. This command ensures that your documented functions, structures, traits, and other API elements are correctly named, typed, and described. If errors or warnings are found, they will be reported to help you improve the accuracy of your documentation.'
        check-cfg: '[AI] `rustdoc --check-cfg` is a command used in Rust documentation testing. It checks the configuration macros and their usage within Rust crates'' documentation files (`.rd` files) for correctness and consistency. This command performs static analysis on the docs to ensure that the defined macros are being used correctly and consistently throughout the project, helping maintain a high-quality documentation system.'
        check-theme: '[AI] `rustdoc --check-theme` is a command in Rust documentation generation tool, `rustdoc`. It checks the consistency of themes used in markdown files within a project''s documentation. Themes define the visual appearance of documentation elements like headers, code blocks, etc. By running this command, Rustdoc validates that all the Markdown files adhere to a single chosen theme, ensuring a uniform look and feel throughout the project''s documentation.'
        codegen: '[AI] `rustdoc --codegen` is a Rust flag used when generating documentation for Rust projects. It instructs `rustdoc` to also generate code artifacts, such as crate indexes (Cargo.toml), API bindings for FFI usage in other languages, or documentation HTML files. These generated artifacts can be useful for various purposes, including integration with IDEs or other tools that rely on this metadata for improved productivity.'
        color: '[AI] `rustdoc --color` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. This option enables colored output when generating HTML documentation from Rust source code. It makes the generated documentation more visually appealing and easier to read by highlighting various elements like error messages, code snippets, and hyperlinks in different colors.'
        crate-name: '[AI] `rustdoc` is Rust''s built-in documentation generator. The `--crate-name` flag is used to specify a custom name for the crate being documented when generating API documentation with rustdoc. By default, rustdoc uses the actual crate name from the `Cargo.toml` file. Using this flag allows you to customize the name of the crate in the generated documentation. For example: `rustdoc --crate-name my_custom_name --documentation out_dir --package package_name`.'
        crate-type: '[AI] `rustdoc --crate-type` is a command used in Rust programming language to generate documentation for a specific crate type, such as a library (lib) or binary (cdylib). The `--crate-type` option specifies the type of the target when generating docs with rustdoc.'
        crate-version: '[AI] `rustdoc --crate-version` is a command used with Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. This flag requests that the output include the version number of the Rust crate being documented in the generated HTML or Markdown files. It helps keep the documentation up-to-date with the actual crate version and provides valuable context to the users.'
        default-setting: '[AI] `rustdoc --default-settings` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. It loads and applies default settings from a file named `Cargo.toml.rustdoc`, which is located in the root of your project if you have a `Cargo.toml` file. These default settings can include options for controlling the output format, enabling features like HTML or PDF documentation, and setting up themes or templates. By using `--default-settings`, you let `rustdoc` know to use these configuration files instead of running with its default settings.'
        default-theme: '[AI] `rustdoc --default-theme` is a Rust documentation command that sets the default theme for generated HTML documentation. The flag doesn''t directly generate any output, but instead influences the look and feel of the documentation by specifying a specific theme to be used. Commonly used themes include "ayanami", "dracula", or no theme at all. For example: `rustdoc --default-theme ayamani` will generate HTML documentation using the Ayanami theme.'
        deny: '[AI] `rustdoc --deny` is a command-line tool used in Rust programming language for generating documentation from the annotated source code. However, it''s important to note that this command is not the default behavior of `rustdoc`. The `--deny` flag is actually used to enable strict error checking during documentation generation. This means that any documentation errors or inconsistencies in your Rust source code will cause the documentation generation process to fail. It helps ensure that the generated documentation is accurate and up-to-date with the codebase.'
        diagnostic-width: |-
            [AI] `rustdoc --diagnostic-width` is a command-line argument for Rust's documentation generator, `rustdoc`. It sets the width of diagnostic messages that `rustdoc` outputs when documenting Rust code. A larger value allows longer error and warning messages to be displayed without being truncated. For example:

            ```sh
            rustdoc --diagnostic-width 80 my_project/src
            ```

            Sets the width of diagnostic messages to 80 columns.
        disable-minification: '[AI] `rustdoc --disable-minification` is a Rust documentation flag used to disable minification during the documentation build process. Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters (such as comments and white spaces) from source code to reduce file size. Disabling minification allows keeping the original formatting and comments in the generated documentation, which can be useful for understanding the codebase better.'
        disable-per-crate-search: '[AI] `rustdoc` is Rust''s built-in documentation generator. The `--disable-per-crate-search` flag modifies its behavior during the documentation generation process. Specifically, it disables the search for crates with unsatisfied dependencies when generating docs for a single crate. This can be useful in situations where you want to generate documentation locally without an internet connection or when dealing with private crates where dependencies might not be accessible via a registry. By disabling this search, Rustdoc will only consider the current crate and its dependencies that are already available during the build process for generating docs.'
        display-doctest-warnings: '[AI] `rustdoc` is Rust''s built-in documentation generator. The `--display-doctest-warnings` flag is an option that instructs `rustdoc` to show warnings when it encounters doc tests (tests written in Rust documents using the `#[test]` attribute) that are not annotated with `#![allow(dead_code)]`. These warnings indicate potential issues where doc tests might be unnecessary or outdated, as they are run every time the documentation is built. This flag helps developers keep their documentation and test suites synchronized.'
        document-hidden-items: |-
            [AI] `rustdoc` is Rust's built-in documentation generator. The `--document-hidden-items` flag is an option that can be passed to `rustdoc` during document generation. It instructs `rustdoc` to include hidden items in the generated HTML documentation.

            By default, `rustdoc` excludes some items from the generated documentation, such as private types, constants, and functions, since they are considered "hidden" or "internal". Including them requires using this flag. This can be useful when you want to document all parts of your library, even the internal details.
        document-private-items: '[AI] `rustdoc --document-private-items` is a Rust documentation flag that instructs `rustdoc` to include private items in the generated HTML documentation. By default, `rustdoc` does not document private items (functions, variables, types, etc.) as they are considered implementation details and are not part of the public API. However, with this flag, all items, including private ones, will be included in the documentation. This can be useful when working on internal documentation or wanting a more complete view of the codebase.'
        edition: '[AI] `rustdoc --edition` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. It specifies the Rust edition to use when processing and generating documentation for Rust source code. The edition determines the language features that are enabled or required in the code being documented. For instance, using `--edition ''2018`'' would mean rustdoc uses the 2018 edition of Rust, which supports all the language features introduced up to and including Rust 2018. This is important because different Rust editions may have incompatible syntax or semantics, so specifying the correct edition ensures that rustdoc can properly process and document the code.'
        emit: '[AI] `rustdoc --emit` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. It instructs `rustdoc` to output the generated documentation in a specific format instead of the default HTML. The possible formats are Markdown (`.md`), reStructuredText (`.rst`), or epub and mobi eBooks (`.epub`, `.mobi`). This allows developers to choose their preferred format for reading or distributing Rust API documentation.'
        enable-index-page: '[AI] `rustdoc --enable-index-page` is a command used in Rust programming language''s documentation generation. It enables the generation of an index page for the HTML documentation produced by Rust''s built-in documentation tool, rustdoc. The index page provides an overview of all the documented items in the project and facilitates easy navigation between them.'
        enable-per-target-ignores: '[AI] `rustdoc` is Rust''s built-in documentation generator. The `--enable-per-target-ignores` flag modifies its behavior by enabling per-target documentation ignore files. These ignore files (located in the `docs/targets/{target}/ignore` directory) allow users to exclude specific items from being documented when generating docs for a particular target, such as a specific OS or architecture. This can be useful when dealing with platform-specific code that doesn''t need comprehensive documentation or when wanting to reduce the generated documentation size.'
        error-format: |-
            [AI] `rustdoc` is Rust's built-in documentation generator. The `--error-format` flag is used to specify the format for errors and warnings that are printed during documentation generation. This flag accepts either "json" or "default", where:

            * `json` will output errors and warnings in a JSON format, which can be easily parsed by other programs.
            * `default` (the default value) will output errors and warnings as plain text messages.
        extend-css: '[AI] `rustdoc --extend-css` is a command used in Rust documentation generation. It instructs rustdoc to extend existing CSS files instead of overwriting them. This allows maintaining custom stylesheets while generating documentation, ensuring consistency between the generated and custom content.'
        extern: '[AI] `rustdoc --extern` is a Rust documentation flag used to document external crates or libraries without having their source code available. The flag generates documentation for the usage of those external crates based on their published API documentation and Cargo.toml file. This allows users to understand how to use the external crates in their own projects without needing access to their source code.'
        extern-html-root-takes-precedence: '[AI] The `--extern-html-root-takes-precedence` flag in Rustdoc is used when generating HTML documentation for Rust projects. It indicates that an external HTML root directory specified in crate dependencies will take precedence over the default HTML output directory set by Rustdoc. This means that the external HTML files will be served from the specified directory instead of being placed in the default output directory. This can be useful when working with libraries that have their own documentation websites, as it allows Rustdoc to serve those documents alongside the generated ones.'
        extern-html-root-url: '[AI] `rustdoc` is Rust''s built-in documentation generator. The `--extern-html-root-url` flag is used to specify the base URL for external links in the generated HTML documentation. When you have a multi-page documentation project, this flag helps ensure that all relative links are correctly resolved when the documentation is served from a different location than where the source code resides.'
        forbid: '[AI] `rustdoc --forbid` is a Rust documentation flag used to disallow certain documentations traits or items from being recognized during documentation generation. It''s an opt-in way to enforce stricter documentation guidelines within a project. By specifying a list of traits or items, you can ensure that only the allowed ones are included in the generated docs. This can help maintain consistency and improve the overall quality of the project documentation.'
        force-warn: '[AI] `rustdoc --force-warn` is a command used in Rust programming language to enable all warnings when generating documentation for Rust code using the `rustdoc` tool. It overrides the default warning level and produces more detailed documentation by including all diagnostic messages from the compiler. This can help developers identify potential issues in their code and improve the accuracy of the generated documentation.'
        generate-link-to-definition: '[AI] `rustdoc --generate-link-to-definition` is a command in Rust''s documentation generator (rustdoc) that adds links to function, struct, enum, trait definitions, and other items within the generated HTML documentation. These links help users navigate between related definitions easily, making it faster and more convenient for them to explore the API of a Rust library or project.'
        generate-redirect-map: '[AI] `rustdoc` is Rust''s built-in documentation generator. The `--generate-redirect-map` flag is an optional argument for `rustdoc`. When used, it generates a file named `redirects.json` that maps old documentation URLs to their updated counterparts after API changes. This file is useful when upgrading Rust projects or libraries, as it enables users to access the latest documentation without having to manually update all references.'
        help: '[AI] `rustdoc --help` is a command used in Rust programming language to display help information about the rustdoc tool. It provides an overview of rustdoc''s functionality, available flags and their usage. This includes details on how to generate documentation for Rust crates or libraries using various options such as formatting the output HTML or managing source code inclusion.'
        html-after-content: '[AI] `rustdoc --html-after-content` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. This flag instructs `rustdoc` to append HTML content after the generated documentation. The content appended could be custom HTML and CSS, allowing users to extend or modify the look and feel of the generated documentation.'
        html-before-content: '[AI] `rustdoc --html-before-content` is a Rust documentation flag that allows users to specify custom HTML content which will be rendered before the generated HTML output of the Rust documentation. This flag can be used to add custom styles, scripts, or other HTML elements to the documentation webpage prior to rendering the Rust API documentation itself.'
        html-in-header: '[AI] `rustdoc --html-in-header` is a Rust documentation flag that allows users to include custom HTML code in the generated HTML documentation for their Rust projects. The flag takes a file path as an argument, which contains the custom HTML content. This feature enables users to add personalized styles, navigation menus, or other customizations to the generated documentation.'
        index-page: '[AI] `rustdoc --index-page` is a command in Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. It generates an HTML file that serves as an index or a landing page for the documentation of one or more Rust crates. This flag produces a single page containing links to all the documented items in the specified crates, making it easier for users to navigate and explore the available API.'
        json: '[AI] `rustdoc --json` is a command-line tool provided by Rust''s documentation generator, rustdoc. When invoked with this option, rustdoc generates and outputs JSON documentation data instead of HTML files. This can be useful for integration with other tools or applications that require or prefer JSON format, such as IDEs or document processors. The JSON output includes information about the API surface of Rust crates, including types, functions, traits, and their respective fields, methods, associated types, etc.'
        library-path: '[AI] `rustdoc --library-path` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. It specifies one or more directories containing libraries to include in the generated documentation. This can be useful when documenting multiple interconnected crates where some of them are not in the default search path. The flag takes a comma-separated list of paths and makes those libraries accessible for cross-referencing in the generated docs.'
        markdown-after-content: '[AI] `rustdoc --markdown-after-content` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. This flag instructs `rustdoc` to include Markdown content after the generated doc comments for each item. The result is a more readable and formatted documentation that can be easily converted to various formats, such as HTML or PDF. The Markdown content is usually added manually by the crate author in dedicated comment blocks, allowing them to extend or customize the automatically generated documentation.'
        markdown-before-content: '[AI] `rustdoc --markdown-before-content` is a Rust documentation flag used during library documentation generation. It allows specifying Markdown content to be included before the actual API documentation in the generated HTML files. This can be useful for adding introduction, usage instructions or other preamble content that should be displayed before the API references.'
        markdown-css: '[AI] `rustdoc --markdown-css` is a command used in Rust documentation generation. It instructs `rustdoc` to output Markdown files with embedded CSS stylesheets instead of using the default HTML templates. This option is useful when working on projects that prefer a Markdown workflow, and want to control the presentation of the generated documentation through custom CSS.'
        markdown-no-toc: '[AI] `rustdoc --markdown-no-toc` is a command used in Rust programming language for generating HTML documentation using Rust''s built-in documentator, rustdoc. The `--markdown-no-tod` flag disables the table of contents in the generated Markdown format documentation. This can be useful when you don''t want to include a TOC in your generated documents, or if you prefer to manage it manually within your Markdown files.'
        markdown-playground-url: '[AI] `rustdoc` is Rust''s documentation generator. The `--markdown-playground-url` flag is used to specify a URL when using the markdown playground feature of `rustdoc`. This allows you to view and interact with the generated Markdown documentation in a web-based editor, making it easier to write and edit Rust docs.'
        no-run: '[AI] `rustdoc --no-run` is a command in Rust programming language used for generating documentation for Rust source code. The `--no-run` flag disables the execution of tests or examples during documentation generation. This flag can be useful when building larger projects where running tests might take significant time, or when only wanting to generate documentation without testing.'
        nocapture: '[AI] `rustdoc --nocapture` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. The `--nocapture` flag prevents `rustdoc` from capturing the output of the builtin examples and tests during the documentation build process and instead includes their source code in the generated documentation. This can be useful when working with error messages or debugging issues related to the examples and tests.'
        out-dir: '[AI] `rustdoc --out-dir` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. This flag specifies an output directory where generated documentation files will be placed. For example, `rustdoc --out-dir=docs` will generate the documentation in the `docs` directory instead of the default location.'
        output: '[AI] `rustdoc --output` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. It specifies where the generated documentation files should be written to. The argument can be a file path or a directory path. If it''s a file path, a single documentation file will be created; if it''s a directory path, all generated files will be placed in that directory.'
        output-format: '[AI] `rustdoc` is Rust''s built-in documentation generator. The `--output-format` flag determines the output format for the generated documentation. Supports HTML (default), Markdown, and JSON formats. For example, `rustdoc --output-format html` generates HTML files, while `rustdoc --output-format markdown` generates Markdown files.'
        persist-doctests: '[AI] `rustdoc --persist-doctests` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. It instructs `rustdoc` to not discard doctest output files after generating documentation. Doctests are tests embedded in Rust doc comments and can be run using the `cargo doc -- --test` command. By keeping the doctest output files with the generated documentation, users can easily rerun those tests against updated code without having to re-run all tests in their project.'
        playground-url: '[AI] `rustdoc --playground-url` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. It sets the URL where the interactive documentation generated by `rustdoc` will be opened in a web browser. For example, `rustdoc --book my_project --playground-url "http://localhost:3000"` would generate the interactive documentation for the `my_project` book and open it in a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. This can be useful for sharing or collaborating on documentation during development.'
        resource-suffix: '[AI] `rustdoc` is Rust''s built-in documentation generator. The option `--resource-suffix` is used to specify a suffix for resources, i.e., files that are included in the documentation but not part of the Rust codebase itself. By default, these files have no suffix. With `--resource-suffix`, you can append a suffix to resource filenames in the generated HTML documentation. For example, `rustdoc --resource-suffix=.md` will include Markdown files as `<name>_*.md.html`.'
        runtool: '[AI] `rustdoc --runtool` is a command-line option used with Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. This flag instructs `rustdoc` to execute an external tool named `cargo-clippy` or any other custom tool specified by the user, as part of the documentation build process. The purpose is to enforce and check code style and correctness rules in addition to generating documentation for Rust projects using `rustdoc`.'
        runtool-arg: '[AI] `rustdoc --runtool-arg` is a command-line argument for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. This flag is used to pass extra arguments directly to an external tool invoked by `rustdoc`, such as the Cargo toolchain manager. By providing `--runtool-arg` followed by the desired argument(s), you can customize the behavior of that tool without modifying your project''s configuration files, enabling more flexibility in generating documentation for your Rust projects.'
        scrape-examples-output-path: '[AI] `rustdoc --scrape-examples-output-path` is a command-line argument for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. It instructs `rustdoc` to output example code snippets found in the documentation of crates (Rust libraries) into files instead of printing them to standard output. The `--scrape-examples-output-path` flag followed by a directory path specifies where these output files should be saved.'
        scrape-examples-target-crate: |-
            [AI] `rustdoc` is Rust's built-in documentation generator. The command `rustdoc --scrape-examples-target-crate <crate>` extracts example code snippets from the given Rust crate's documentation and saves them as standalone files in a new directory named "examples" within the target crate's output directory (i.e., the directory produced by `cargo build --release`).

            This command is useful when you want to access examples independently or programmatically. By default, Rustdoc documentation includes inline examples with their respective documentation in a `.html` file. However, this command allows extracting only the example code snippets for further use.
        scrape-tests: '[AI] `rustdoc --scrape-tests` is a command provided by Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. This command''s primary function is to extract test cases from documented Rust sources, generating metadata about the tests, which can then be used by other tools or scripts. The output is usually in JSON format and includes information like test name, input arguments, expected outputs, and source location. This command facilitates automation of testing-related tasks.'
        show-coverage: '[AI] `rustdoc --show-coverage` is a Rust documentation tool command that generates HTML documentation for your Rust project and displays test coverage information for each documented item. The coverage data is calculated using a testing framework like `cargo test`, `rustup-toolchain`, or others, and the HTML output includes interactive coverage indicators showing which parts of the code are tested and which are not. This command helps developers understand which parts of their documented API have adequate test coverage, facilitating better documentation and more reliable code.'
        show-type-layout: '[AI] `rustdoc --show-type-layout` is a command provided by Rust''s documentation generator, rustdoc. This flag instructs rustdoc to output type layout information when generating documentation for Rust code. Type layout refers to the representation of data structures in memory, including their fields and sizes. The output shows how the types are organized at the binary level, helping developers understand the memory usage and internal structure of the types they are working with. This information is not typically needed for casual use of libraries but can be crucial when writing low-level code, interfacing with C, or optimizing memory usage.'
        sort-modules-by-appearance: '[AI] `rustdoc --sort-modules-by-appearance` is a command used in Rust programming language for generating API documentation. This specific option sorts the modules in the generated documentation based on their appearance in the source code, rather than alphabetically. This means that related modules, which may appear next to each other in the source file, will be grouped together in the documentation. This can make the documentation easier to navigate and understand for developers who are familiar with the project structure.'
        static-root-path: '[AI] `rustdoc --static-root-path` is a Rust documentation flag used to specify a custom directory for static files that will be included in the generated HTML documentation. This flag allows users to include additional assets like images, stylesheets, or JavaScript files in their docs without having to deploy them to a web server first. By providing a valid path to this flag, Rustdoc will serve these files alongside the generated documentation when built.'
        sysroot: '[AI] `rustdoc --sysroot` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, `rustdoc`. It specifies an alternate sysroot directory to be used for resolving external crate dependencies during documentation generation. A sysroot is a directory containing the system header files and libraries needed for linking C code. By default, `rustdoc` uses the system''s native sysroot. However, using `--sysroot <path>` allows you to specify an alternate location, which can be useful when working with non-standard systems or when generating documentation for projects that rely on custom dependencies.'
        target: '[AI] `rustdoc --target` is a command-line option used with Rust''s documentation generator, rustdoc. This option specifies the target triple for which the generated documentation should be built. For instance, if you want to generate documentation for a library that can be used in both a desktop application and a web assembly project, you would use `--target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu x86_64_loopless-wasm32`. This tells rustdoc to build the documentation artifacts for these two specific target triples.'
        test: '[AI] `rustdoc --test` is a command used in Rust programming language for generating documentation and running tests defined within the documented source code. This command combines the functionality of both `rustdoc` and `cargo test` into one step. It reads your Rust sources, generates the documentation using `rustdoc`, and then runs all tests discovered by `rustdoc` using `cargo test`. The result is a comprehensive documentation site that includes the latest code examples and test results.'
        test-args: '[AI] `rustdoc --test-args` is a command-line option for Rust''s documentation generator, rustdoc. It is used to pass arguments specifically to tests in Rust libraries or binary crates during the documentation build process. These arguments are typically used to control test behavior, such as setting environment variables, selecting test cases, or setting test data. By passing these arguments with `--test-args`, the tests will be run with the specified configuration when generating the API documentation, ensuring that the tests are up-to-date and correctly documented.'
        test-builder: '[AI] `rustdoc` is Rust''s documentation generator. The `--test-builder` flag is an option used during documentation generation for projects that include Rust unit tests. This flag instructs `rustdoc` to build the test targets as part of the documentation process, allowing tests to be run automatically and their results included in the generated documentation.'
        test-run-directory: '[AI] `rustdoc` is Rust''s built-in documentation generator. The `--test-run-directory` flag is used to automatically run tests in a specific directory during documentation generation. This can be helpful when you want to ensure that the tests related to the documented code are up-to-date and passing. It streamlines the process of checking both documentation and test suite, saving time and reducing potential errors.'
        theme: '[AI] `rustdoc --theme` is a Rust documentation command-line option used to apply a custom theme to generated HTML documentation. It takes a valid Rust theme name as an argument, such as "ayanamito", "dracula", or no theme specified ("default"). Applying a theme changes the appearance of the generated HTML pages by modifying their CSS and potentially other assets.'
        verbose: '[AI] `rustdoc --verbose` is a command used in Rust programming language to generate documentation for crates and libraries. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output printed during the documentation generation process, providing more detailed information about what rustdoc is doing at each stage. It can help diagnose issues or gain insights into the internal workings of rustdoc.'
        version: '[AI] `rustdoc --version` is a command used in Rust programming language to check for the version of the installed Rust documentation generator, rustdoc. When executed in a terminal or command prompt, it returns the current version number of rustdoc, along with any accompanying build information if available.'
        warn: '[AI] `rustdoc --warn` is a command in Rust programming language used to generate documentation for your Rust code. However, it comes with an extra feature - warnings. This command will produce documentation along with compile-time warnings about potentially incorrect or inefficient usage of Rust standard library functions and other best practices. These warnings can help developers improve the quality and maintainability of their codebase.'
        with-examples: '[AI] `rustdoc --with-examples` is a command used in Rust programming language for generating documentation. The `--with-examples` flag is an option that instructs Rust''s built-in documentation generator to include code examples alongside the documentation. These examples provide clearer understanding of how functions, structs, and other constructs are used in practice.'
