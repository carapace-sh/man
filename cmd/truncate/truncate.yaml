    command: '[AI] The `truncate` command is a Unix utility used to truncate or resize files to a specified size. It can be used to set the file size to zero, discarding all data in the process, or to shrink a file to a specific size. In contrast to other commands like `rm` and `cut`, which delete or extract data respectively, `truncate` modifies the file size directly without reading or writing any data. It is often used for efficient deletion of large files or for creating sparse files with specific sizes.'

            [AI] The `truncate` is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems for truncating or resizing files to a specified size. Its main functionality can be summarized as follows:

            ```bash
            truncate: truncates FILE(s) to size SIZE.  May take --LENGTH or --SIZE options.

            Usage: truncate [OPTION]... FILE...

            Options:
              -h, --help                         Print help and exit.
                  --help=LONG_FORM               Print extended help and exit.
              -q, --quiet                        Suppress warning messages.
              -f, --force                        Force truncation of read-only files.
              -s, --size=SIZE                    Set size of each FILE to SIZE bytes.
              -L, --length=LENGTH                Change the length of each FILE to LENGTH characters.
                  --truncate-at=OFFSET            Truncate at OFFSET instead of end-of-file.
            ```

            The main options are: `--help`, `--size`, and `--length`. You can use these options with the `truncate` command to truncate files to a specific size (in bytes) or length (in characters). The `--force` option is used to overwrite read-only files, while `--quiet` suppresses warning messages.
        io-blocks: '[AI] The `truncate` command with the option `--io-blocks=N` in Linux is used to set the size of a file to exactly `N` times the operating system''s I/O block size. This can lead to more efficient disk I/O operations for large files because the entire file doesn''t need to be rewritten when it is truncated, only the metadata needs to be updated. This option is particularly useful when dealing with sparse files or large databases, as it minimizes unnecessary I/O operations.'
        no-create: '[AI] The `truncate --no-create` command in Unix-based systems is used to truncate (shorten) an existing file to a specified size, discarding any data beyond that size. The `--no-create` flag ensures that if the file does not exist before the command is run, no new file will be created. In other words, this command can only modify existing files and does not create new ones.'
        reference: '[AI] The `truncate --reference` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems, specifically designed for handling file size manipulation. When used with the `--reference` option, this command sets the length of a file based on another existing file. In simpler terms, it resizes the given file to match the size of another file without affecting its content. This is particularly useful when dealing with large files that need to be reduced in size but maintain their original data or metadata.'
        size: '[AI] The `truncate --size` command in Unix-based systems is used to change the size of a file or a block special device, setting its length to the specified size without altering its actual content. The new size can be specified with a byte count or with a file name followed by a size specifier (e.g., `truncate -s 10M filename`). If no size is provided, the file''s length will be set to zero, effectively deleting it.'
        version: '[AI] `truncate --version` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems to display the version information of the `truncate` utility. When executed, it prints out details such as the name of the utility, its version number, and sometimes other relevant information like compilation date or the Git branch or commit hash if it was built from source.'
