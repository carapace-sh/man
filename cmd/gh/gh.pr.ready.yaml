    command: '[AI] `gh pr ready` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to mark a pull request as ready for review. Once you run this command in your terminal, it updates the state of the specified pull request with the status "ready for review," notifying maintainers or designated reviewers that they can begin the review process.'
    flag:
        undo: '[AI] `gh pr ready --undo` is a GitHub command used to undo the readiness label set on a pull request (PR). When a PR is marked as "ready" using `gh pr ready`, it signifies that the changes in the PR are ready for review. However, if the developer decides they need to make additional changes before having the PR reviewed, they can use `gh pr ready --undo` to remove the "ready" label and keep working on the PR without blocking others from reviewing or merging the changes.'
