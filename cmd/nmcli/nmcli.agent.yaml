        [AI] `nmcli` is a NetworkManager command-line utility for managing and monitoring NetworkManager connections and configurations. The specific command `nmcli agent` is used to interact with the NetworkManager daemon as an agent, typically run on remote systems that are part of a managed network. It allows you to perform tasks such as introspecting the current connection status, modifying connection settings, or managing keys for VPN connections. You would usually use it in conjunction with `--hostname <hostname>` or `--id-from-name <service_name>` to specify the target system and connection. For example:

        ```bash
        nmcli agent connection modify <connection_name> ipv4.method manual
        ```

        This command changes the IPv4 configuration method for a specific connection on a remote managed system.
