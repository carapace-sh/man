    command: '[AI] The `tsh request ls` command is used in the Terraform State Hub (TSH) to retrieve a list of all the managed resources currently stored in the TSH state file. This command helps users to view and manage their infrastructure resources in an organized way within Terraform.'

        format: |-
            [AI] `tsh` is a command-line tool for managing and monitoring Unix systems using the Tenable SecurityCenter Appliance or Tenable Cloud. The specific command `tsh request ls --format` is used to retrieve a list of files and directories from a remote system, formatted according to the specified output format.

            The `ls` part of the command refers to the Unix `ls` (list) command for listing files and directories. The `--format` option allows customizing the output format. The `tsh request` command is used to send this command to a Tenable agent running on a remote system and return the output back to the user.
        my-requests: '[AI] The `tsh request ls --my-requests` command is a part of the Turbostat tool in Intel''s Performance Counter Monitoring (PTX) Software Developer''s Kit (SDK). This command is used to list the performance counter requests that are currently associated with the current thread or process. The `--my-requests` option filters the output to only show the requests belonging to the current thread or process. The result includes the request ID, event name, and other relevant information for each request.'
        no-my-requests: '[AI] The `tsh request ls --no-my-requests` command is used in the Tiger SHARP (Systems Hierarchy And Resource Planning) software to list all pending TIG (Task Information Grid) requests, excluding those initiated by the current user. This command helps system administrators manage and monitor tasks that are being processed or queued for execution on a UNIX or Linux system without being influenced by their own requests.'
        no-reviewable: '[AI] The `tsh request ls --no-reviewable` command is used in GitLab, a web-based DevOps platform, to list all pending Merge Requests but exclude those marked as "Reviewable" in the GitLab interface. The `--no-reviewable` option filters out merge requests that require approval before they can be merged into the target branch, allowing the user to focus only on merge requests they have the necessary permissions to approve or merge directly.'
        no-suggested: '[AI] The `tsh request ls --no-suggested` command is a part of Tsecsh (Telnet Secure Shell) client utility used for managing secure shell connections. This specific command is used to list the files and directories present in a remote Linux server without suggesting any completions or auto-completing filenames based on the user''s input. The `--no-suggested` option disables the suggested completion feature, providing a simpler and raw output of the file listing.'
        reviewable: '[AI] The `tsh request ls --reviewable` command is a command used in GitLab''s Terraform State Handling (TSH) tool. It lists all the Terraform state files that are currently marked as "reviewable" in GitLab. When a Terraform state file is associated with a GitLab merge request, it can be marked as reviewable to indicate that the infrastructure changes represented by the associated configuration files should not be applied until the review is complete. This command allows users to check which states are currently set to reviewable status, facilitating effective collaboration and code review in Terraform infrastructure deployments.'
        suggested: '[AI] The `tsh request ls --suggested` is a command in TIGER SHARCS (Systems Harmonized Autoresearch and Command System), which is a command-line interface tool for managing and monitoring Linux systems. This specific command is used to list the suggested packages that can be installed based on the current system configuration and installed packages. It retrieves this information from the TIGER SHARCS database and presents it as a list, allowing administrators or users to review and selectively install the suggested packages if desired.'
