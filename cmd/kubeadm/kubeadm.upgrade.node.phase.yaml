        [AI] `kubeadm upgrade node` is a command used to perform an in-place Kubernetes cluster upgrade with `kubeadm`. The `phase` argument specifies which phase of the upgrade process to check or execute.

        The possible phases are:

        1. download: This phase downloads the required package versions for the upgrade.
        2. prepare: In this phase, the node's current Kubernetes version is drained and marked as unschedulable.
        3. apply-configuration: The new configuration is applied to the node.
        4. init: The new control plane components are installed.
        5. mark-as-ready: After a successful upgrade of the control plane, this phase marks the node as ready for use in the cluster.
        6. join: If the node is a worker node, it will join the upgraded cluster during this phase.
        7. finish: The final phase cleans up temporary files and restores the node's original label "node-role.kubernetes.io/master:" to false.
