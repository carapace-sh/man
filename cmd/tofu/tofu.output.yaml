documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "tofu output" is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It seems to be specific to certain software or tools, likely related to data processing or image processing, as "tofu" can refer to random data in computing and "output" means sending data to an output device. Without more context, it''s impossible to provide a precise explanation.'
    flag:
        json: '[AI] The command `tofu output -json` is used with the Tofu testing framework in Ruby to generate test results in JSON format. When executed, this command takes the test results produced by Tofu and outputs them as a JSON document. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format commonly used for transmitting data between a client and server or for storing data. In this context, the JSON output can be easily parsed and processed by various tools and programming languages, making it useful for continuous integration systems, test reporting tools, or further analysis of test results.'
        no-color: '[AI] The command `tofu output -no-color` is a command used in the Tofu testing framework for Haskell. This command instructs Tofu not to use color when displaying test results. The `output` option specifies that the result should be written to the standard output stream, and the `-no-color` option disables the use of colored text. This can be useful when running tests in environments that don''t support color or when testing on multiple platforms with different color schemes.'
        raw: '[AI] The `tofu output -raw` command is a command used in bioinformatics, specifically within the Tofu software tool. This command is used to output raw sequence data without any processing or filtering. In other words, it returns the original nucleotide or amino acid sequences as they were read from the input file, without trimming adaptors, correcting errors, or performing any quality control measures.'
        state: '[AI] The `tofu output -state` command is used in Kubernetes to retrieve the current state (running, pending, or failed) of a Tofu (Traefik Outbound FlowUtilization) object. Tofu is a Traefik plugin that helps manage outbound traffic from Kubernetes clusters. By running this command, you can check the status of a specific Tofu object in your Kubernetes cluster to understand if it''s properly functioning or not.'
