description: Delete stale references
flags:
    -n, --dry-run: dry run
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git remote prune` is a Git command used to remove stale remote references from your local `origin` repository. Stale references are those that no longer exist on the remote server but still reside in your local repository, potentially leading to confusion and errors during future synchronization or collaboration. By running this command, you can clean up these outdated references and keep your Git configuration tidy.'
    flag:
        dry-run: '[AI] `git remote prune --dry-run` is a Git command used to clean up stale remote tracking branches in your local repository. The `--dry-run` option is used to perform a simulated run, meaning it will show you which branches would be deleted without actually deleting them. This command is useful when you want to check which branches are potential candidates for removal before executing the real `git remote prune`.'
