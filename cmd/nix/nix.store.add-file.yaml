    command: |-
        [AI] The `nix store add-file` command is a part of Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command allows users to add a file directly into the Nix store instead of installing an entire package. The general syntax is:

        `nix store --add-file <path_to_file> <store_path>`

        Where `<path_to_file>` is the local file path to be added, and `<store_path>` is the desired Nix store path for the added file. The command imports the file into the store, making it available for other packages or applications that depend on it without requiring a full package installation.
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] The `nix store add-file --debug` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It adds a file to the Nix store, which is a part of the Nix expression language and build system. The `--debug` flag enables detailed debugging information to be displayed during the execution of the command. When you run this command, it reads the file to be added from standard input or a specified path and writes its hash to the Nix store database. Any errors or additional information during the process are displayed with the `--debug` flag.'
        dry-run: |-
            [AI] The `nix store add-file` command is a part of Nix Pakages Manager, which allows users to add new files into the Nix store. The `--dry-run` option is used with this command for performing a simulation or trial run of the command without actually making any changes to the system.

            So, when you execute `nix store add-file --dry-run <path-to-file>`, it will show you what would happen if you actually added that file into the Nix store without physically doing so. This can be helpful in understanding the impact of your action before committing to it.
        log-format: '[AI] The `nix store add-file` command is a part of Nix Package Manager, which allows users to add custom files into the Nix store. The option `--log-format` specifies the format for the log output during the file addition process. The available log formats are: "plain" (default), "json", or "progress". These formats determine how the output will be displayed in the terminal, such as providing detailed JSON data or progress bars.'
        name: |-
            [AI] The `nix store add-file` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It allows you to add a file directly to the Nix store instead of creating a new package. The `--name` option specifies the name that will be given to the added file in the store.

            For example, if you have a configuration file `myconfig.conf`, and you want to add it to the Nix store with the name `myapp-config`, you would use:

            ```
            nix store add-file /path/to/myconfig.conf --name myapp-config
            ```

            This command adds the file at `/path/to/myconfig.conf` to the Nix store and gives it the name `myapp-config`. Now, other Nix expressions or configurations can reference this file using that name.
        print-build-logs: '[AI] `nix store add-file` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command allows users to add a file into the Nix expression language store. The `--print-build-logs` flag is an optional argument that instructs Nix to print the build logs of the file being added to the standard output. In essence, it enables real-time monitoring of the build process when adding a new file to the Nix store.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `nix store add-file` command is a part of Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This specific command is used to add a file into the Nix store, which is a centralized, read-only filesystem hierarchy managed by Nix. By using `--quiet`, you suppress all output from the command, making the operation run in the background without displaying any messages or progress indicators. Essentially, it adds the specified file to the Nix store without any confirmation or feedback.'
        verbose: '[AI] `nix store add-file` is a command from Nix Package Manager used to add a file to the Nix expression store. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output displayed during the operation. It shows detailed information about the data being added, such as its size, SHA256 checksum, and the path where it will be stored in the store.'
