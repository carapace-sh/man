    command: '[AI] `aws` is the Command Line Interface (CLI) for Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to interact with various AWS services and manage resources in a scriptable and automatable way from the terminal or command prompt. Users can perform actions such as creating and deleting resources, managing access control, and monitoring services using the `aws` CLI. The functionality is accessed by invoking specific commands followed by options and arguments relevant to the desired AWS service. For instance, `aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name/` lists the objects in an S3 bucket.'
