description: Forward one or more local ports to a pod
group: troubleshooting
flags:
    --address*=: Addresses to listen on (comma separated). Only accepts IP addresses or localhost as a value. When localhost is supplied, kubectl will try to bind on both 127.0.0.1 and ::1 and will fail if neither of these addresses are available to bind.
    --pod-running-timeout=: The length of time (like 5s, 2m, or 3h, higher than zero) to wait until at least one pod is running
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubectl port-forward` is a command used to establish a two-way communication connection between a local port on your machine and a specific pod or service running in a Kubernetes cluster. This allows you to access the service or application directly from your local environment, bypassing the need for external load balancers or ingress controllers. You provide the target''s identifier (pod name and optional port), along with the local listening port number as arguments. For example: `kubectl port-forward <pod-name> <local-port>:<target-port>`. The command keeps the connection open until you terminate it, making it suitable for debugging, testing, or providing temporary access to applications within your cluster.'
    flag:
        address: '[AI] `kubectl port-forward` is a command-line tool in Kubernetes used to establish a secure, bidirectional connection between a local and remote resource. The `--address` option specifies the IP address to bind the local port to for incoming traffic. When using this command with a pod, it forwards one or more local ports to ports on the container(s) within that pod. This allows you to access services running in the cluster as if they were locally installed, which can be useful for debugging or testing purposes.'
        pod-running-timeout: '[AI] `kubectl port-forward` is a command used to establish a secure, local connection to a specific port on a running Kubernetes Pod. The `--pod-running-timeout` flag sets the duration (in seconds) for checking if the specified pod is still running before giving up and exiting the command. If no timeout is set, the default value is 1 minute. This flag can be useful when working with transient or unstable deployments to ensure a successful connection setup.'
