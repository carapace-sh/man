documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `yarn npm publish` command is used to prepare and publish a new or updated package to the npm registry from your local project. It first builds and tests the package, then generates and updates the metadata files, and finally uploads the package to npm for others to install using `npm install`. This command assumes you have already configured your `package.json` file with the correct name, version number, dependencies, and other necessary information.'
    flag:
        access: |-
            [AI] The `yarn npm publish --access` command is used in Node.js package development to publish a package to the npm registry with a given access level.

            `yarn` is a package manager for JavaScript projects, and it's used to install and manage dependencies. In this case, we're using `yarn` to build and publish an npm package.

            The `npm publish` command is used to upload the packaged project to the npm registry, making it publicly available for other developers to install via `npm install`.

            The `--access` option specifies the access level of the published package:

            * `public` (default): The package can be installed by anyone.
            * `authenticated`: The package can only be installed using an npm authentication token, which provides an additional layer of security.
            * `scoped`: The package is scoped under a given username, meaning it belongs to a specific organization or user and cannot be confused with other packages of the same name.

            So, the `yarn npm publish --access <access-level>` command publishes an npm package with the specified access level.
        otp: |-
            [AI] `yarn npm publish --otp` is a command used in JavaScript project development with Yarn as the package manager and npm (Node Package Manager) for publishing packages to the npm registry.

            The `publish` command is used to prepare and upload new or updated versions of your local npm package to the npm registry, making it publicly available for other developers to install via `npm install`.

            The `--otp` flag stands for "one-time token password." When publishing a package, you have the option to require an OTP (One-Time Password) for confirmation. This is an additional security measure that can be used to ensure that only you, as the owner of the project, can publish new versions. The OTP is generated and provided by npm upon first use, and must be entered each time a new version is published.

            In summary, `yarn npm publish --otp` publishes a package to the npm registry with an added layer of security through the use of One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for confirmation.
        tag: |-
            [AI] The `yarn publish` command with the `--tag` option is used to publish a new version of an npm (Node Package Manager) package to the npm registry. Here's what each part does:

            * `yarn`: A popular package manager for managing JavaScript projects in Node.js.
            * `publish`: A command provided by Yarn that builds, tests, and publishes a new version of your package to the npm registry if it meets certain criteria (e.g., having valid tests).
            * `--tag <tag-name>`: An optional argument that specifies the tag name for this release. By default, `publish` uses semantic versioning and automatically determines the next version number. However, you can override it with a specific tag name by using `--tag`. This is useful when creating pre-release or beta versions (e.g., `--tag v1.0.0-beta`).
        tolerate-republish: '[AI] `yarn npm publish --tolerate-republish` is a command used in Node.js package development. With this command, you are publishing your package to the npm registry using Yarn as the package manager. The `--tolerate-republish` flag allows you to override the default npm behavior that prevents re-publishing of packages with existing versions. This can be useful when you want to force publish a new version even if there is an identical version already present in the registry. However, be cautious as this may lead to confusion for other developers and potential version mismatches in their projects.'
