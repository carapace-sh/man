documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dart pub downgrade` is a Dart command used to downgrade dependencies listed in a `pubspec.yaml` file to specified versions. It retrieves and installs the required packages from the Dart Package Index, overwriting any existing local copies with the newer ones. To use it, specify the package name and desired version as arguments: `dart pub downgrade <package_name>:<version>`. For example, `dart pub downgrade intl:1.15.0` would downgrade the ''intl'' dependency to version 1.15.0. This command helps maintain a consistent project environment by allowing developers to control specific package versions.'
    flag:
        directory: '[AI] `dart pub downgrade` is a command-line tool in Dart programming language used for managing dependencies of a Dart project. The `--directory` option specifies the directory containing the `pubspec.yaml` file that defines the project''s dependencies. So, `dart pub downgrade --directory <path_to_project_dir>` command downgrades the specified dependency versions mentioned in the `pubspec.yaml` file to their previous versions within the given project directory.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `dart pub downgrade --dry-run` is a command used in Dart programming language for testing a package version downgrade before making actual changes in dependencies. When executed, it simulates the effects of running `dart pub downgrade <package_name>` without modifying the pubspec.yaml file or lock file. This way, you can assess potential impacts on your project before implementing the downgrade in earnest.'
        help: '[AI] `dart pub downgrade` is a command-line tool provided by the Dart package manager, `pub`. It''s used to downgrade specific dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file to previous versions. The `--help` option displays detailed usage information about this command, including examples and available options like specifying which packages to downgrade and the target version.'
        no-offline: '[AI] The `dart pub downgrade` command is used to downgrade dependencies in a Dart project, specifically those listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file. The `--no-offline` flag disables offline mode when running this command. In offline mode, Pub would attempt to use local cached copies of packages instead of downloading them from the internet. By disabling offline mode, `downgrade` will fetch and install the specified package versions directly from their sources.'
        offline: '[AI] `dart pub downgrade --offline` is a command used in Dart programming language for managing dependencies with `pub.dev` package registry. It''s used to downgrade specific packages in your project to previous versions. The `--offline` flag indicates that the operation should be performed offline, meaning no internet connection is required as all necessary data will be taken from the local cache. This can be useful when working offline or having unstable network connections.'
