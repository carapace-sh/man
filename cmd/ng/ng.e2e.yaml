        configuration: '[AI] The `ng e2e --configuration` command is used with Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) to execute end-to-end (E2E) tests for an Angular application, specifying a custom test configuration file. The `--configuration` option allows you to provide the path to a JSON or TypeScript file that contains custom configurations for your E2E testing setup. This can include things like setting up test environments, adding additional capabilities to your webdriver, or configuring reporting options. By default, Angular CLI looks for a `e2e.json` file in the root of your project. If you want to use a custom configuration file, pass its path using this option.'
