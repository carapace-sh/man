    command: '[AI] `dart compile exe` is a command used in Dart programming language to compile Dart scripts into native executable files. It converts Dart code into machine code that can be run directly on various operating systems without needing a Dart Virtual Machine or a web browser. This allows for greater portability and faster execution of Dart applications.'
    flag:
        define: '[AI] `dart compile exe` is a command in Dart programming language used to compile a Dart script into an executable binary file. The `--define` option is an additional argument that allows defining constant symbols before compilation. These symbols can be used as if they were part of the Dart core library, making it easier to write portable code. For instance, you could define a constant like `MY_CONSTANT = true;`, and then use `MY_CONSTANT` throughout your codebase without having to worry about its value changing between different builds or environments.'
        enable-asserts: '[AI] The command `dart compile exe --enable-asserts` is used in Dart programming language to create a standalone executable (EXE) file from a Dart script with assertions enabled. Assertions are checks built into the code that ensure the program''s logic and assumptions hold true, helping developers detect issues during development. The `--enable-asserts` flag instructs the Dart compiler to include assertion checking in the generated executable. This can help catch errors at runtime when deploying the application, even if some assertions may add unnecessary runtime overhead or checks in a production environment.'
        help: '[AI] `dart compile exe --help` is a command used in Dart programming language to generate a standalone executable from a Dart script. The `--help` option is for displaying detailed help information about this specific Dart sub-command. It explains the purpose of the command, the format of its usage, and lists all available options with their descriptions. This command line tool compiles your Dart code into an executable file suitable for running on various platforms without requiring a Dart runtime installation.'
        no-sound-null-safety: |-
            [AI] The command `dart compile exe --no-sound-null-safety` is used in Dart programming language for generating an executable (EXE) file without enabling Null Safety feature during the compilation process.

            Dart's Null Safety is a feature introduced to prevent null references at compile time. By default, Dart projects are configured with this option enabled. However, when using older Dart libraries or working on specific use cases where disabling this feature might be necessary, the `--no-sound-null-safety` flag can be passed during compilation to ignore Null Safety checks. This flag allows for backward compatibility and flexibility in development but may introduce potential runtime errors if null values are not handled properly.
        output: '[AI] The `dart compile exe --output` command is used in Dart programming language to compile a Dart script into an executable (Portable Executable or EXE) file for running on Windows platforms. The `--output` option specifies the name and location of the output EXE file. In summary, it converts a Dart script into a standalone application that can be run without requiring a Dart Virtual Machine (VM) or IDE to be installed.'
        packages: '[AI] `dart compile exe --packages` is a command used in Dart programming language to build a standalone executable (EXE) from a Dart application. The `--packages` option tells the Dart compiler to include all required packages and their dependencies during the build process, ensuring that the generated executable can run independently. This command compiles the source code into machine code, creating an executable file that can be run on Windows or other systems that support the Dart runtime without requiring an IDE or additional setup beyond what''s included in the generated package.'
        save-debugging-info: '[AI] The `dart compile exe` command is used in Dart programming language to compile a Dart script into an executable (.exe) file for Windows platform. The `--save-debugging-info` option is an additional flag passed with this command. This flag instructs the Dart compiler to include debugging information while creating the executable. This debugging information can be used by debuggers, such as Dart''s built-in `dart:debugger`, or external debugging tools like Visual Studio Code''s Debugger for Dart, to help developers inspect and modify variables, step through code execution, and identify issues while the application is running.'
        sound-null-safety: '[AI] `dart compile exe` is a command used in Dart programming language to compile a Dart script into an executable (portable) binary file. The `--sound-null-safety` flag enables null safety mode during the compilation process. This means that Dart''s static analyzer checks for potential null errors at compile time, ensuring that references to nullable values are either explicitly checked or implicitly non-nullable. This helps prevent runtime errors related to null values in the code.'
        verbosity: '[AI] The `dart compile exe --verbosity` command is used in Dart programming language to compile a Dart script into an executable (EXE) file with increased output detail or verbosity. This means that the compilation process will print more information about what it''s doing at each stage, making it easier to diagnose potential issues during the build process.'
