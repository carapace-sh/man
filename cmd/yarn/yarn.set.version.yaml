description: Lock the Yarn version used by the project
flags:
    --only-if-needed: Only lock the Yarn version if it isn't already locked
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `yarn set version` is a Yarn package manager command used to set or lock a specific version for one or multiple packages mentioned in your project''s `package.json` or `yarn.lock` file. This can be helpful when you want to ensure consistent dependencies across team members, different environments, or for testing purposes. By executing this command followed by the package name and desired version number, Yarn will update the affected files accordingly.'
    flag:
        only-if-needed: '[AI] The `yarn set version --only-if-needed` command in Yarn is used to set a specific version for a package in the `package.json` file, but only if that version is not already installed or specified. This means that if the requested package version is already present in the project''s dependency tree, no action will be taken. If, however, the desired version differs from what''s currently being used, Yarn will update the package to the new version. This can help ensure consistency and control over installed packages in your project.'
