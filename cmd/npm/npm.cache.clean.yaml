documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm cache clean` command is used to clear the local npm cache in Node.js. It removes all cached packages and their corresponding metadata, forcing npm to redownload them the next time they are installed using `npm install`. This can be useful when experiencing issues with corrupted or outdated cached packages. To run this command, open a terminal or command prompt and type `npm cache clean` followed by pressing enter.'
