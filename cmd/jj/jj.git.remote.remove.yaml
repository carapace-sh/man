        [AI] The `jj` command is not a Git command by itself. However, there's a common typo where people might mean to use the `git` command `jg it remote remove`. Here's what that does:

        `git remote remove` is a Git command used to remove an existing remote repository from your local Git configuration. When you run this command followed by the name of the remote (usually denoted as a shorthand like `origin`), Git will delete the URL for that remote, effectively disconnecting your local repository from it. This can be useful if you want to switch to a different remote or if you've accidentally pushed to the wrong repository.
