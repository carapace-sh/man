documentation:
    command: '[AI] "Dagger functions" is a concept in Dagger, a dependency injection framework for Java and Android. It allows defining methods that automatically create and manage dependencies as singletons or subcomponents within your Dagger graph. Instead of manually defining nodes and injecting them with @Inject, you define methods annotated with @Function annotation in your interfaces or classes. These functions return the required dependency instances which can be later injected into other components or classes. This approach simplifies the codebase by encapsulating complex dependency creation logic within Dagger itself.'
