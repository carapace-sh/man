documentation:
    command: '[AI] `glab alias set` is a GitLab CLI command used to create or update aliases for Git commands. An alias is a shorthand name for a Git command or a series of commands. The `set` sub-command allows you to define, modify, or delete these aliases for easier usage in your Git workflows. For example, `glab alias set push p` sets an alias named ''push'' for the ''git push'' command.'
    flag:
        shell: '[AI] `glab alias set --shell` is a command used with the GitLab CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, `glab`. This command sets or updates an alias for Git commands with a specific shell configuration. For example, you may want to set up an alias like `git push origin master --shell-quote prefer` to use shell quotes when pushing to the origin master branch. This can help prevent issues with spaces in file paths. The `--shell` option specifies the type of shell configuration (e.g., Bash, Zsh, etc.) for the alias.'
