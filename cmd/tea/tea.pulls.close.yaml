documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "tea pulls close" is not a standard computer or programming term. It seems to be a made-up phrase without clear meaning, possibly related to a role-playing game or a fictional universe with its own unique language and rules. Without further context, it''s impossible to explain what this command does or how it should be executed.'
    flag:
        login: '[AI] The `--login` flag in the command `tea pull close --login` is used with the `teaproxy` tool in Kubernetes to create a new TLS-encrypted transport socket for remote access to the Kubernetes cluster using SSH keys for authentication. In simpler terms, it sets up a secure connection to the Kubernetes cluster by establishing an encrypted tunnel and allowing you to authenticate with your SSH keys.'
        output: '[AI] The `--output` flag in the `tea` command (a popular CLI tool for handling YAML files) specifies the output file where the result of a tea command will be saved. For instance, when using the `tea merge` or `tea format` commands to combine or format YAML files respectively, you can use the `--output` flag followed by the desired output file name to save the results there instead of printing them to the console. So, the command `tea format input.yaml --output output.yaml` formats the content of `input.yaml` and saves the result in `output.yaml`.'
        remote: '[AI] The `--remote "tee pulls close"` flag is used with Git''s `fetch` or `pull` commands to tell Git that there is a remote repository called "tee" and it has branches that should be fetched or pulled into the local repository. The `"pulls close"` part likely refers to the strategy for merging or integrating the fetched branches with the current local branches, suggesting it may prioritize merging branches that are closely related.'
        repo: '[AI] The command `git pull <repository>` is used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local Git repository. The prefix "tea pulls" before it seems unrelated and could be just a naming convention for the command in a script or alias. The "--repo" option specifies the URL of the remote repository to pull from, without needing to specify the name of the remote branch or the fetch-before-pull behavior. So, "tea pulls close --repo <URL>" would be equivalent to running `git pull <URL>`.'
