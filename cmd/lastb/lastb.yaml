description: Show a listing of last logged in users
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `lastb` command is a Linux utility used to display the last successful login records for users on the system. It shows the username, the terminal or IP address from which they logged in, and the login time. This information is retrieved from the /var/log/wtmp or /var/run/utmp files, depending on the file system setup. Unlike `last`, which displays all login records including failed attempts, `lastb` only shows successful logins.'
