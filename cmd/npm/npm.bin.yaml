documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm bin` command is a shorthand for accessing the global `node_modules/.bin` directory in Node.js. This directory contains scripts installed as dependencies and made globally available using npm (Node Package Manager). Running `npm bin` by itself has no effect, but you can use it followed by a script name to execute that script directly from your terminal or command prompt. For example: `npm bin my-global-script`.'
    flag:
        global: '[AI] `npm bin --global` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). This command installs packages globally, meaning they are installed for all projects and users on a system rather than just the current project. The `--global` flag tells npm to install packages in the user''s global packaging directory instead of the local one. This allows you to use global node modules, such as CLI tools like Create React App or Express, from anywhere in your terminal without needing to install them locally for each project.'
