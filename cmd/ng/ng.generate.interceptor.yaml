    --project=: The name of the project.
    --skip-tests: Do not create "spec.ts" test files for the new interceptor.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `ng generate interceptor` command is used to create a new Angular HTTP interceptor in your Angular project. An interceptor is a service that can modify the outgoing or incoming HTTP requests/responses in your application. When you run this command, Angular CLI generates a new interceptor service and registration in `app.module.ts`. You can then write custom logic in this service to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests/responses based on your specific requirements.'
    flag:
        flat: |-
            [AI] `ng generate interceptor --flat` is a command used in Angular for generating an Interceptor with the `--flat` option included. An Interceptor is a type of Angular HttpHandler that can be used to intercept and modify HTTP requests or responses before they are handled by the core application.

            The `--flat` option tells Angular's CLI (Command Line Interface) to create a single flat file for the Interceptor, instead of creating multiple files for the Interceptor class, service decorator, and provider configuration. This can be useful when developing smaller Interceptors or when working with limited project directories.
        project: '[AI] `ng generate interceptor` is a command used with Angular CLI (Angular Command Line Interface) to create a new interceptor. An interceptor is a service that can be used to intercept HTTP requests and responses in Angular applications. The `--project` flag specifies the name of the existing Angular project where you want to generate the interceptor. It ensures that the new file will be created in the correct location within your project''s source tree.'
        skip-tests: '[AI] `ng generate interceptor --skip-tests` is a command used in Angular applications with the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface). This command generates a new interceptor, which is a type of Angular HttpInterceptor that can modify or transform outgoing or incoming HTTP requests and responses. The `--skip-tests` flag is an option that skips the creation of test files for the newly generated interceptor. If you don''t want to write tests for your interceptor at that moment, using this command helps to save time and simplify the generation process.'
