    command: '[AI] The `terramate experimental partial-eval` command is a feature in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. This command enables the experimental use of Partial Evaluation Expressions (PXE) in Terraform configuration files. PXE allows the evaluation of expressions in Terraform configurations at compile time rather than runtime, potentially improving performance and reducing errors caused by dynamic data. However, it''s important to note that this feature is considered experimental and may have limitations or compatibility issues with some resources or providers. Always use caution when experimenting with new features, ensure you understand the potential risks and benefits, and keep your Terraform configurations backed up before trying anything new.'

            [AI] The `terramate experimental partial-eval --global` command is related to Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool by Hashicorp. This specific command is used to invoke the experimental `partial-eval` feature with the global option.

            The `partial-eval` feature in Terraform allows for the evaluation of a partial configuration file, which can be shared across multiple modules or workspaces without replicating the entire configuration. By using this feature with the `--global` flag, it indicates that the partial configuration file is globally available and can be used by all the workspaces or module instances in a given Terraform configuration.

            The overall goal of using this command is to improve the organization, modularity, and reusability of Terraform configurations by allowing for the sharing of common configuration components across multiple deployments.
