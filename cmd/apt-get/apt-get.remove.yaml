description: remove is identical to install except that packages are removed
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `apt-get remove` is a command used in Debian-based Linux distributions for removing software packages and their dependencies from the system. When you run this command followed by the package name, apt-get will first attempt to configure the package to be removed, then remove it and finally purge its configuration files. This means that after removal, the package will no longer be installed, but its dependencies (if any) may still remain on the system unless explicitly removed as well.'
