flags:
    --format=: 'Format output using a custom template:'

    -q, --quiet: Only display task IDs
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker stack ps` is a command used in Docker Swarm mode to list the running services and replicas for a given stack, which is a collection of related containers or microservices. The output displays the service name, ID, status (running or error), desired replica count, current replica count, and other relevant information. This command helps users manage their Docker applications at scale by providing an overview of the services'' current state in their Swarm cluster.'
    flag:
        filter: '[AI] `docker stack ps --filter` is a command used in Docker Swarm to list currently running tasks in a stack. The `--filter` option allows you to filter the output based on specific criteria. For example, you can use it to display only tasks with a specific label or status (running, paused, etc.). The filter syntax is `key=value`, and you can chain multiple filters using the `and` or `or` operators.'
        format: '[AI] `docker stack ps --format` is a command used in Docker Swarm to list currently running services and their associated replicas, along with some additional metadata. The `--format` option allows customizing the output format using the Go template syntax. For example, you might use `--format ''{{.ID}}: {{.Status}}''` to display the service ID followed by its status. This can be useful for automating or filtering the output based on specific criteria.'
        no-resolve: '[AI] `docker stack ps --no-resolve` is a command used in Docker Swarm to list the running services and their replicas under a specified stack without resolving them to their node addresses or IPs. It simply displays the service name, ID, and status, while omitting the nodes they are currently deployed on.'
        no-trunc: '[AI] `docker stack ps --no-trunc` is a command used in Docker Swarm to list the running tasks under a specified stack. The `--no-trunc` flag is optional and if used, it prevents the output from being truncated and displays the full length of each container name and service name, without abbreviation or ellipsis.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `docker stack ps --quiet` command is used to display the running services and their instances in a Docker Swarm cluster in a minimal output format. The `--quiet` flag reduces the output to just the essential information, which includes the service name, instance ID, and status (running or failed). This command helps in automating scripts that require programmatic access to this information without cluttering the terminal with unnecessary details.'
