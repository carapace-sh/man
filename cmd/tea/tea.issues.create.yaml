documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea issues create` command is used to create a new issue in the TEA (Telescope Event Admin) system. It requires providing necessary details such as title, description, priority level, and sometimes other metadata for the new issue. Once submitted, the issue will be added to the TEA system''s issue tracker for further review and resolution.'
    flag:
        assignees: '[AI] The `--assignees` option in the Jira command `tea issues create` is used to specify one or more users to be assigned as responsible for a new issue when it''s being created. This helps ensure that the correct team member is handling the task from the start, improving productivity and accountability within your project.'
        deadline: '[AI] The `--deadline` flag in the `tea issues create` command is used to specify a due date for an issue when creating it with the Tea (Terminal-based EasyAdmin) CLI tool. This helps team members prioritize and manage their work based on deadlines. The format of the due date argument is typically "YYYY-MM-DD" or "N days from now". For example, `--deadline 2023-12-31` or `--deadline 5d`.'
        description: '[AI] The `--description` option in the `tea issues create` command is used to provide a brief explanation or summary of the issue being reported when creating a new ticket or problem record in Teasource, a tool for managing software development projects using the TEA (Test, Explore, and Act) methodology. This description helps team members understand the nature and context of the issue for effective collaboration and resolution.'
        labels: '[AI] The `--labels` option in the `tea issues create` command is used to assign labels to a new issue in Tea, a DevOps platform for continuous integration and delivery. Labels help categorize and filter issues based on specific criteria such as component, priority, or status. By providing one or more labels as arguments, you can set them for the new issue during its creation. This allows teams to easily identify and manage related issues within Tea''s issue tracking system.'
        login: '[AI] The `--login` flag used with the `tea issues create` command in the Tea CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for GitHub is related to creating a new issue with authenticated authentication. When this flag is provided, the command creates an issue and logs you into your GitHub account automatically using the stored SSH key or personal access token. This streamlines the process of creating issues on a specific repository without having to manually log in each time.'
        milestone: '[AI] The `--milestone` option in the `tea issues create` command is used to set or update the milestone for a new or existing issue in the Tea project management tool. When creating a new issue, you can specify the milestone at the time of creation. When updating an existing issue, you can use this option to move the issue to a different milestone. The milestone represents a specific goal or stage in a project and helps in organizing and tracking the progress of work.'
        referenced-version: '[AI] The `--referenced-version` option in the `tea issues create` command is used when creating a new issue in TEA (Test Automation Framework for Apache OpenOffice) to specify the version of the referenced library or project that the issue is related to. This helps ensure that developers working on the issue are aware of which version of the codebase they should focus on. The option takes a semantic version number as its argument, such as `1.2.3`.'
        remote: '[AI] The `--remote` option in the `tea issues create` command is used to specify a remote Git repository URL when creating a new issue in Tea, a lightweight CLI tool for GitHub and GitLab. The basic syntax is `tea issues create <title> --remote=<repository-url> [--body="<description>"]`. It allows users to create an issue directly from the command line without having to visit the web interface of their Git hosting service.'
        repo: '[AI] The `--create` option in the Git command `git clone --depth 1 --branch <branch> --single-branch <repository> create <new-project-directory>` with the suffix `--repo` is used to create a new repository based on an existing one, instead of cloning an existing repository. The `--repo` part refers to creating a new Git repository rather than just downloading an existing one. In summary, it creates a new Git repository based on the specified existing repository.'
        title: '[AI] The `--title` option in the "tea issues create" command is used to specify a title or summary for a new issue when creating it using the GitHub Tea CLI tool. It helps provide a clear and concise description of what the issue is about, making it easier for team members to understand and prioritize the work that needs to be done.'
