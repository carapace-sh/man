documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a Git command that shows the difference between two sets of commits in a patch format. It takes two commit ranges as arguments and outputs the differences between each pair of committed files. This command can be useful for understanding the changes introduced between specific points in a project''s history.'
    flag:
        "0": '[AI] `git range-diff -0` is a Git command used to show a raw, unified diff between two commits without any Git-specific metadata or formatting. The `-0` option tells Git to output the diff in raw format, which is a sequence of additions and deletions represented as ''+'' and ''-'' symbols respectively. This command is often used when you want to examine the changes at a low level, for example, to feed the diff into another script or tool for further processing.'
        O: '[AI] `git range-diff -O` is a Git command used to generate a patch file or output the difference between two commits in a format optimized for a Merge tool or a diff tool, such as Beyond Compare or Meld. The `-O` option tells Git to produce an output that can be easily parsed by these tools. It''s often used when you want to compare and merge changes from different branches in a visual way.'
        R: '[AI] `git range-diff -R` is a Git command that generates a patch series, also known as a diff in Git terminology, for all the differences between two branches or commit ranges. The `-R` option stands for "recursive" and tells Git to apply this command recursively to subdirectories. This means that any changes within subdirectories will also be included in the generated patch series. The result is a set of separate patches, each representing the difference between two commits or branches, making it easier to review and apply specific changes across multiple levels of your project''s directory structure.'
        S: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a Git command used to show the difference between two commits or ranges of commits in a more detailed way than regular `git diff`. The `-S` option specifically focuses on showing only the hunks (sections) of added or deleted files. In other words, it provides a summary view of which files were modified and what exactly was added or removed within those files between the given commit range.'
        abbrev: '[AI] `git range-diff --abbrev` is a command used in Git to display a compact, abbreviated difference between two commits or branches. The `--abbrev` option makes Git output the commit hashes as shortened strings (instead of full SHA-1 hash) and provides a summary of changes at each file level without showing the entire diff context. This command is often used to quickly compare the changes introduced by multiple commits in a clear and concise way.'
        anchored: '[AI] `git range-diff --anchored` is a Git command that generates a diff (difference) output between two commits, with an anchored common base. The common base commit serves as a reference point for the differences between the two commits. This option ensures that the common base is always displayed in the middle of the diff output and can help to provide better context when comparing larger sets of changes.'
        base: '[AI] `git range-diff --base` is a Git command used to show the difference between two commits or branches, with the focus on the base commit (usually the common ancestor). This means it shows the differences introduced in each commit that led to the current state of the branch or set of commits. It provides a side-by-side comparison, making it easier to understand the changes made at each step in the commit history.'
        binary: '[AI] `git range-diff --binary` is a Git command used to generate a binary diff between two commits or tree objects. This type of diff is useful when dealing with binary files, as it preserves the exact binary data and allows for easy comparison in tools that support binary diffs, such as visual merging tools or patch format `--patch`. The output is typically saved into a file with a `.diffbinary` extension.'
        break-rewrites: '[AI] `git range-diff --break-rewrites` is a Git command used to show a detailed difference between two branches or commits, with an emphasis on handling rewritable history. When `--break-rewrites` is specified, Git will attempt to show the differences even if one side of the comparison has been rewritten with `git rebase`, `git merge`, or similar commands. This can result in conflicts or "diff hunks" that need to be manually resolved. It''s useful when working on complex branches where history modifications are common, and you want to understand the changes at a granular level.'
        cached: '[AI] `git range-diff --cached` is a Git command used to show the difference between two commits in the index (staging area) without taking the working directory into account. It generates a patch for each file showing the changes that would be made if those indexed changes were committed. This command does not affect the current working directory and is often used for reviewing changes before creating a new commit.'
        check: '[AI] `git range-diff --check` is a Git command used to perform a check on the differences between two branches or commits without actually displaying the changes. It''s primarily intended for use in scripts or automated workflows, where you want to verify that there are no conflicts before merging or applying changes. The command returns an exit status indicating whether the differences were clean (0) or contained merge conflicts (1).'
        color: '[AI] `git range-diff --color` is a Git command used to display a difference between two commits or ranges of commits in a colorized format. It shows the changes made in each file with different colors representing additions (green), deletions (red), and modifications (white). This makes it easier to visually identify the differences between the revisions.'
        color-moved: '[AI] `git range-diff --color-moved` is a Git command that generates a diff output between two commits with an emphasis on moved lines. The `--color-moved` option causes Git to highlight moved lines in color, making it easier to identify which lines have been moved between the two revisions. This command is particularly useful when working with large codebases or dealing with complex refactoring changes.'
        color-moved-ws: '[AI] `git range-diff --color-moved-ws` is a Git command that generates a difference output between two commits with enhanced colorization for moved lines and whitespace changes. It provides a clearer view of the differences between the commits, making it easier to identify where lines have been added, removed, or modified, as well as any whitespace changes like indentation adjustments.'
        color-words: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a command used to show the difference between two commits or branches in Git. The `--color-words` option enables Git to highlight specific words that have been added, modified, or deleted in the output of the command. This makes it easier for users to quickly identify changes at a word level instead of just looking at lines. The colors used are typically red for deletions, green for additions, and normal text for modifications.'
        compact-summary: '[AI] `git range-diff --compact-summary` is a Git command that displays a compact summary of the differences between two commit ranges in a single-line format. Each line represents a commit and shows the author, commit message hash, and the number of added and deleted lines for each file changed in that commit. This command is often used to quickly compare the changes made across multiple commits in a concise way.'
        creation-factor: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a command used to show the difference between two commits in Git. The `--creation-factor` option affects how empty files are handled during the comparison. By default, Git considers an empty file as different whenever it appears or disappears in the commit history. However, with `--creation-factor`, Git will only consider an empty file as a change if its creation factor (the number of commits that introduce or remove the file) is greater than one. This can be useful when dealing with large projects where many files are added and removed frequently.'
        cumulative: '[AI] `git range-diff --cumulative` is a Git command that generates a diff output showing the cumulative changes between two branches or commits. The `--cumulative` option merges adjacent differences into a single hunk, displaying the net effect of all the changes in a single patch. This is useful for understanding the overall difference between the source and destination commits or branches. Each line in the output represents a change that was introduced at some commit along the specified range.'
        diff-algorithm: |-
            [AI] `git range-diff` is a Git command used to show the difference between two branches or commits in a more detailed way than regular `git diff`. The `--diff-algorithm` option allows you to specify the difference algorithm to use for generating the patch.

            There are three available algorithms:
            1. `myers` (default): This is Git's default and most versatile algorithm, useful for most differences. It handles renames, deletions, and insertions effectively.
            2. `patch`: This algorithm generates the patches in a format that can be applied using `git apply`. It's less powerful than the myers algorithm but simpler to use when dealing with individual files.
            3. `histogram`: This algorithm displays differences as a histogram, which is useful for visualizing large numbers of changes in a concise way. It doesn't handle binary files and renames, making it less suitable for complex differences.

            In summary, the `--diff-algorithm` option in `git range-diff` allows you to choose the difference algorithm used when displaying differences between two branches or commits. Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, so selecting the right one depends on the specific use case.
        diff-filter: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a Git command used to show the difference between two commits or branches in a more detailed way than regular `git diff`. The `--diff-filter` option allows filtering which types of differences are shown. For example, `--diff-filter=d` shows only deleted files, `--diff-filter=A` shows added and deleted files, and `--diff-filter=M` shows modified files. By providing multiple filters separated by commas, you can control what types of changes will be displayed.'
        dirstat: '[AI] `git range-diff --dirstat` is a Git command that generates a summary statistics output for each file in a given commit range. It shows the number of added, modified, and deleted files, as well as the percentage of each type in the overall change set. The output is displayed in tabular format with columns for the filepath, total changes, and the percentage of additions, deletions, and modifications. This command is useful when you want to get a high-level overview of what changed between two commits or branches in terms of files and their contents.'
        dirstat-by-file: '[AI] `git range-diff --dirstat-by-file` is a Git command that generates a diffstat-style output for a given file or set of files between two commits, displaying the number of added and deleted lines for each file. The `--dirstat-by-file` option makes git show the statistics per file instead of the default global statistics.'
        dst-prefix: '[AI] `git range-diff --dst-prefix` is a Git command used to show the difference between two branches or commit ranges in a patch format, with an additional prefix added to the destination files'' names in the diff output. The `--dst-prefix` option allows you to specify a custom prefix for these file names. This can be useful when comparing large codebases where having clear and consistent filenames in the diff output is important.'
        exit-code: '[AI] `git range-diff --exit-code` is a Git command used to display a unified diff between two commits or ranges in three files: the difference between their differences (a left-right diff), the difference between each commit and a common base (a regular diff), and a merge file if applicable. The `--exit-code` option makes Git return an exit code indicating whether the diff is a merge conflict (non-zero) or not (zero). This can be used in scripts to automatically handle merge conflicts.'
        ext-diff: '[AI] `git range-diff --ext-diff` is a Git command used to display a differ between two commits or branches in an external format, such as a text file or a visual diff tool, instead of the default patch format. The `--ext-diff` option tells Git to use an external diff driver to generate the difference output. This can be useful when dealing with large or complex differences, or when working with third-party tools for merging or visualizing changes.'
        find-copies: '[AI] `git range-diff --find-copies` is a Git command that shows the differences between two revisions with special markers indicating where files have been copied, moved, or deleted and where new copies have appeared in the changed files. It''s an extended version of the regular `git diff` command, designed to provide more context about file changes across multiple commits. This is particularly useful when working on large projects with complex file manipulations.'
        find-copies-harder: '[AI] `git range-diff --find-copies-harder` is a Git command that generates a more detailed and accurate diff between two commits or branches. The `--find-copies-harder` option is specifically designed to help identify file copies and renames within the diff output. When a file is modified, moved, or copied in Git, it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish these actions just by looking at the standard diff output. However, the `--find-copies-harder` option improves the accuracy of the diff by making an extra effort to identify the relationship between files with similar content across multiple commits or branches. This can be particularly useful when working on large projects or merging complex changes.'
        find-object: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a Git command used to show the difference between two revisions or a range of commits in a more detailed way than the regular `git diff`. The `--find-object` option is an additional argument for this command. It instructs Git to resolve object names (commits, trees, and blobs) mentioned in the diff output by following the object graph up to the point where they can be found in the local repository or the specified ref. This helps ensure that the comparison is based on the exact committed data rather than potentially stale cached data. In summary, `git range-diff --find-object` provides a more precise and reliable way of comparing revisions by ensuring the correct object versions are used for the comparison.'
        find-renames: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a Git command that compares the differences between two commits or ranges in the repository. The `--find-renames` option is used to identify renamed files and display the old and new names, as well as the renames themselves, in the output. It highlights the file renames with an "@@" prefix followed by the old and new paths. This can be useful when tracking down file name changes during a code review or merge process.'
        full-index: '[AI] `git range-diff --full-index` is a Git command used to generate a detailed difference report between two specific commits in a repository. The `--full-index` option expands the output to include the full diffstat and index data for each file in the commit, in addition to the normal diff hunks. This can be useful when analyzing complex changes or merging branches. Each entry consists of the file name, number of added and deleted lines, and a hash representing the blob object in the index.'
        function-context: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a Git command used to generate a diff between two commits or branches with more context than what''s shown in a regular `git diff`. The `--function-context` option, when used with `git range-diff`, includes the context of the functions surrounding the changes, making it suitable for understanding the impact of code changes on function definitions and their usage across multiple files. It provides a more comprehensive view of the differences between the commits or branches in terms of function context.'
        histogram: '[AI] `git range-diff --histogram` is a Git command used to generate a histogram representation of the differences between two branches or commits. The histogram shows the number of added and deleted lines for each commit in the given range, helping visualize the size and impact of individual commits on the difference between the two repositories or branches. It''s an efficient way to compare the code changes at a glance.'
        ignore-all-space: '[AI] `git range-diff --ignore-all-space` is a Git command used to show the difference between two branches or commit ranges in a more readable format, specifically ignoring all whitespace differences. This can be helpful when comparing code changes where the focus is on the logic and structure of the code rather than trivial whitespace variations. The `--ignore-all-space` option instructs Git to hide differences caused by added or removed trailing spaces, indentation, and other forms of whitespace. This makes it easier to visualize the actual changes made to the code.'
        ignore-blank-lines: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a Git command used to show the difference between two commits or ranges of commits in a more detailed way than the regular `git diff`. The `--ignore-blank-lines` option instructs Git to ignore differences related to blank lines when displaying the difference output. This can be useful when dealing with files containing large amounts of blank lines, such as configuration files or markdown documents, to make the output more readable and focused on the actual changes made to the content.'
        ignore-cr-at-eol: '[AI] `git range-diff --ignore-cr-at-eol` is a Git command used to show the difference between two commits or ranges in a text format. The `--ignore-cr-at-eol` option is an argument that instructs Git to ignore carriage returns at the end of lines when displaying the differences. This is particularly useful when dealing with files on different operating systems, as line endings can be represented differently (LF vs CRLF). By ignoring these differences, the focus remains on the actual changes made between the commits.'
        ignore-space-at-eol: '[AI] `git range-diff --ignore-space-at-eol` is a Git command used to show a diff between two commit ranges in a text format, with a focus on ignoring differences caused by whitespace at the end of lines (EOL - End Of Line). By using this option, Git will consider two lines identical if they only differ by one or more trailing white spaces. This can be helpful when you want to compare changes that don''t involve formatting and focus on the underlying code modifications.'
        ignore-space-change: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a command in Git used to show the differences between two commits or branches. The `--ignore-space-change` option tells Git to ignore changes that only add or remove whitespace, such as indentation or line breaks, when comparing files. This can be useful when you want to focus on textual changes rather than formatting differences.'
        ignore-submodules: '[AI] `git range-diff --ignore-submodules` is a Git command used to display a diff between two commits or ranges in a repository, with subdirectories treated as if they didn''t contain any inner repository (i.e., Git submodules). In other words, it ignores the existence and changes of submodules while generating the diff output. This can be useful when you want to focus on the differences between the parent directories without taking submodules into account.'
        indent-heuristic: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a command used to show the difference between two commits in a Git repository. The option `--indent-heuristic` is used to automatically adjust the indentation of hunks (a contiguous chunk of code that has been changed) in the output diff for a better visual representation. It attempts to determine the correct number of spaces or tabs for each hunk based on the surrounding context, making it easier to review and apply the changes.'
        inter-hunk-context: |-
            [AI] `git range-diff` is a command used to generate a diff between two commits or ranges in Git. The `--inter-hunk-context` option modifies the output of this command.

            With `--inter-hunk-context`, Git includes additional context lines between hunks (chunks of changes). Specifically, it shows context from the previous and next hunk contexts around the change, making it easier to understand the context of the changes in larger files or when dealing with complex merge conflicts.

            This option provides more information by showing a wider context around each hunk, helping you better understand how different changes are related and affecting the codebase.
        irreversible-delete: '[AI] `git range-diff --irreversible-delete` is a Git command used to show a unidirectional difference between two commits or branches. This means it will only show the deleted lines or files that have been permanently removed from the second commit and not present in the first one. The "--irreversible-delete" option emphasizes this by highlighting the deletions with a distinctive symbol, making it easier to identify irreversible changes between the two revisions.'
        ita-invisible-in-index: '[AI] `git range-diff --ita-invisible-in-index` is a command used in Git to display a range diff between two commits with invisible changes marked in the index, but not in the text output. This means that any changes marked as "ours" or "theirs" during a merge conflict, but later resolved in the index without modifying the working files, will be indicated only by special characters in the index file (not shown in the text diff). This can be useful when you want to see the exact changes that were resolved in the index without cluttering the diff output with conflicts that have already been resolved.'
        l: '[AI] `git range-diff -l` is a Git command used to show a unified diff between two commits or branches in a linear format. The `-l` option stands for "show only differences between files," displaying each difference as a single line with the changed lines highlighted. This command is useful for quickly viewing changes made between two specific points in a repository.'
        line-prefix: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a Git command used to show the difference between two commits or branches in a more detailed way than regular `git diff`. The `--line-prefix` option adds a prefix before each hunk, which indicates the context of the changed lines. This can be helpful when dealing with large or complex differences and makes it easier to understand where each change occurred within the file.'
        minimal: '[AI] `git range-diff --minimal` is a Git command used to show a minimal difference between two commits or branches. It produces output in a format that only shows the differences between the files affected by each commit, with no extraneous context or merge information. This makes it useful for quickly reviewing the specific changes made between two revisions. The `--minimal` option instructs Git to use as little whitespace as possible while preserving the semantic integrity of the diff.'
        name-only: '[AI] `git range-diff --name-only` is a Git command that generates a list of file names affected by a given commit range. The `--name-only` option requests that only the file names be printed, without any other information such as the changes made to each file. It''s useful for quickly identifying which files have been modified in a specific range of commits.'
        name-status: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a Git command used to show the difference between two commits or branches in a more detailed way than regular `git diff`. The `--name-status` option adds output that shows the new, modified, and deleted files along with the hunks (parts) of the differences. This can be useful for understanding which files have been changed and how between the specified Git objects.'
        no-color: '[AI] `git range-diff --no-color` is a Git command used to show the differences between two commit ranges in a plain text format without any colorization. The `--no-color` option disables the use of colors to distinguish different types of changes, such as additions, deletions, and modifications. Instead, the command outputs the differences using context lines and simple code labels, making it suitable for scripting or when working with terminals that don''t support colorization.'
        no-color-moved: |-
            [AI] `git range-diff --no-color` is a Git command that displays a unified diff between two commits or branches. The `--no-color` option disables colored output, making it useful for scripts or text-based viewing.

            The `--no-color-moved` flag refines this further by only showing the differences in code changes and not the file renames or moved lines. This can be helpful when you're specifically looking for what was modified in the commits, without being distracted by any file renaming or movement information.
        no-color-moved-ws: '[AI] `git range-diff --no-color` is a Git command used to show the difference between two commit ranges in a text format. The `--no-color` option is used to disable color output. The `--no-color-moved-ws` option further refines this by disabling the colorization of moved lines with whitespace changes, making the output more consistent and easier for scripts to parse.'
        no-dual-color: '[AI] `git range-diff --no-dual-color` is a Git command that displays a unified diff between two commits or branches, without using dual colors for highlighting differences. This means the changes will be shown in plain text, with each hunk (a logical change set) preceded by an @ sign and followed by the added or deleted lines. The --no-dual-color option is used to suppress Git''s default use of colored output, which can be helpful when viewing differences in terminal environments that don''t support color or when preferring a monochrome display.'
        no-ext-diff: '[AI] `git range-diff --no-ext-diff` is a Git command used to show the difference between two commits or a range of commits in text format, without using external diff tools. The `--no-ext-diff` option disables the use of external diff tools and forces Git to show the differences using its internal diff engine instead. This can be useful when the default external tool does not provide the desired output or is not available on the system.'
        no-indent-heuristic: '[AI] `git range-diff --no-indent-heuristic` is a Git command that generates a diff between two commits, with the option `--no-indent-heuristic` disabling Git''s heuristic to automatically remove indentation changes when comparing files. This can be useful when dealing with files where indentation matters, such as code files, and you want to see all changes including indentation adjustments.'
        no-index: '[AI] `git range-diff --no-index` is a Git command used to show the difference between two commits or ranges of commits in the text format, without considering changes to file paths or modes. It''s often used for reviewing and understanding code changes at a high level, focusing on the actual code differences. With `--no-index`, Git does not read from or write to the index, allowing faster execution for large repositories or when comparing commits that don''t involve changes to file paths or modes.'
        no-notes: '[AI] `git range-diff --no-notes` is a Git command used to show the difference between two commits or ranges in a text format, with the notable difference being that it excludes the commit messages (also known as "notes" or "commit messages notes") from the output. This can be useful when you want to focus only on the code changes without the distraction of the commit messages.'
        no-patch: '[AI] `git range-diff --no-patch` is a Git command used to show the differences between two commits or branches in a raw format, without generating a patch file. The `--no-patch` option is used to suppress the output of the patch format and instead display only the commit messages and the difference between their changeset descriptions (i.e., the `REFNAME:` prefixes and the actual differences). This command provides a convenient way to compare commits side by side in text form, which can be useful for understanding the content of the changes without generating or applying patches.'
        no-prefix: '[AI] `git range-diff --no-prefix` is a Git command that shows the difference between two commits in a raw format without any prefixes such as commit messages or author information. It focuses solely on the changes made in the committed code. This command generates a patch file containing only the changed lines and can be used for more detailed comparison or further processing with other tools.'
        no-rename-empty: '[AI] `git range-diff --no-rename-empty` is a Git command that shows a detailed difference between two commits in a text format. The `--no-rename-empty` option disables the emission of empty rename lines in the output when there''s no corresponding change in the files being compared. This can be useful when dealing with large or complex code changes and reducing the noise from empty or irrelevant renames, making it easier to understand the actual differences between commits.'
        no-renames: '[AI] `git range-diff --no-renames` is a Git command that generates a diff between two commits or ranges of commits without showing renamed files as moves. Instead, it displays them as deleted and added files with distinct paths. This can be useful when comparing differences where file renamings are not the focus.'
        notes: '[AI] `git range-diff --notes` is a command used in Git to show the difference between two commits or a range of commits, including the commit messages and author notes associated with each commit. The `--notes` option ensures that any attached notes are also displayed along with the changes. This can be helpful for understanding the context and intent behind the changes made in the commits.'
        numstat: '[AI] `git range-diff --numstat` is a Git command that generates a summarized difference statistics between two commits or branches in a numerical format. Each line of output represents a file and displays the number of added, deleted, and modified lines for each file fragment. The command provides an overview of the changes at a granular level without showing the actual changed lines.'
        ours: '[AI] `git range-diff --ours` is a Git command used to display the differences between the current branch''s working directory files and the index (staging area) for a given range of commits. The `--ours` option makes Git show only the differences that exist in the local working directory, meaning the changes that were not merged with the incoming commits. This command is helpful when you want to compare your local modifications against the changes introduced by a set of commits and decide which ones to keep or discard.'
        output: '[AI] `git range-diff --output` is a Git command used to generate a diff between two commits or branches, but instead of displaying the difference in the terminal, it writes the output to a file with the specified name (omitted in this command for brevity). The resulting file will contain the patch differences, formatted according to the given Git diff format options.'
        output-indicator-context: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a command used to show the difference between two commits or branches in Git. The option `--output-indentifier-context` specifies that for each hunk of changed lines, Git should display the context lines (lines added or deleted) before and after the hunk, indicated with ">" for additions and "<" for deletions. This helps to better understand the changes made between the commits in the given range.'
        output-indicator-new: '[AI] `git range-diff --output-indicator-new` is a Git command used to show a unified diff between two commits or branches with special indicators for added lines in the new revision. The `--output-indicator-new` option enables the display of `>` symbols before each line that''s newly added in the newer revision. This helps visually distinguish new additions from existing changes and deletions, making it easier to understand the differences between the revisions.'
        output-indicator-old: '[AI] `git range-diff --output-indicator-old` is a Git command that generates a diff output between two commit ranges. The `--output-indicator-old` option influences how the output is formatted, specifically by prefixing each hunk (a change set) with an indicator representing the parent of the first commit in the range. This can be helpful for understanding which side of the diff contains the changes when dealing with complex merge conflicts.'
        patch: '[AI] `git range-diff --patch` is a Git command used to generate patch files that show the differences between two commits or branches in a more human-readable format, known as the "patch format." This format includes the header information, such as author name and commit message, and the actual changes represented by the addition (++) and removal (-) symbols. The output is written to standard output or a file if specified with an option, allowing easy review of changes before applying them.'
        patch-with-raw: '[AI] `git range-diff --patch-with-raw` is a Git command used to generate a difference patch between two commits in a raw format, which includes both the header information and the hunk differences as plain text. This can be particularly useful for applying the diff manually or processing it with other tools, such as scripts or text editors, that may not support the standard git format (e.g., `git format-patch`). The range specifies the commits to compare.'
        patch-with-stat: |-
            [AI] `git range-diff --patch-with-stat` is a Git command used to generate a patch output for the differences between two commits or branches, displaying the file statistics alongside the diff patches.

            This command shows both the added and deleted lines for each hunk in the patch, wrapped with `---` for context before and after the changes, as well as the number of additions (+) and deletions (-) at the beginning of each hunk. The output is formatted using the 'patch' format and includes a statistical summary for each file affected by the commits being compared.
        patience: '[AI] `git range-diff --patience` is a Git command that generates a side-by-side diff with merged hunks when comparing the differences between two branches or commits. The `--patience` option arranges the output in a "patch series" format, which groups hunks that share a common context and suppresses hunks that are identical except for whitespace differences. This makes it easier to understand larger or complex changes, as the related modifications are shown together.'
        pickaxe-all: '[AI] `git range-diff --pickaxe-all` is a Git command used to show the differences between two branches or commits in a more condensed format. The `--range-diff` option displays the difference as a series of hunks, while the `--pickaxe-all` option includes a "pick" line for each hunk that can be used with `git apply` to cherry-pick the changes into another branch or commit. This command is particularly useful when reviewing large numbers of commits and wanting to selectively apply specific changes.'
        pickaxe-regex: '[AI] `git range-diff --pickaxe-regex` is a Git command used to show the difference between two commits with a focus on identifying added or deleted lines. The option "--pickaxe-regex" adds the power of regular expressions to filter out specific changes in the output. When used, only the hunks (chunks of code) containing additions or deletions that match the provided regex pattern will be displayed. This command is useful for quickly identifying and comparing changes related to a specific pattern across multiple commits.'
        raw: '[AI] `git range-diff --raw` is a Git command used to generate raw, textual differences between two revisions or a range of revisions in a Git repository. The `--raw` option outputs the differences using the plain text format specified by the "diff.asTextPlugin" configuration setting, making it easier for scripts and tools to parse and process the output.'
        relative,: '[AI] `git range-diff --relative` is a Git command that generates a patch series showing the differences between two commits or branches. The `--relative` option produces output in the "unified diff" format with relative paths, meaning the path prefixes will be relative to the current working directory instead of absolute. This can be useful when reviewing changes in a repository cloned into different directories.'
        rename-empty: |-
            [AI] `git range-diff` is a command used to show the difference between two commits or ranges of commits in Git. The `--rename-empty` option affects how Git handles empty files and renamed files.

            With the `--rename-empty` flag, Git will treat empty files as deleted files and then created anew at their new location (if any) during a rename. This means that when you see an empty file listed during a `git range-diff` with `--rename-empty`, it indicates that the file was indeed empty in the older commit but was later renamed and possibly recreated as a new file in the newer commit.

            This option can be helpful when comparing commits that have deleted and/or renamed files, providing more detailed information about the changes made to the files.
        shortstat: '[AI] `git range-diff --shortstat` is a Git command that generates a summary of changes between two commit ranges in a human-readable and compact format. The `--shortstat` option displays the number of added, deleted, and modified files for each commit in the range. Each line represents a single commit with columns showing: number of added lines, deleted lines, total lines changed, author name, and commit message hash. This command is useful for quickly comparing the statistical differences between commits or branches.'
        src-prefix: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a Git command that shows the difference between two commits or branches in a more detailed way than the standard `git diff`. The `--src-prefix` option specifies a prefix string to be added to the source commit''s lines when displaying the differences. This can be useful for easily identifying which parts of the changes come from which commit. For example, if you have two branches with conflicts and want to see the differences with clear indication of which branch each change belongs to, you could use `git range-diff --src-prefix="BranchA:" -- <branch_a>..<branch_b>`.'
        stat: '[AI] `git range-diff --stat` is a Git command used to generate a statistic output during a diff comparison. It shows the number of added, modified, and deleted files between two commits or branches. The output includes file names with counts of additions (+), deletions (-), and modifications (M). This command helps identify the changes made at a high level before diving into the detailed differences using other Git diff commands.'
        stat-count: '[AI] `git range-diff --stat` is a Git command that generates a diffstat output showing the number of added and deleted lines for each file changed between two commits. The `--stat-count` option further summarizes this output by providing only the total number of additions, deletions, and modifications across all files in the difference.'
        stat-graph-width: '[AI] `git range-diff --stat-graph-width` is a command in Git used to generate a graphical representation of the differences between two commits or branches. The `--stat-graph-WIDTH` option sets the width of the graph in columns. It helps to visually compare the changes made in each file, showing additions (+), deletions (-), and modifications (M) as horizontal bars on the graph. Adjusting the width allows for a clearer view of the changes.'
        stat-name-width: '[AI] `git range-diff --stat` is a command used to show the differences between two commits in Git, with an emphasis on file statistics. The `--stat-name-width` option adjusts the width used for displaying the names of changed files in the statistics output. This can be useful when dealing with long file names that extend beyond the default width and cause the stat output to wrap unnecessarily.'
        stat-width: '[AI] The `git range-diff --stat` command is used to show a diff statistic between two commits or branches in Git. The `--stat-width` option adjusts the width of these statistics to fit within a specific column width. This can be useful when viewing diffs with long filenames or large numbers of changes, as it prevents the output from wrapping unnecessarily and making it harder to read.'
        submodule: '[AI] `git range-diff --submodule` is a Git command used to show the differences between two commits in the history of a repository, specifically for changes made to submodules. Submodules are Git repositories within other Git repositories, allowing you to keep a Git project and its subprojects under separate version control. With `git range-diff --submodule`, you can compare the state of these submodules between any two commits, displaying both the changes to the submodule itself and any changes made in the parent project that affect the submodule. It''s an essential tool for understanding how a submodule evolves over time in relation to its parent repository.'
        summary: '[AI] `git range-diff --summary` is a Git command used to display a summary of differences between two commits or branches. When you run this command with two commit hashes or branch names as arguments, Git will output a list of affected files and the number of added and deleted lines for each file in the difference. This command is often used to quickly review changes before applying them to your working directory or creating a new branch. The output provides an overview of the changes without showing the full diff content, making it easier to assess the impact of the commits.'
        text: '[AI] `git range-diff --text` is a Git command used to show the difference between two commits in text format. This means that instead of displaying the changes visually using a diff tool or by staging and committing the differences, it outputs the difference as plain text in the console. This can be useful for scripts or for viewing differences without opening a graphical diff tool. The `--text` option specifies this output format.'
        textconv: |-
            [AI] `git range-diff` is a Git command used to show the differences between two commits or branches in a more detailed way than regular `git diff`. The `--textconv` option is an additional argument for this command.

            When `--textconv` is specified, Git will apply a text conversion filter on the output of each hunk (changeset). This can be useful when dealing with binary files or specific file formats where raw diffs are not meaningful. For instance, in the case of diffing two SQL scripts, `--textconv` could be used to apply a custom SQL parser that generates human-readable output.

            By default, Git comes with a few built-in text conversion filters like 'patch' and 'porcelain'. Custom filters can also be created and used with `--textconv`. The resulting differences will appear as patch format in the console or merge tool for further review and application to the working directory.
        theirs: '[AI] `git range-diff --theirs` is a Git command used to show the differences between two branches or commits, with the output highlighting changes made in the branch being merged (called "their" branch). The command displays side-by-side differences with the changes from the merged branch on the right and the base branch on the left. This can be useful for reviewing and understanding the modifications made during a merge.'
        u: '[AI] `git range-diff -u` is a Git command that generates unified format difference output between two branches or commits. The `-u` option means "unified" format, which displays the differences with a header indicating the files changed and the added/removed lines highlighted within the context of the surrounding context lines. This command allows visualizing the changes made across multiple commits in a clear and concise way.'
        unified: '[AI] `git range-diff --unified` is a Git command used to show the difference between two branches or commits in a unified format. The unified diff format displays the differences as a series of additions (+) and deletions (-) with context lines before and after each change, making it easier to understand the impact of each modification. This command is particularly useful when you want to compare the changes made between two revisions or branches in detail.'
        word-diff: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a command used to show the differences between two revisions or ranges of commits in Git. The `--word-diff` option, when used with this command, displays the changed words as differing strings instead of the usual context diff. This makes it easier to identify and understand changes that consist mainly of text edits, particularly for large files or complex differences.'
        word-diff-regex: '[AI] `git range-diff` is a command in Git that shows the difference between two commits or ranges of commits. The option `--word-diff-regex` tells Git to perform a word-level diff using a custom regular expression for detecting changed words instead of the default one. This can be useful when dealing with specific formatting or naming conventions in code files, allowing for more precise and fine-grained comparison between commits.'
        ws-error-highlight: '[AI] `git range-diff --ws-error-highlight` is a Git command used to display a diff between two commits or branches with an emphasis on hightlighting merge conflicts or whitespace errors in the text files. The `--ws-error-highlight` option specifically highlights whitespace errors, which are differences that don''t affect meaning but can cause issues when merging files (e.g., trailing spaces, indentation issues). This command is particularly useful when working on large projects with many contributors and frequent merges to ensure that the changes are properly merged without introducing unnecessary errors.'
        z: '[AI] `git range-diff -z` is a Git command used to generate a raw, binary format of a diff between two commits or branches. The `-z` option adds a null character at the end of each line in the output for easier parsing by other tools, such as patch files or scripts. This command does not display differences on the terminal but generates an output that can be processed further.'
