    command: '[AI] `nix` is a powerful and configurable Linux package manager and building system. It manages software dependencies and builds software from source using a declarative approach, ensuring reproducible builds and consistent environments. The `nix` command line interface (CLI) is used to interact with the Nix expression language for defining packages and their dependencies.'
    flag:
        accept-flake-config: |-
            [AI] `nix --accept-flake-config` is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Un*x systems. This option enables Nix to accept a Flake configuration file when installing or building packages.

            A Flake is a Nix expression that allows managing dependencies between projects as well as defining multiple build configurations for the same source code. By providing a Flake config file, users can customize the build process, specify extra dependencies, and define custom configurations for their projects.

            In summary, `nix --accept-flake-config` enables Nix to utilize project-specific configurations defined in a Flake configuration file when performing installations or builds.
        access-tokens: '[AI] The `nix` command-line tool, specifically its subcommand `--access-tokens`, is used to manage access tokens for Nix packages and channels. Access tokens are used for authentication when interacting with remote Nix expression evaluators or other Nix services. With this command, you can create, update, delete, or list your existing access tokens. The output will display details such as the token name, creation date, expiration time (if set), and status (active/inactive). This is essential for managing secure access to external Nix resources.'
        allow-dirty: '[AI] The `--allow-dirty` flag in Nix packaging is used to bypass the build system''s requirement for a pristine, unmodified source tree during the build process. This flag is especially useful when developing new packages or working on package updates where iterative builds are necessary and the source tree needs to be modified between builds. By allowing dirty builds, Nix can continue to build and test changes without starting from a fresh source tree every time. However, it''s important to note that using this flag may increase the risk of inconsistent or broken builds, as unintended modifications might affect the final output. It should be used with caution and only when necessary.'
        allow-import-from-derivation: '[AI] `nix --allow-import-from-derivation` is a command line option used with Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This option allows importing packages directly from Nix derivations instead of the default, which is to import only built-in or locally installed packages. Derivations are Nix expressions that define how to build and package software. With this flag enabled, you can use `import` statements in your configuration files to bring in external derivations, making it easier to manage dependencies and build complex systems.'
        allow-new-privileges: '[AI] The `--allow-new-privileges` flag in Nix packages management system allows a command or a package to request and be granted additional privileges at runtime. This can bypass some of the default security restrictions enforced by Nix, potentially introducing potential security risks if used carelessly. It''s essential to only use this flag when necessary, and with a clear understanding of the implications.'
        allow-symlinked-store: '[AI] The `--allow-symlinked-store` flag in Nix packaging system allows the creation of a symlink in the store (Nix''s package repository) instead of copying files when building and installing packages with hard links or symbolic links in their build outputs. This can save disk space, especially useful for large projects or distributed systems. However, it should be noted that this option may introduce potential issues related to file ownership, permissions, or stability of the linked data, so it''s essential to use it with caution and ensure proper setup and testing.'
        allow-unsafe-native-code-during-evaluation: '[AI] The `--allow-unsafe-native-code-during-evaluation` flag in Nix is used to permit the evaluation of expressions containing unsafe native code, which is code written in low-level languages like C or assembly that can potentially introduce security vulnerabilities. By default, Nix does not allow such code for safety reasons. However, when this flag is passed during evaluation, Nix relaxes this restriction and allows the unsafe native code to be executed. It''s important to note that using this flag should only be done with caution and proper understanding of the risks involved.'
        allowed-impure-host-deps: '[AI] The `--allowed-impure-host-deps` flag in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems, permits the installation of packages with impure dependencies hosted outside the Nix store. Impure dependencies are those that have build-time dependencies or other non-essential components that are not managed by Nix. By default, Nix only allows dependencies to be sourced from the Nix store itself, but this flag relaxes that restriction for specified hosts, allowing local or external packages to be used as dependencies. It''s important to note that using this flag may introduce security risks and potential versioning issues, so its use should be carefully considered and monitored.'
        allowed-uris: '[AI] `nix --allowed-uris` is a command-line option for Nix Package Manager, which specifies a list of allowed URI schemes or hosts from which Nix can fetch packages and their dependencies. The option enhances security by restricting the sources of software installation. Only data coming from trusted sources will be used, reducing potential risks of malware or unintended software modifications.'
        allowed-users: '[AI] The `--allowed-users` option in Systemd''s `nix` command is used to specify a list of users or user groups that are allowed to execute a service managed by Systemd. The flag takes one or more arguments, which can be usernames, group names, or numerical UIDs and GIDs prefixed with "@" for groups. The default behavior is to allow execution by the root user only. This option helps in securing services by limiting their access to specific users or groups.'
        auto-optimise-store: |-
            [AI] The `--auto-optimize-store` flag in Nix is used to enable automatic optimization of store files during the build process. Nix is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems, which allows users to easily install and manage software packages.

            When you build a package with Nix, it downloads the required sources, compiles them, and stores the resulting binary files in a central store. By default, Nix keeps multiple versions of each package, maintaining a history for rollbacks and upgrades. This results in a larger store size over time.

            The `--auto-optimize-store` flag aims to minimize this growth by automatically removing unused or outdated files from the store after a successful build. It does so by analyzing the dependencies of the built package, comparing the hashes of the new and old versions, and only keeping the necessary files that are needed for the current system configuration. In summary, it helps maintain a leaner and more efficient Nix store by removing unnecessary duplicates and outdated files.
        bash-prompt: '[AI] The `--bash-prompt` flag is not a standalone command or flag, but rather an option for the `nix` package manager in its Bash shell configuration. This option sets the Nix expression used to generate the Bash prompt to be displayed when users open a new terminal session. It allows users to customize the appearance of their command-line prompt with information such as the current working directory, user name, and active virtual environment or Git branch. The exact format of the prompt is defined by an Nix expression, which can be customized by users.'
        bash-prompt-prefix: '[AI] The `--bash-prompt-prefix` flag in Nix is used to customize the prefix text displayed before the command prompt in a Bash shell. When you run `nix-env -iA nixpkgs#bash --update-config`, it configures your Bash shell with Nix''s package manager functionality. The `--bash-prompt-prefix` flag, if set, appends the text you provide to the beginning of the command prompt. This can be useful for quickly identifying which environment or configuration is currently in use within the shell.'
        bash-prompt-suffix: '[AI] The `--bash-prompt-suffix` option in Nixpkgs is a configuration setting for the Bash shell''s prompt. When this option is set, a specified string will be appended to the end of the prompt in the terminal. This can be useful for providing additional context or information in the command line interface, such as the current branch name in Git or the current directory. The string to be appended is typically defined in a Nixpkgs configuration file or set as an environment variable.'
        build-hook: '[AI] The `--build-hook` flag in Nix packaging is used to specify a command or script that will be run after a package build process has completed successfully. This can be useful for performing additional tasks such as generating documentation, running tests, or preparing the package for distribution. The hook command should be written in a way that accepts the Nix build outputs as arguments and should return with an exit status of 0 to indicate success.'
        build-poll-interval: '[AI] The `--build-poll-interval` flag in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems, specifies the interval at which Nix checks for changes in build inputs before triggering a rebuild. A smaller value results in more frequent polling and potentially faster response to input changes but increased system resource usage, while a larger value reduces the polling frequency and resource usage. The default value is 30 seconds.'
        build-users-group: '[AI] The `nix` command with the `--build-users-group` option is used in NixOS, a Linux distribution and configuration management system based on the Nix package manager. This flag sets up a group named `build` and creates a user account with the same name if it doesn''t exist yet. By default, this user will have minimal permissions to build packages without granting excessive privileges to other users or processes in the system. This approach improves security by limiting potential damage during package builds.'
        builders: '[AI] `nix-builders` is a component of Nix, a powerful package manager for Linux and other systems. It provides pre-configured environments called builders, which automate the process of building and packaging software from source code. These builder configurations are stored in the `/nix/var/nixpieces/builders` directory and can be easily invoked using the `nix-build` or `nix-build-unpacked` commands with a specific builder name as an argument. This allows users to build software consistently across different systems while isolating the build process from the host environment.'
        builders-use-substitutes: '[AI] The `nix --builders-use-substitutes` flag is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This option enables builders in Nix to use precompiled "substitutes" instead of rebuilding packages from source. Substitutes are binary caches where precompiled packages are stored. By using substitutes, the build time can be significantly reduced since the packages do not need to be built from scratch each time they are installed. This flag is particularly useful in large-scale Nix deployments or when installing multiple packages that have a common dependency tree.'
        commit-lockfile-summary: '[AI] The `--commit-lockfile-summary` flag is a command-line option for Git, specifically for the `git rebase` and `git cherry-pick` commands. This option generates a summary of the lockfiles created during an interactive commit operation, allowing users to see which files have been locked before starting the commit process. By providing a clear overview of affected files, it helps prevent conflicts that could arise from concurrent changes to those files.'
        compress-build-log: '[AI] The `nix --compress-build-log` command is a Nix expression that compresses the build log file generated during the Nix package build process. This command can be used to reduce the size of the build logs, making it easier and faster to transfer or store them. When executed, it will create a compressed version of the log file in the same location as the original log file, with a suffix `.gz` added to the filename.'
        connect-timeout: '[AI] The `--connect-timeout` option in Nixpkgs, a configuration management system used by Nix OS, sets a maximum time limit for establishing a network connection during package builds or updates. If the connection fails to be established within the specified time frame, the operation is aborted and an error message is displayed. This can help prevent lengthy build failures due to transient network issues.'
        cores: '[AI] The `--cores` option in Nix packaging language specifies the number of CPU cores to be used during the build process. It is a way to control parallelism and optimize resource usage by limiting the number of concurrent tasks during the build. This can help avoid overloading the system and improve overall build performance. The default value for this option is often determined automatically based on the number of available cores, but it can be explicitly set using the `--cores` flag when invoking Nix commands like `nix-build` or `nix-install`.'
        debug: '[AI] `nix --debug` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. When executed with this option, Nix runs in debug mode, providing more detailed output and potentially helping to diagnose issues during Nix''s build or installation processes. This can be useful for developers and system administrators when troubleshooting complex Nix-related problems.'
        diff-hook: |-
            [AI] The `--diff-hook` option in Git is used with the `git diff` command to specify a custom script or program that will be run before displaying the differences between two commits. This can be useful for performing additional checks, formatting, or other manipulations on the output of `git diff`.

            The hook script receives the output of `git diff --raw` as its standard input and writes to its standard output the processed result. The exit status of the script determines whether Git continues with displaying the differences or not. If the script exits with a non-zero status, Git will stop and report an error.
        download-attempts: '[AI] The `--download-attempts` flag in Nix Pakages Manager determines how many times Nix will attempt to download a package and its dependencies before giving up. By default, it is set to five attempts. If you encounter network issues or other download errors, increasing this number may help in successfully downloading the packages. However, keep in mind that excessive retries could lead to unnecessary resource usage and potentially longer build times.'
        download-speed: '[AI] The `--download-speed` flag is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager used primarily in Linux environments. This option is used to limit the download speed of packages being installed or updated. By setting this flag, users can prevent their internet connection from being overwhelmed with large downloads, especially useful in situations where bandwidth is limited or shared. The value provided with this flag specifies the maximum download speed in bits per second (e.g., --download-speed 10M).'
        enforce-determinism: '[AI] `nix --enforce-determinism` is a command-line option used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This option ensures that the same Nix expression will always produce the same output, no matter which system it is run on or what order the expressions are evaluated in. This deterministic build property helps maintain consistency and reproducibility in software builds and deployments.'
        eval-cache: '[AI] The `--eval-cache` flag in Nix packaging system is used to enable or disable the use of the Nix expression evaluation cache. This cache stores previously evaluated expressions to avoid recomputing them during subsequent builds, thus improving build performance. When using this flag, Nix will either load (with `--eval-cache`) or discard (with `--no-eval-cache`) the cache based on the given argument. Enabling the cache can significantly speed up the build process for projects with complex expressions.'
        experimental-features: '[AI] The `--experimental-features` flag in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems, enables the use of experimental features not included in the stable release. These features may offer new functionalities or improvements but could also contain bugs or incompatibilities that might affect system stability. By using this flag, users can gain early access to potential advancements and provide feedback to developers for refinement before these features are officially integrated into the main Nix distribution.'
        extra-access-tokens: '[AI] The `nix` command with the `--extra-access-tokens` option is used to generate additional access tokens in Nix Pakages Manager. Access tokens are used for authentication when interacting with Nix services, such as channel fetches or uploads. With this option, extra tokens are generated beyond the default one, providing an additional layer of security by reducing the use and exposure of a single token.'
        extra-allowed-impure-host-deps: |-
            [AI] The `--extra-allowed-impure-host-deps` flag in Nix packaging system is used to allow dependencies that do not meet the standard Nix purity rules during build and runtime.

            Nix follows a strict separation of build and runtime environments for security reasons, ensuring that dependencies installed for building a package are not carried over to the runtime environment. However, some packages have impure dependencies that cannot be separated easily, such as those requiring system libraries or configurations. In such cases, the `--extra-allowed-impure-host-deps` flag is used to permit these impure dependencies during build time.

            Using this flag allows Nix to build and package the software successfully even if it relies on impure host dependencies, while still maintaining a separate runtime environment. This can be useful when dealing with legacy or third-party software that might not meet the strict Nix purity requirements.
        extra-allowed-uris: '[AI] The `--extra-allowed-uris` flag in Nix is used to specify additional URI patterns for allowing package fetches during the build or configuration management process. This flag expands upon the default set of allowed URIs, enabling users to include trusted and custom repositories by appending them as arguments when invoking the Nix command. For example: `nix-build --extra-allowed-uris "http://example.com/repo/"`.'
        extra-allowed-users: |-
            [AI] `nix --extra-allowed-users` is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This option modifies the user and group permissions of a Nix-managed installation or configuration.

            When you build or install something with Nix, it usually runs as the `nixbuild` user to ensure reproducibility and isolation from the system environment. However, some packages may need to access files owned by other users or groups for proper functionality.

            The `--extra-allowed-users` option allows you to specify additional users or groups that are granted specific permissions (like read, write, or execute) on files and directories within a Nix-managed environment. This can be useful when dealing with packages that require access to system configurations or data outside of their own user space.
        extra-experimental-features: '[AI] The `--extra-experimental-features` flag in Nix packaging system enables additional experimental features that are not enabled by default. These features may include new or unstable functionality, which could lead to compatibility issues or unexpected behavior. By using this flag, package maintainers can opt into these experimental features for their packages during the build process. It''s important to note that the use of experimental features might increase the risk of encountering bugs and instability, so it should be used with caution.'
        extra-extra-platforms: '[AI] The `--extra-extra-platforms` flag is a configuration option used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This option extends the list of supported platforms during the build process, enabling users to cross-compile packages for uncommon architectures or environments that are not included by default. By specifying this flag, Nix will attempt to download and install additional toolchains and development kits necessary for building software on these extra platforms. This allows Nix users to expand their software library with less reliance on precompiled binaries or manual installation of complex dependencies.'
        extra-hashed-mirrors: '[AI] `nix --extra-hashed-mirrors` is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Un*x systems. This option enables the use of additional, hashed NixPKG mirrors in the configuration. Hashed mirrors provide increased security as the URLs are hash values of the mirror''s public key, ensuring that only trusted servers can be used to download packages. By including more mirrors with this option, users can improve performance and reliability by choosing the closest or fastest mirror for their region.'
        extra-ignored-acls: |-
            [AI] The `nix --extra-ignored-acls` command is a Nix package manager option that modifies the way Nix handles file access control lists (ACLs) during the installation or upgrading of packages.

            When this flag is used, Nix will ignore any ACLs on files and directories that are marked as ignored by Nix. These ignored files are typically configuration files that users often customize. Ignoring the ACLs ensures that these user-defined configurations are not overwritten during package updates or installations, preserving the user's modifications.

            This flag improves user flexibility and reduces potential conflicts between package management and local customizations in the system.
        extra-nix-path: '[AI] The `nix --extra-nix-path` flag is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Un*x systems. It allows users to specify additional paths where Nix should search for packages besides the default system configuration. This can be useful in cases where there are multiple Nix installations or custom-built packages that need to be accessed from the command line.'
        extra-platforms: '[AI] The `--extra-platforms` option in Nix Pakages Manager is used to specify additional target platforms for a build or installation process. It takes a comma-separated list of platform names as an argument. For instance, `nix-build --extra-platform x86_64-linux,i686-linux` will build the package for both the x86\_64 and i686 architectures on Linux systems. This can be useful when working with software that has multi-platform support but is not pre-built for all target configurations available in Nix.'
        extra-plugin-files: '[AI] The `--extra-plugin-files` option in Nix packaging system is used to specify additional files or directories, outside of the default plugin search paths, that contain Nix expression functions or libraries for building and managing packages. This option allows users to extend the functionality of Nix without modifying the default configuration.'
        extra-sandbox-paths: '[AI] The `--extra-sandbox-paths` flag in Nix is used to specify additional directories that should be added to the application sandbox during the installation or build process. By default, Nix sets up a strict sandbox environment to ensure security and reproducibility of builds. This flag allows users to include additional paths when necessary, but it''s essential to consider potential security risks carefully before using it.'
        extra-secret-key-files: '[AI] The `--extra-secret-keys-files` option in Nix packaging builds is used to specify one or more files containing extra GPG keys to be used for signing artifacts. This option enhances the default set of trusted keys, allowing developers to include their own keys or other trusted keys not already included in the NixPKGs trust database. By adding these files during build processes, the resulting packages will be signed using the specified keys, ensuring authenticity and integrity of the software distribution.'
        extra-substituters: |-
            [AI] The `--extra-index` and `--extra-substituters` flags are options used with the `git-for-each-ref` command in Git, which is often used in conjunction with other Git commands like `make` or `nix`.

            `--extra-index` specifies a list of Git repositories to be treated as additional indexes for `git-for-each-ref`. These repositories are searched for references that match the given refspec when looking for references to update.

            `--extra-substituters` defines a comma-separated list of substitution rules, each in the format "from=to". These rules allow Git to substitute specific refs with others while traversing branches or tags. For example, `refs/tags/v1.0 = refs/releases/v1.0`. This can be useful for managing multiple repositories that share a common versioning scheme but may not have identical branch and tag structures.
        extra-system-features: '[AI] The `--extra-system-features` flag in Nix packaging system enables the installation of additional system features not included in the base Nix distribution. These features are built from third-party sources and are not part of the standard Nixpkgs repository. Using this flag allows for more extensive customization of the system, but it may also increase complexity and potential dependency issues.'
        extra-trusted-public-keys: '[AI] The `nix` flag `--extra-trusted-public-keys` is used to specify a file containing public keys to be trusted in Nix, an open-source configuration management system and package manager. These keys enable users to install packages signed with those keys even if the corresponding certificate authorities are not already trusted by Nix. This flag enhances security as it allows users to trust specific keys beyond the default set of trusted certificates, reducing the risk of installing potentially harmful software.'
        extra-trusted-substituters: '[AI] The `nix --extra-trusted-substituters` command is used in the Nix Package Manager to specify additional paths to trusted substitutes for packages. In other words, it allows you to override the default trusted sources with local or external packages. These trusted substitutes are used instead of fetching the package from the original source during the build process. This can improve build times and allow for use of custom versions or patches. The flag takes a list of paths as arguments.'
        extra-trusted-users: '[AI] The `nix --extra-trusted-users` command is a configuration option in Nix Package Manager, which allows users to specify additional trusted user accounts or groups beyond the default system and root accounts. These extra trusted users can install packages from the Nix expression language without needing to use `sudo`. This increases security by limiting package installation privileges to trusted accounts while maintaining the benefits of using a package manager for software management.'
        fallback: '[AI] The `--fallback` flag in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix-like systems, is used when installing or building a package that depends on another package with unmet dependencies. The flag tells Nix to automatically download and install the minimum set of packages necessary to satisfy the dependent package''s requirements, even if these packages are outside of the user''s current configuration. In other words, it allows installing missing dependencies as a fallback option when the standard method fails.'
        filter-syscalls: '[AI] `nix --filter-syscalls` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command filters the output of `nix-repl`, the Nix interactive shell, to only show information related to system calls. It helps developers and system administrators inspect the available system calls and their associated symbols and signatures, facilitating deeper understanding and debugging of software and system behavior.'
        flake-registry: |-
            [AI] `nix` is a powerful configuration management system and package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `--flake-registry` flag is an option used with the Nix expression language and the Nixpkgs distribution.

            This flag specifies a remote registry URL where Nix will fetch Flakes, which are self-contained, versioned build and configuration units in Nix. By using a specific registry URL, users can easily share, collaborate on, and manage their Nix expressions and configurations with others in an organized way. It simplifies the management of dependencies and ensures reproducible builds across different systems.
        fsync-metadata: '[AI] The `--fsync=metadata` option in the Nix package manager is used to ensure that metadata changes to a filesystem are immediately written to disk, providing data integrity and consistency. When building or installing packages using Nix, enabling this option can help prevent data loss or corruption in case of power failures or system crashes. It achieves this by forcing the operating system to synchronously write metadata to the physical disk after each change. However, it may come at the cost of reduced performance due to increased disk I/O operations.'
        gc-reserved-space: '[AI] The `--gc-reserved-space` flag in Nix packaging system is used to specify the minimum amount of memory that Nix''s garbage collector (GC) should not free during the build process. This flag helps ensure that enough memory remains available for the build process to complete successfully, particularly when building large or complex packages. By reserving a certain amount of memory for GC, Nix ensures that it does not inadvertently free necessary resources and cause build failures.'
        hashed-mirrors: '[AI] `nix --hashed-mirrors` is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager and configuration management system. This option enables Nix to use hashed mirror URLs, ensuring that the exact version of a package is downloaded from a specific mirror. Hashed mirrors provide improved security and reliability by checking the hash of the data before downloading, ensuring authenticity and integrity. Additionally, they can help reduce network traffic and improve performance since only different hashes require redownloads.'
        http-connections: '[AI] The `--http-connections` flag in Nix is used to configure the number of simultaneous HTTP connections that Nix can make during package build or update processes. By default, Nix will use OS-level settings for the maximum number of open connections. However, using this flag allows users to override the default and set a specific limit. For instance, `nix-build --http-connections 5` sets the limit to five simultaneous HTTP connections. This can be helpful in environments where limiting the number of active connections is necessary to conserve resources or prevent potential network overload.'
        http2: '[AI] The `nix` command with the `--http2` flag is related to Nix, a powerful and configurable package manager for Linux and other Un*x systems. The `--http2` flag specifically enables or checks for HTTP/2 support in Nix''s networking stack. HTTP/2 is a newer version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that provides significant performance improvements over its predecessor, HTTP/1.1. With HTTP/2, multiple requests can be made over a single connection, and resources are delivered in an efficient order. The `nix --http2` command may be used to check if Nix itself supports HTTP/2 or to enable HTTP/2 support for network services managed by Nix.'
        ignore-try: '[AI] The `--ignore-try` option in Nix is used when running a Nix expression or command in the Nix shell. It instructs Nix to not attempt to build or install anything if a failure occurs during the previous build or installation step. This can be useful for debugging or testing specific parts of a Nix expression, as it prevents unnecessary rebuilds and speeds up the development process. If an error is encountered in a later step, subsequent steps will still be executed.'
        ignored-acls: '[AI] The `nix --ignored-acls` flag is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager used primarily in Linux and Unix systems. This option disables the checking of Access Control Lists (ACLs) when performing file operations such as installation or upgrading of Nix packages. By ignoring ACLs, Nix overwrites files without prompting for user confirmation, even if it means discarding existing ACL permissions. This can be useful in automated or scripted environments where consistent file access is prioritized over maintaining specific ACL settings.'
        impersonate-linux-26: |-
            [AI] The `nix` command with the option `--impersonate-linux-26` is a feature in Nix Package Manager, which allows running commands as if they were on a Linux distribution with the kernel version 4.9 (or equivalent to Linux distro 26).

            When you use this option, Nix creates an isolated environment that emulates the specified Linux system, by mounting necessary root filesystems and setting up necessary environment variables. This is useful for running software that has dependencies on specific Linux distributions or kernels which might not be available in your current system.

            Additionally, it enables you to test your application on a specific Linux distro and kernel version locally without the need of a dedicated machine. The results obtained from this environment can help you identify potential issues related to the OS or kernel that may affect your software's compatibility.
        keep-build-log: '[AI] The `--keep-build-log` flag in Nix is used to preserve the build logs after a successful or failed build process. By default, Nix deletes build logs after a build completes. However, with this flag, the build logs are kept, allowing for easier debugging and analysis of build processes. It''s particularly useful for large or complex builds where understanding what happened during the build is essential.'
        keep-derivations: '[AI] The `--keep-derivations` flag in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems, instructs Nix to keep the build artifacts or intermediate files generated during the package build process. These derivations store the build history and allow for efficient rebuilding of packages and rollback to previous builds if needed. By default, Nix deletes these files after successful builds to save disk space.'
        keep-env-derivations: '[AI] The `--keep-env-derivations` flag in Nix packaging system instructs Nix to keep the environment derivations after a build or installation. Environment derivations are caches of built packages and their dependencies, which allow for faster rebuilds and consistent builds across different machines. By keeping these derivations, subsequent builds using the same Nix expression can leverage the existing cache instead of rebuilding everything from scratch. This flag can be useful for continuous integration or development scenarios where frequent builds are common.'
        keep-failed: '[AI] `nix --keep-failed` is a command-line option used with Nix Package Manager. It instructs Nix to not remove the build artifacts and cache of failed build attempts. By default, Nix removes these files to free up disk space for new builds. Keeping failed build artifacts can be useful for debugging or analyzing why a build failed.'
        keep-going: '[AI] The `--keep-going` flag in Nix package manager is used to continue installing or building packages even if one of them fails. Instead of aborting the entire operation, it moves on to the next package and continues until all desired packages have been installed or built. This can be useful when dealing with complex systems where some dependencies might not build perfectly every time, but you still want to proceed with the rest of the installation.'
        keep-outputs: '[AI] The `--keep-outputs` flag in Nix is used to preserve the output files generated during a build or installation process. This flag prevents Nix from deleting these files once the build or installation is complete, allowing users to keep and reuse them for future reference or further processing.'
        log-format: '[AI] The `--log-format` option in Nix packaging language is used to specify the format of logs generated during the build and evaluation process. Nix supports multiple log formats including "plain", "json", and "progress". The plain format displays messages as they are produced, while json format outputs logs in JSON format which can be easily parsed by other tools. The progress format shows a progress bar indicating the completion percentage of each stage during the build process. This option helps to customize log output for better integration with CI systems or for further processing using other tools.'
        log-lines: '[AI] The `--log-lines` flag is a command-line option used with some Nix packages, particularly those related to logging and system monitoring. This flag instructs the Nix daemon or the specified command to output log messages in lines instead of producing detailed logs or just exiting with a success or failure status. This can be useful for quickly checking the recent log entries without having to deal with extensive log files.'
        max-build-log-size: '[AI] The `--max-build-log-size` flag in Nix is used to set a limit on the size of build logs that Nix produces during package builds. By default, Nix does not impose any limit on the size of build logs. This flag allows users to set an upper limit, preventing excessive log files from being generated which may cause disk space issues or affect build performance. The value is specified in bytes. For instance, `--max-build-log-size 10m` sets a limit of 10 megabytes (10 * 1024^2 bytes).'
        max-free: '[AI] The `--max-free` flag in Nix is used to set a limit on the amount of memory that can be used for freeing up allocated memory during a Nix build or configuration management operation. This flag helps prevent out-of-memory errors and provides better control over system resources by limiting the memory consumption of Nix processes. Setting `--max-free` to a specific value (in megabytes) restricts the maximum amount of memory that Nix can use for garbage collection, ensuring that other critical processes running on the system have enough memory to function properly.'
        max-jobs: '[AI] The `--max-jobs` option in the `nix` command-line build tool sets the maximum number of parallel jobs for its tasks. By default, it''s set to 1, meaning only one task will be executed at a time. You can increase this value to take advantage of multiple CPUs or cores and speed up the build process. For example, setting `--max-jobs 5` would allow Nix to run up to five tasks concurrently.'
        max-silent-time: '[AI] The `--max-silent-time` option in Nix packages manager sets a limit on the amount of time Nix can run without outputting any progress messages. If a build or command takes longer than this time, Nix will print an update message to keep users informed about the ongoing process. The default value is 180 seconds, but it can be adjusted with this flag during the execution of Nix commands.'
        min-free: '[AI] The `nix --min-install` or `--min-free` command is used in Nix Package Manager to install only the minimal set of packages necessary for a system to run. This means that only essential packages will be installed, excluding development tools, desktops environments, and other non-essential software. It helps to keep the installation lightweight and focused on the basic functionalities of the system.'
        min-free-check-interval: '[AI] The `--min-free-check-interval` flag is a configuration option for the Nix Package Manager. It sets the minimum interval (in seconds) between automatic garbage collection runs. This helps in managing memory usage and freeing up disk space by removing unused or unnecessary cache data. By default, this value is set to 300 seconds (5 minutes). Users can adjust this value based on their system''s resources and requirements for faster or slower collection intervals.'
        nar-buffer-size: '[AI] `nix` is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `--extra-options` flag is used to pass additional options to Nix expressions or builders. Specifically, `--nar-buffer-size` is an option for Nix''s NAR (Nix Archive) format. It sets the buffer size for reading NAR files, which can improve performance when dealing with large NARs by reducing the number of read calls and increasing the amount of data read in each call. The value is typically specified in bytes. For example, `--nar-buffer-size=1M` sets the buffer size to 1 megabyte.'
        narinfo-cache-negative-ttl: '[AI] The `--narinfo-cache-negative-ttl` flag in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems, sets the time-to-live (TTL) for negative entries in the Nix expression cache. Negative entries are records of expressions that do not exist or fail to build, which can help speed up subsequent builds by avoiding unnecessary recomputations. The TTL specifies how long Nix should remember these negative entries before checking the server again. A shorter TTL reduces the risk of stale information but increases network traffic, while a longer TTL saves bandwidth but may lead to unnecessary recomputations.'
        narinfo-cache-positive-ttl: |-
            [AI] `nix` is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The option `--narinfo-cache-positive-ttl` is related to its caching behavior.

            This flag sets the Time To Live (TTL) for positive entries in Nix's Nashorn script cache, which is used to store compiled Java scripts. The cache helps to speed up the build process by reusing previously compiled scripts instead of recompiling them every time.

            Setting `--narinfo-cache-positive-ttl` sets the duration for how long a positive entry should be considered valid before being replaced with a new one. A larger value increases the cache hit rate and reduces build times, but may cause issues if the cached script has been updated since the cache was last built. Conversely, a smaller value ensures that scripts are always recompiled from their latest source code, but at the cost of increased build times.
        netrc-file: '[AI] The `--netrc-file` option in Nix is used to specify a custom NetRC file for authentication when using Nix''s built-in tools for working with remote servers, such as `nixpkgs-fetch`, `nixos-rebuild`, or `nixos-install`. A NetRC file is a plain text file that contains machine-specific authentication information, including the hostname or IP address and login credentials. By using the `--netrc-file` option, users can provide Nix with a custom NetRC file instead of relying on the system-wide one, allowing for better security management and isolation between different machines or projects.'
        nix-path: '[AI] The `--nix-path` option in Nix is used to specify a custom Nix expression evaluation path, overriding the default paths where Nix looks for built-in packages and user-defined configurations. By providing a list of directories or Nix expressions as a string, you can customize the environment by including additional Nix repositories or specific configurations from external sources. This can be useful in managing complex Nix environments with multiple versions or customizations.'
        no-accept-flake-config: |-
            [AI] `nix` is a configuration management system and package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The option `--no-accept-flake-config` is used when running Nix commands to disable the acceptance of Flake configurations.

            Flake is a feature in Nix that allows users to manage multiple projects as part of a single Nix expression, making it easier to organize and build complex projects with interdependent components. However, this also requires trusting the external configuration files, which could potentially introduce vulnerabilities or errors.

            By using `--no-accept-flake-config`, you're instructing Nix not to accept Flake configurations when building or installing packages, ensuring that only trusted and locally defined configurations are used in your build process. This can help improve security and reduce the risk of unintended consequences from external configurations.
        no-allow-dirty: |-
            [AI] The `nix --no-allow-dirty` flag is a command-line option used with Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It disables the "allow-dirty" mode in Nix's configuration.

            In "allow-dirty" mode, Nix will install or upgrade packages even if their installed versions differ from those specified in the configuration file (also known as the Nix expression). This can be useful for testing and development, but it may also lead to inconsistent system states and potential conflicts between different package versions.

            By using the `--no-allow-dirty` flag, you enforce that the packages will only be installed or upgraded according to their specified configurations in the Nix expression, ensuring a more consistent and predictable system state.
        no-allow-import-from-derivation: '[AI] The `--no-allow-import-from-derivation` flag in Nix is used to prevent packages from importing dependencies that are built as part of the same build tree or derivation. This helps enforce stricter separation between dependencies, which can be beneficial for reproducibility and security. When this flag is set, Nix will reject attempts to import packages that are not explicitly listed in the `package.conf` file or installed from external sources.'
        no-allow-new-privileges: '[AI] The `nix --no-allow-new-privileges` flag is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This flag disables the allowing of new privileges for child processes created by Nix commands. In other words, it enforces that Nix-managed processes run with the same or less privilege than their parent process. This helps improve security by preventing unintended escalation of privileges within the system.'
        no-allow-symlinked-store: '[AI] The `--no-allow-symlinked-store` flag is a command line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This option disables the allowing of symlinks in the store, which is the default location where Nix installs and manages packages. With this flag set, Nix will refuse to create or update symlinks in the store, ensuring that only the original files are installed and managed. This can be useful for enhancing security or consistency in the package management environment.'
        no-allow-unsafe-native-code-during-evaluation: '[AI] The `--no-allow-unsafe-native-code-during-evaluation` flag in Nix is used to disallow evaluation of expressions that contain native code, which could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities. Native code refers to low-level code written in languages like C or Assembly, which can bypass the Nix sandbox and access the host system. By setting this flag, Nix enforces a more restrictive evaluation environment, reducing the risk of potential security issues.'
        no-auto-optimise-store: |-
            [AI] The `nix --no-auto-optimize-store` flag is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This flag disables the automatic optimization of the Nix store, which is a central component of the Nix build system.

            The Nix store is a hierarchical filesystem where all packages are built and stored in isolated environments. The optimization process involves rebuilding existing packages when their dependencies change to ensure that they are up-to-date and compatible with each other. By default, this optimization occurs automatically whenever the package database is updated or a build command is run.

            However, disabling this option (`--no-auto-optimize-store`) can be useful in certain situations where manual intervention is required or when there are issues with the optimization process. For example, if you have made changes to a package's configuration files and want to test those changes without having the whole package rebuilt, using this flag can help prevent unnecessary builds.

            Additionally, this flag can also be useful for debugging Nix packages or when working on large projects with complex dependencies where manual intervention is necessary for ensuring that the builds proceed correctly.
        no-builders-use-substitutes: |-
            [AI] The `nix --no-builders-use-substitutes` flag is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. It disables the use of substitutes by builders in Nix expressions.

            Substitutes are precompiled binary packages stored on remote servers, which can be used instead of building packages from source. Builders are custom components that modify or extend the Nix expression language to create packages that cannot be built using standard methods.

            By setting `--no-builders-use-substitutes`, you instruct Nix not to use substitutes when invoking builders, which may be necessary if you want to ensure that a custom builder uses the latest source code or if there are issues with the availability or authenticity of the substitutes.
        no-compress-build-log: '[AI] The `--no-compress-build-log` flag in Nix is used to disable the compression of the build log files generated during the Nix package build process. By default, Nix compresses build logs before storing them in the Nix store, which can save disk space. However, this flag can be passed to the `nix-build` or `nix-store` commands to prevent compression of the build logs if desired. This may result in larger amounts of disk space being used for the build logs.'
        no-enforce-determinism: '[AI] `nix --no-enforce-determinism` is a command line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This option disables deterministic build and package management in Nix. Deterministic builds ensure that the same source code will always produce the same output when built, which is important for creating reliable and reproducible software. However, enforcing determinism can also limit the ability to use non-deterministic software or build systems, such as those using dynamic libraries or other non-deterministic components. Disabling this option allows users to use such software in their Nix environments despite the potential for non-reproducible builds.'
        no-eval-cache: '[AI] `nix --no-eval-cache` is a command-line option for Nix Package Manager. It disables the use of the Nix expression evaluation cache. This cache stores the results of previously evaluated expressions to speed up the build process, especially when dealing with large or complex configurations. However, disabling it can be useful in situations where you want to ensure that all expressions are re-evaluated from scratch each time, such as when debugging issues or testing changes.'
        no-fallback: '[AI] The `--no-fallback` flag in Nix is used when invoking Nix expressions or commands to prevent the use of fallbacks. In other words, it ensures that only the explicitly specified package versions or configurations are installed or built, and no alternative versions will be considered if the primary choice fails. This can help ensure consistency and reproducibility in Nix builds and installations.'
        no-filter-syscalls: '[AI] The `nix --no-filter-syscalls` command is a flag used with Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This flag disables filtering of system calls during the build or execution process. System calls are essential interactions between user space and the kernel, allowing processes to perform various tasks such as file I/O, networking, and process management. By disabling this filter, Nix allows all system calls made by the built or executed software to be observed without modification. This can be useful for debugging or analyzing system behavior, but it may also increase the resource usage or security risks of the build or execution process.'
        no-fsync-metadata: '[AI] The `--no-fsync-metadata` flag is a command-line option used with the `rsync` or `rsync-avahpd` synchronization tools in the NixOS environment. It disables the syncing of file metadata to the disk after every write operation during data transfer. This can improve performance by reducing the number of disk I/O operations but at the risk of potential data loss if an unexpected power failure occurs before all changes have been written to disk on the destination server. It is generally recommended for use in trusted environments where data consistency is not a concern and high-performance is desired.'
        no-http2: '[AI] The `nix` command with the `--no-http2` flag is used to configure Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems, to disable the usage of HTTP/2 during package installation or update processes. This flag can be passed when running commands like `nix-env`, `nix-build`, or `nix-fetch`. By disabling HTTP/2, you may experience slower download speeds, but it could potentially help in bypassing certain network restrictions or proxies that do not support the protocol.'
        no-ignore-try: '[AI] The `--no-ignore-try` flag is used with the `nix` package manager in a NixOS configuration or build environment. This option disables the automatic handling of ignored files and builds them even if they have been marked to be ignored by the `.nix-env` or `.nixpkgs` file. By default, Nix will not attempt to build any files listed as ignored in these files. However, with `--no-ignore-try`, Nix will try to build them regardless of their status in the ignore files. This can be useful when you want to force a rebuild or troubleshoot issues where specific ignored files might need to be built.'
        no-impersonate-linux-26: '[AI] The `nix` flag `--no-impersonate-linux-26` is used in Nix packaging to prevent the creation of a Linux container with a specific version, in this case Linux 2.6. By using this flag during the build process, Nix will not automatically create a new Linux container for building the package, but instead use the existing Linux 2.6 container if it already exists. This can be useful for saving resources or when dealing with specific compatibility issues.'
        no-keep-build-log: '[AI] The `--no-keep-build-log` flag in Nix is used to prevent Nix from keeping build logs after a build process completes. By default, Nix keeps build logs for troubleshooting and debugging purposes. However, if you want to save disk space or just don''t need the logs, you can use this flag to discard them after the build finishes.'
        no-keep-derivations: '[AI] The `--no-keep-derivations` flag in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems, instructs Nix to not keep the intermediate build files or derivations after a successful build. This can help save disk space and improve build times by removing unnecessary files. However, it also means that if a rebuild is needed, Nix would have to download and rebuild the dependencies from scratch instead of using the cached derivations.'
        no-keep-env-derivations: '[AI] The `--no-keep-env-derivations` flag in Nix is used when building packages to prevent Nix from keeping the files generated during the build process as derivation files. By default, Nix keeps these files for reuse in case of future builds with the same input parameters to save time and resources. However, if this option is set, each build will generate new derivations, which can be useful for ensuring clean builds or when dealing with issues related to cached derivations.'
        no-keep-failed: '[AI] The `nix --no-keep-fail` command is a option used in Nix packaging system. It instructs Nix to not keep the build artifacts of failed builds. In other words, if a build fails, Nix will delete the created intermediate files instead of keeping them for potential debugging or analysis purposes. This can help save disk space and reduce clutter in the build environment.'
        no-keep-going: '[AI] The `--no-keep-going` flag in Nix packaging language is used to prevent the build process from continuing if a previous build failed. It ensures that each build stage depends on the successful completion of the preceding stages, enforcing a strict order and improving the reliability of the build process.'
        no-keep-outputs: '[AI] The `--no-keep-outputs` flag in Nix is used to prevent Nix from keeping the build outputs after a successful build. This means that once the build finishes, the intermediate and output files will be deleted automatically. This can help save disk space and reduce clutter, especially when building multiple packages or running builds frequently.'
        no-preallocate-contents: '[AI] The `--no-preallocate-contents` flag in Nix packaging is used to disable the preallocation of file contents during build or store creation. When this option is set, Nix will only allocate the exact amount of space required for the final output instead of allocating extra space upfront. This can be beneficial for large builds and save disk space, but may increase I/O overhead due to more frequent resizing of files.'
        no-print-missing: '[AI] The `nix --no-print-missing` command is a flag used with Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This flag instructs Nix not to print messages about missing dependencies when installing or building packages. It''s useful when automating tasks where you want to suppress such messages for quieter output.'
        no-pure-eval: |-
            [AI] The `--no-pure-eval` flag in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems, disables the "pure evaluation" mode of Nix expressions. In this mode, Nix automatically evaluates all dependencies of an expression during build time, ensuring that the same environment is used to build all parts of a project.

            With `--no-pure-eval`, this behavior is disabled, and the dependencies are not automatically evaluated during build time. Instead, the system relies on the installed Nix packages to provide the required dependencies at runtime. This can be useful in certain environments where automatic evaluation is not desired or feasible, such as production systems or when building large or complex projects that take a long time to evaluate.
        no-require-sigs: '[AI] The `nix --no-require-sigs` flag is a command-line option used with Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This option disables signature checks during the installation or upgrade of software packages managed by Nix. By using `--no-require-sigs`, users can bypass the verification of the digital signatures attached to Nix expressions, potentially installing packages that may not be trusted or have been tampered with. This can pose a security risk and is generally discouraged. It''s important to use this option only when you trust the source of the packages and understand the risks involved.'
        no-restrict-eval: '[AI] The `--no-restrict-eval` flag is a command-line option for the Nix package manager. This option disables a security restriction that prevents scripts from loading and executing arbitrary modules during evaluation. With this flag, any script passed to Nix''s `eval` function can load and execute any module it wants, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities if the scripts are not fully trusted. It is recommended to use this option only when working with trusted code.'
        no-run-diff-hook: '[AI] The `--no-run-diff-hook` flag in Nix is used when building or installing packages to prevent Nix from running the diff hook script after the build or installation process. Diff hooks are scripts that can be defined to automatically generate patches for source code changes during the build or installation process. By using `--no-run-diff-hook`, you can disable this functionality if it is not required for your use case. This flag can help save time and resources by skipping the diff hook script execution, which may not be necessary in every situation.'
        no-sandbox: '[AI] `nix --no-sandbox` is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This option disables the Nix sandboxing feature. Sandboxing is a security measure that isolates the build and execution environments of software packages to prevent potential vulnerabilities from affecting the system as a whole. By using `--no-sandbox`, users bypass this safety mechanism, which can increase system risk but may be necessary for certain use cases, such as installing or building software with specific dependencies that don''t work within the sandboxed environment.'
        no-sandbox-fallback: '[AI] The `--no-sandbox-fallback` flag in Nix Pakages Manager is used to disable the use of the sandbox fallback mode. In this mode, if Nix fails to create a sandboxed environment for building or installing a package, it will attempt to run the build command outside of a sandbox instead. Disabling this fallback can enhance security by ensuring all build processes are run within isolated sandboxes but may result in build failures if the system does not have the necessary dependencies installed.'
        no-show-trace: '[AI] The `nix --no-show-trace` flag is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Un*x systems. This option suppresses the display of trace messages that Nix generates when executing commands or building packages, resulting in a quieter output during operation. In essence, it hides the detailed progress information to provide a cleaner and more focused terminal experience.'
        no-substitute: '[AI] The `--no-substitute` flag is used with the `nix` package manager, specifically when building or installing software from a Nix expression or configuration file. This flag disables the substitution of built-in or precompiled packages and downloads and builds the software from source instead. When this flag is not set, Nix will check its cache for existing builds and use those if available to save time and resources.'
        no-sync-before-registering: '[AI] The `--no-sync-before-registering` flag in Nix packaging is used to prevent automatic synchronization of a package''s source code from its upstream repository before registration. This means that the build and check phases of the Nix expression will proceed without waiting for the sync phase, potentially saving time if the sources are already locally available or don''t need updating. However, this may result in using stale sources if new versions have been released since the last synchronization. Therefore, it is generally recommended to use this flag only when you are certain that the local sources are up-to-date and reliable.'
        no-trace-function-calls: '[AI] The `--no-trace-function-calls` flag in Nix is used when building packages to disable function call tracing. This means that Nix will not output a detailed trace of each function call during the build process, resulting in faster build times and less verbose output. It''s an option for those who prefer a more streamlined build experience over comprehensive debugging information.'
        no-trace-verbose: |-
            [AI] The `nix --no-trace-verbose` command is used with Nix Package Manager, a software installation system for Linux and other Un*x systems. This command disables both tracing and verbose output during package management operations.

            Tracing records detailed information about each step taken by the Nix command to help diagnose issues. Verbose output provides extra information about each action and its results. Disabling both with `--no-trace-verbose` can result in a quieter, faster execution of commands.
        no-use-case-hack: '[AI] The `--no-use-case-hack` flag is a option for the `nix` package manager, specifically used when building or installing packages. This flag disables Nix''s "use case hack," which automatically sets the output file name based on the build input and expected output. By disabling this feature, users have more control over the file names of their outputs.'
        no-use-registries: '[AI] The `nix --no-use-registries` flag is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This option disables the use of remote package repositories or registries during the build process. As a result, Nix will only use locally available packages and their dependencies from the `/nix/store` directory to construct the system configuration. This can be useful in offline environments where access to external repositories is not possible or when enforcing strict security policies.'
        no-use-sqlite-wal: '[AI] The `--no-use-sqlite-wal` flag in Nix is used to disable the use of SQLite Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) feature during database transactions in Nix''s SQLite3 package. WAL is a mechanism that allows for faster and more reliable transaction processing by recording changes in a log file before they are written to the main database file. However, enabling this feature requires additional disk space and can increase I/O usage. By passing `--no-use-sqlite-wal` during Nix build or installation, SQLite will not use WAL, which may result in reduced disk space usage and lower system resource consumption at the expense of slower transaction processing.'
        no-warn-dirty: '[AI] The `nix` command with the flag `--no-warn-dirty` is used in Nix Package Manager to suppress warnings about building or installing packages that already have unsynchronized modifications or changes in their files. This means that Nix will proceed with the build or installation without displaying the usual warning messages. The flag can be helpful when intentionally working on modified packages without interruptions, but it is important to note that using this flag may introduce inconsistencies and potential conflicts with system packages.'
        plugin-files: '[AI] `nix` is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `--plugin-files` flag is used when invoking Nix expressions or builds from the command line. It specifies one or more files containing Nix plugins, which are extensions that add new functionality to Nix. These files are located outside of the standard Nix configuration and can be used to customize or extend Nix''s behavior.'
        post-build-hook: '[AI] `nix --post-build-hook` is a command-line option in Nix Package Manager used to specify a script or command that gets executed after the build process of a Nix expression or derivation has completed successfully. This can be useful for performing additional tasks, such as installing or configuring software dependencies, generating documentation, or running tests, among others. The hook is typically defined in the `postInstall` or `postBuild` field of the Nix expression or derivation configuration file.'
        pre-build-hook: '[AI] The `--pre-build-hook` flag in Nix Pakages is used to specify a command or script that will be run before building a Nix Package. This can be useful for setting up the build environment, downloading dependencies, or performing other pre-processing tasks. The hook command is executed in the build environment, and its output is ignored by Nix.'
        preallocate-contents: '[AI] The `--preallocate-contents` flag in Nix is used during the building or installation process to allocate and initialize the entire size of a file before writing data into it. This can lead to improved performance and reduced disk I/O when dealing with large files, as the operating system does not need to repeatedly expand the file size as new data is added. However, this flag may increase memory usage during the build process.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] `nix --print-build-logs` is a command in Nix package manager that prints the logs of the last build attempt for a specific project or package. It helps users to diagnose build issues by providing detailed information about the build process, including any errors or warnings encountered during the build. The output includes timestamps, commands executed, and their respective outputs. This command can be useful when troubleshooting Nix build problems or understanding the build history of a project.'
        print-missing: '[AI] The `nix-print --missing` command is a utility provided by Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. It is used to list the names of packages and their dependencies that are not installed but are required to build or run a particular project. The output shows the missing packages with their versions, if available in the Nix expressions or channel repositories, allowing users to easily install them to complete their setup.'
        pure-eval: '[AI] `nix --pure-eval` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other UnIX systems. It allows users to evaluate expressions written in Nix expression language directly, without having to create or modify configuration files. This can be useful for quickly testing small expressions or functions without affecting the global Nix environment. The output of `nix --pure-eval` is the result of evaluating the provided expression.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `nix --quiet` command is a flag used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This flag is used to suppress all output from Nix except for error messages. It is often used in automated scripts or continuous integration environments where the default output from Nix may interfere with the desired workflow. In summary, `nix --quiet` runs Nix commands without printing progress messages or other informational outputs.'
        relaxed-sandbox: '[AI] The `nix --relaxed-sandbox` command is used in Nix Package Manager to disable some of its built-in security restrictions, also known as the sandbox, when installing or building packages. This allows the use of untrusted software or configurations that might be blocked under the standard sandbox settings. It should be noted that using this option can introduce potential security risks and is generally discouraged unless necessary for specific use cases.'
        repeat: '[AI] The `--repeat` option in Nix packaging language is used to specify that a build or command should be run multiple times with the same input and output being produced each time. This can be useful for building packages where multiple invocations of the build system are required to produce the final artifact, or when running tests or checking consistency of outputs. The number of repetitions can be specified using `--repeat N`, where N is a positive integer.'
        require-sigs: |-
            [AI] The `nix --require-sigs` flag is a command-line option used with Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This flag is used to enforce signature verification during the installation or upgrade of packages.

            When this flag is set, Nix will only proceed with the installation or update of a package if it can verify that the package's signing key matches the one used to sign the package archive. This adds an extra layer of security to prevent the installation of potentially malicious software.

            In summary, `nix --require-sigs` is a security feature that requires Nix to validate the digital signatures of downloaded packages before installing or upgrading them.
        restrict-eval: |-
            [AI] The `--restrict-eval` flag in Nix is used to restrict the evaluation of expressions within a Nix expression or configuration file. By default, Nix evaluates expressions in a relatively permissive way, allowing for dynamic and interactive behavior. However, this can pose security risks if malicious code is accidentally or intentionally included in the expressions.

            The `--restrict-eval` flag introduces stricter evaluation rules. It disables several potentially risky features such as dynamic imports, importing from untrusted sources, and evaluating expressions marked with the `unsafePerformIO` function. This helps to prevent unintended side effects or code execution during evaluation.

            Using this flag enhances the security of Nix configurations by limiting what can be evaluated dynamically, making it a recommended practice when dealing with potentially untrusted configuration data or third-party packages.
        run-diff-hook: '[AI] `nix --run-diff-hook` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command triggers the execution of a specified hook function when a difference has been detected between the current system configuration and the desired new configuration while performing an upgrade or rollback using Nix. Hook functions can be custom scripts written by users to modify or add functionality during configuration changes.'
        sandbox: '[AI] The `nix --sandbox` command is a feature in Nix Package Manager, which creates an isolated environment for running commands or building packages. This sandbox prevents any unwanted side effects on the global system by installing packages and their dependencies only within that specific environment. The command sets up a new Nix expression context and runs given commands inside it, discarding changes once the session is closed.'
        sandbox-build-dir: '[AI] The `--sandbox-build-dir` flag in Nix is used to specify a build directory for sandboxed builds. A Nix sandbox is an isolated environment for building and installing software packages. By setting this flag, the user can direct Nix to use a particular directory as the build area for the sandboxed build, allowing for better control over build outputs and easier management of multiple builds.'
        sandbox-dev-shm-size: '[AI] The `--sandbox-dev-shm-size` flag in Nix is used to configure the size of the /dev/shm (Temporary Filesystem) used in the Nix sandbox environment during package builds. This option allows users to set a custom size for this shared memory segment, which can be useful when building large packages or working with limited system resources. By default, Nix sets an adequate size for /dev/shm, but it can be adjusted using this flag.'
        sandbox-fallback: '[AI] The `--sandbox-fallback` flag in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems, allows running commands outside of the default sandbox environment if it fails to start or if there is no internet connection for fetching required resources. This can be useful when trying to run commands that have dependencies not available in the local Nix store or when experiencing network connectivity issues. With this flag, commands are executed with minimal Nix security restrictions but without the benefits of a sandboxed environment.'
        sandbox-paths: '[AI] The `--sandbox-paths` flag in Nix is used to specify a list of directories where Nix expresses permissions for sandboxed builds. It enhances security by restricting build environments to these specified paths, preventing unintended file access or modifications outside of the defined areas.'
        secret-key-files: '[AI] The `--secret-key-files` option in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems, specifies one or more files containing OpenSSH private keys to be used for authentication when performing remote tasks such as building and managing system configurations. It enhances the security of Nix operations by avoiding storing sensitive private key information in plain text or hardcoding it into scripts. Instead, users maintain their private keys securely outside of Nix.'
        show-trace: '[AI] The `nix-show-trace` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It generates a detailed trace file that shows the sequence of build and configuration steps taken when installing or updating a specific package using Nix. This information can be helpful for debugging issues with package builds or for understanding the underlying processes of the Nix package manager. The output is saved to a file, usually with a `.trace` extension, allowing further analysis with tools like `strace` or `grep`.'
        stalled-download-timeout: '[AI] The `--stalled-download-timeout` flag in Nix package manager is used to specify the maximum amount of time (in seconds) that a download should take before it is considered stalled and Nix will attempt to resume it. If the download takes longer than this set time, Nix will try to redownload it from the origin or other mirrors. This can help in cases where a download is interrupted due to network issues or other temporary problems.'
        store: '[AI] `nix --store` is a command used in Nix packaging system. It creates or displays the location of the Nix store, which is a centralized and isolated file tree where all package builds are stored. The store is essential for the correct functioning of NixPKGs as it provides a consistent environment for building and managing software packages.'
        substitute: '[AI] `nix-replace-expr` or simply `nix --substitute` is a command-line utility in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. It allows users to perform textual substitutions on expressions written in Nix expression language (Nixml), which is used in Nix configuration files. The command takes the form `nix --substitute PATTERN EXPRESSION [FILE]`, where `PATTERN` is a regular expression, `EXPRESSION` is a Nix expression that describes the replacement, and `[FILE]` (optional) specifies a file containing Nix expressions to be processed. The command replaces occurrences of the pattern with the expression in the input Nix expressions, producing new Nix expressions as output. This can be useful for creating derived configurations or modifying existing ones without manually editing configuration files.'
        substituters: '[AI] `nx` is a DevOps tool built with Node.js and Angular, used for running tasks in multiple projects and managing workflows. The `--substitutions` or `--substituters` flag is an option for the `nx run` command. It applies text substitution rules to the output of a task, allowing for dynamic replacement of placeholders with specific values during the build process. This feature is helpful when dealing with configuration files, version numbers, or other variable content in your projects. The flag takes a JSON object as its argument, which defines the substitution rules and their corresponding values.'
        sync-before-registering: '[AI] The `nix --sync-before-registrating` command is a Nix package manager feature that ensures that all system configurations are synchronized before registering new packages or profiles. When you run this command, Nix checks for any unsynced configuration changes and syncs them with the Nix store before proceeding with the registration of new packages or profiles. This helps maintain consistency in your system by ensuring that all changes are tracked and applied in a controlled manner.'
        system: |-
            [AI] The `nix --system` command is a part of Nix Package Manager, a powerful and configuration management system and package manager for Linux and other Unix systems.

            This specific command is used to install or manage the system packages within the Nix environment. System packages are software that are essential for the proper functioning of an operating system and its services. These packages are installed in the `/nix/store` directory, under the `/nix/var/lib/nix/profile` directories for individual users or in `/run/current-system` for the entire system.

            The command is typically invoked with other subcommands like `upgrade`, `install`, or `remove` to update, install, or uninstall the system packages, respectively. For example, `nix --system upgrade` would perform an upgrade of all installed system packages.
        system-features: '[AI] The `nix` flag `--system-features` is used in the Nix Package Manager to enable or disable system-wide features during the build and configuration of a package. System features are additional packages or services that can be installed alongside regular packages. By using this flag, system administrators can control which system features will be available for use across the entire system. It allows for fine-grained control over the installed software, reducing potential security risks and ensuring consistent system configurations.'
        tarball-ttl: '[AI] The `--tarball-ttl` option in Nix package manager controls the time-to-live (TTL) of tarballs (compressed archive files). It specifies for how long a particular version of a tarball should be cached and reused before downloading a new one. This can help improve build performance by reducing network traffic and disk I/O, as well as ensuring consistency across builds. The value can be set in seconds or using common time units like hours, days, or weeks. For example, `--tarball-ttl 1w` sets the TTL to one week.'
        timeout: '[AI] The `--timeout` option in Nix packaging language is used to specify a timeout for a build or installation process. If the operation does not complete within the specified time, Nix will consider it failed. This can help prevent long-running or even infinite builds and improve overall system performance. The timeout value is typically given in seconds.'
        trace-function-calls: '[AI] `nix --trace-function-calls` is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Un*x systems. This option enables detailed tracing of function calls made during the build or evaluation process. It generates a verbose output, providing a step-by-step breakdown of the functions being called, along with additional information such as input files and timings. This level of detail can be useful for debugging complex builds or understanding the inner workings of Nix expressions.'
        trace-verbose: '[AI] `nix --trace-verbose` is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This option enables extensive debugging output while running Nix commands, providing detailed information about each step taken during the execution of the command. It''s useful when troubleshooting complex Nix issues or understanding the underlying processes in more detail.'
        trusted-public-keys: '[AI] `nix --trusted-keys` is a command in Nix Pakages Manager used to manage a list of public keys that are trusted for building and installing software from external sources. These keys belong to the builders or developers of the Nix expressions or packages, which may not be available in the default trusted Nix channels. By adding a key with `nix --trusted-keys`, users can trust and install packages signed by that key. The command accepts a file containing multiple keys or the URL of such a file for bulk addition.'
        trusted-substituters: '[AI] The `--trusted-substituters` flag in Nix is used to specify a list of trusted servers or repositories for Nix Expressway, Nix''s built-in channel for fetching and installing software packages. This flag helps ensure the security and authenticity of the packages being installed as only the specified trusted servers are allowed to provide substitutes (precompiled binary packages) for the requested packages. This is particularly useful in secure environments where it is important to limit the sources of external software.'
        trusted-users: '[AI] The `nix --trusted-users` flag is a command-line option for Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This flag allows specifying a list of trusted users whose installations and modifications are not subjected to the default sandboxing mechanisms in place with Nix''s normal build and installation process. Trusted users have elevated privileges and can bypass certain security constraints, allowing them to install packages or modify their system configuration freely without interference from Nix''s strict isolation policies. This is typically used for system administrators or other trusted parties who need greater flexibility in managing their systems with Nix.'
        use-case-hack: |-
            [AI] The `--use-case-hack` flag in Nix is an advanced configuration option used to bypass some of Nix's built-in optimizations for specific use cases, particularly when dealing with out-of-tree builds or managing custom configurations. It allows users to have more control over how Nix constructs and manages their build environments, but requires a deeper understanding of Nix's underlying system.

            In essence, this flag disables the use of the Nix store and instead lets users manage their package dependencies manually through `input` attributes in their configuration files. This can be useful for managing custom configurations or packages not available in the Nixpkgs repository. However, it also means that Nix won't handle upgrades or conflicts between packages automatically, so it requires more manual effort and increased responsibility from the user.

            The `--use-case-hack` flag is often used by experienced Nix users working on complex projects that can't be easily managed using Nix's default behaviors, but it should be approached with caution due to its potential for introducing inconsistencies and manual errors if not used correctly.
        use-registries: '[AI] The `--use-registries` flag in Nix packaging system is used to specify a list of container registries as sources for fetching Docker images referred to in a Nix expression. It enhances the default package manager behavior, allowing users to build and run applications that depend on containers from external registries, ensuring their versions are controlled by the Nix expression.'
        use-sqlite-wal: '[AI] The `--use-sqlite-wal` flag is a configuration option in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Un*x systems. It instructs Nix to use SQLite Write Ahead Logging (WAL) mode instead of the default SQLite checkpointing mechanism when creating or updating SQLite databases. WAL provides better performance for write-heavy workloads by allowing data to be written to a log file before being synced to the main database file, enabling faster commit times and reducing the likelihood of write conflicts. However, it requires more disk space as both the main database file and the WAL log file must be written simultaneously.'
        user-agent-suffix: '[AI] The `--user-agent-suffix` flag in Nix is used to specify a string that will be appended to the User-Agent string when making HTTP requests using Nix''s built-in tools like `wget`, `curl`, or `fetch-url`. This can be useful for identifying the source of requests, such as for testing purposes or when interacting with services that restrict access based on User-Agent strings. For example, `nix-build --user-agent-suffix=" MyProjectTest"` would append `" MyProjectTest"` to the User-Agent string when making requests during the build process.'
        verbose: '[AI] `nix --verbose` is a command-line option for Nix Package Manager. It increases the amount of output produced during Nix commands, providing more detailed and informative messages to help users understand the steps that Nix is taking during installation, upgrading, or other tasks. This can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues with Nix packages.'
        warn-dirty: '[AI] The `--warn-dirty` flag in Nix is used during the building or updating of Nix packages. It warns the user if they attempt to build or update a package that has unsynced changes, which could result in data loss or inconsistencies. In other words, it''s a safety measure to prevent accidental overwriting of local modifications on a package without proper backup or consideration.'
