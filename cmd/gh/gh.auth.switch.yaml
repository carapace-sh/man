documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh auth switch` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to authenticate and set the active context for a different GitHub user account or personal access token. It allows users to easily switch between multiple accounts while maintaining the confidentiality of their individual access keys. This command helps developers maintain separate workspaces associated with different repositories or organizations without having to log in and out repeatedly.'
    flag:
        hostname: '[AI] The `gh auth switch --hostname` command is used in GitHub''s git-cli (Command Line Interface) tool, `gh`, to switch between different GitHub accounts or organizations while maintaining the same local Git configuration. By providing a new hostname (a unique identifier for each GitHub instance you use), this command updates your local Git config file with the new SSH key and URLs for the given GitHub instance. This way, when you push or pull changes from repositories belonging to that account/organization, they will be authenticated using the correct credentials without having to manually change your `upstream` remote.'
        user: '[AI] `gh auth switch --user` is a command used in the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. This command is used to switch between different GitHub user accounts or personal access tokens without having to log out and log back in again. The "--user" flag specifies which account or token to use for authentication. When you run this command, you''ll be prompted to enter the username or token for the desired account, and then the CLI will remember that account for future usage until you switch to another one.'
