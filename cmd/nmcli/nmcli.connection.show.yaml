    command: '[AI] The `nmcli` (NetworkManager CLI) command `connection show` is used to display details of existing network connections configured in NetworkManager. It lists connection profiles with their UUIDs, names, types (e.g., wifi or ethernet), statuses, and various other relevant information such as the interface name, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, gateway, and DNS servers.

This command displays information about the currently active (connected) network connections.

            [AI] `nmcli` is a powerful networking management command-line tool for Linux systems. The `connection show` command is used to display details of network connections configured on the system.

            The option `--order` followed by this command modifies the output format. Specifically, it sorts the output based on the connection profiles' order of priority or their UUIDs in ascending order by default. This can help in understanding which connection profile takes precedence when multiple connections exist for a particular network interface.
