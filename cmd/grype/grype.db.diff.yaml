documentation:
    command: '[AI] `grype db diff` is a command used by Grype, an open-source vulnerability scanning tool, to compare two different database snapshots and show the differences between them. The result is a list of added, modified, or deleted vulnerabilities in the second snapshot compared to the first. This can be useful for tracking changes in vulnerability status over time or comparing the results of multiple scans.'
    flag:
        delete: '[AI] `grype db diff --delete` is a command from the Grype vulnerability scanning tool. It generates a difference report between the current and previous database state, showing only the deleted vulnerabilities or CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in the datastore. This can help track and understand which vulnerabilities have been remediated or no longer exist in the system.'
        output: '[AI] `grype db diff --output` is a command used with Grype, a vulnerability scanning tool for container images. This specific command generates a difference report between two Grype database versions or scans, displaying the added, modified, and removed vulnerabilities. The `--output` flag specifies the output format, which can be set to JSON or other formats for easy integration with other systems or tools.'
