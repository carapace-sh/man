documentation:
    command: '[AI] "Dagger" is not a standard Linux or Unix command, but rather a popular open-source dependency injection and build tool for Scala and Java projects. It generates compile-time and runtime dependencies and manages project structures to simplify application development. Dagger configuration files define the dependencies and their relationships within an application. The tool automates the build process, providing more efficient and consistent management than manual methods.'
