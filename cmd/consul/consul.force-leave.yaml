documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul force-leave` is a Command Line Interface (CLI) command for Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. This command is used to forcefully remove an agent from the Consul cluster, bypassing any grace period set for the agent. When invoked, it sends a SIGTERM signal to the agent process and if the agent does not terminate within a specified time (default is 30 seconds), Consul forcefully shuts down the agent. This command can be used when an agent is unresponsive or needs to be removed from the cluster immediately.'
    flag:
        prune: '[AI] The `consul force-leave --prune` command is a feature in Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration tool. It forcibly removes (evicts) an agent from a Consul cluster, along with its associated data, and deletes any empty or stale data centers from the cluster. This command helps to keep the Consul cluster clean by removing unresponsive or unwanted agents, reducing resource usage and improving overall performance.'
