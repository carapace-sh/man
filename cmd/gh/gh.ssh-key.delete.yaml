    command: '[AI] The `gh ssh-key delete` command is used to remove an SSH key from your GitHub account managed by GitHub for Windows or GitHub for Mac. When you run this command, it will ask for confirmation before deleting the specified key from your local SSH agent and also from your GitHub account, effectively disconnecting any GitHub repositories that were configured to use that key. This is typically used when you want to revoke access to a specific machine or user for security reasons.'
    flag:
        confirm: '[AI] The command `gh ssh-key delete --confirm` is used to permanently delete a SSH key from GitHub''s account management. The `--confirm` option is included to ensure that the user intentionally wants to delete the key after providing the necessary authentication. This action cannot be undone, so it''s crucial to double-check before executing this command. If you are certain that you want to remove a specific SSH key associated with your GitHub account, running this command will delete the corresponding private key from GitHub''s servers and revoke its access to your account.'
        "yes": '[AI] The `gh ssh-key delete --yes` command is used in GitHub''s `git-for-windows` (gh) tool to permanently delete an SSH key from your local GitHub account. The `--yes` flag confirms that you want to perform this action without any further prompts for confirmation. This can be useful if you have accidentally added a key or if the existing key needs to be replaced with a new one.'
