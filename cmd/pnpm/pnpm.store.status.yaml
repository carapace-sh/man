documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pnpm store status` is a command provided by PnPM, a package manager for JavaScript projects, to check the current state of the local and remote caches in the PnPM store. The command displays information about which packages are in the local cache, which ones are missing from the local cache but available in the remote stores, and which versions of each package are currently installed. This command helps developers ensure that they have all necessary dependencies up-to-date and readily available for their project.'
