description: Unlock swarm
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker swarm unlock` command is used to decrypt and unlock a Docker Swarm cluster''s encryption key. This command should be run on a node that has been designated as a manager node in the Swarm formation, and it requires the encrypted key file (usually named `swarm-key.yaml`) as an argument. After running this command, Swarm operations such as joining worker nodes or updating configurations can be performed securely using TLS encryption.'
