        [AI] The `get-env` command is not a standard PowerShell or cmdlet command. It seems to be a typo or an incorrect abbreviation as there isn't any built-in Windows PowerShell or Bash command with this exact name.

        To display all the current environment variables, use the following PowerShell commands instead:

        1. For local environment variables (variables accessible from the current PowerShell session): `Get-ChildItem Env:`
        2. For system-wide environment variables: `Get-ChildItem Env:\`
        3. For both local and system-wide environment variables: `Get-ChildItem -Path "Env:\" -Recurse`
        4. To display only the names of the environment variables, use: `(Get-ChildItem "Env:" -Recurse).Name`

        For Bash, use the `printenv` command to list all current environment variables.
