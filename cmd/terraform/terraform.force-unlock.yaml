    flag:
        force: '[AI] The `terraform force-unlock` command is a built-in Terraform state modification command. It is used to override Terraform''s locking mechanism and force it to apply changes to resources even if they have unsaved changes or are marked as planned to be destroyed. The `-force` flag is optional and, when used, bypasses additional safety checks that would prevent applying such changes without explicit confirmation. It''s important to note that using this command can lead to unintended consequences and potential data loss if not used carefully.'
