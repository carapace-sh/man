        [AI] The `brew update-test` command is not a valid Homebrew (MacOS package manager) command. There seems to be a confusion with the `brew update` and `brew test` commands.

        The `brew update` command is used to fetch and install the latest Homebrew formulae from the repository. It also updates your local Homebrew installation.

        The `brew test` command, on the other hand, runs tests for all installed Homebrew packages. This helps in ensuring that your installed packages are working correctly and there's no regression.
    flag:
        before: |-
            [AI] The command `brew update-test --before` is a Homebrew (a popular package manager for macOS) command used to fetch and check the latest upcoming changes to the Homebrew formulae repository without actually applying those changes.

            The `--before` option instructs Homebrew to show the differences between the current state of the formulae and the proposed changes before updating. This allows users to review the changes, understand their potential impact, and decide whether to proceed with the actual update. If the user is satisfied with the proposed changes, they can then use `brew upgrade` or `brew install` to apply the updates.
        commit: '[AI] `brew update-test --commit` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command performs an automatic update of Homebrew''s formulae (recipes for installing software), fetches the latest changes from upstream repositories, runs tests on the updated formulae to ensure their correctness, and finally commits the changes to the local Homebrew repository. The `--commit` option automatically creates a Git commit with the changes, allowing users to easily roll back if necessary.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew update-test --debug` is a Homebrew (a popular package manager for macOS) command used to perform an updated check and run tests on the latest Homebrew formulae and their dependencies, while generating extensive debug output. This command fetches new formulae from the Homebrew GitHub repository, compares local files with remote ones, installs or upgrades any changed formulae, and runs tests on those changes. The `--debug` flag enhances the output of this command by providing detailed information useful for troubleshooting.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `brew update-test --help` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `update-test` subcommand is specifically designed to run tests during the update process. When you add the `--help` flag, Homebrew displays detailed information about how to use this command. Here's what it does:

            1. `brew update-test`: Initiates an update of Homebrew and its installed packages while running tests during the update process. This is useful for developers who want to ensure their Homebrew installation is up-to-date and stable.

            2. `--help`: Displays comprehensive help information about the `update-test` command. It explains how to use the command, including available options and their usage.

            So, `brew update-test --help` provides you with detailed instructions on how to perform an updated Homebrew installation while running tests using the `update-test` command.
        keep-tmp: '[AI] `brew update-test --keep-tmp` is a Homebrew command used for updating Homebrew itself to the latest version, along with checking for and installing available software upgrades. The `--keep-tmp` option ensures that Homebrew keeps the downloaded files in the temporary directory even after the installation process is complete, which can be useful for troubleshooting or for analyzing what files would have been installed without actually performing the update.'
        quiet: '[AI] `brew update-test --quiet` is a command used in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. This command performs an automatic update check and downloads any newly available formulae or casks without installing them and with minimal output to the terminal, making the process quieter. The `--quiet` option reduces the amount of text displayed during the update process.'
        to-tag: '[AI] `brew update-test --to-tag` is a Homebrew command used to perform an automatic update of Homebrew itself, as well as checking and advancing the Homebrew Core git master to the next tag if the update was successful. This command combines both `brew update` and `brew tap update homebrew/homebrew-core --prune` (or `brew tap reSync homebrew/homebrew-core`) commands into one step, making it convenient for users to ensure their Homebrew installation is up-to-date with the latest changes.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew update-test --verbose` is a command used by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command performs an update check and downloads new formulae (Homebrew''s term for packages) without installing them. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output provided during the process to give more detailed information about what is being updated or downloaded.'
