description: restart adbd with root permissions
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `adb root` command is not a valid Android Debug Bridge (ADB) command. The term "root" refers to gaining elevated privileges or superuser access on an Android device. However, ADB itself doesn''t have a built-in rooting function. Rooting is usually achieved through custom scripts or third-party tools. Once root access is gained, you can use ADB with root permissions by adding the `su` (Superuser) binary to your PATH in an ADB shell session.'
