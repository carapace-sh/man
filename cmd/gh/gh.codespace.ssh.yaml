documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh codespace ssh` is a GitHub CLI (git-hub) command used to establish an SSH connection to a codespace, which is a lightweight development environment provided by GitHub for working on projects directly in the cloud. This command sets up and connects you to an SSH session in your active codespace, allowing you to run commands, build and test your code within that isolated environment.'
    flag:
        config: '[AI] `gh codespace ssh --config` is a command used in GitHub''s Codespaces, which allows users to configure their SSH keys for securely accessing GitHub repositories from within the codespace environment. This command sets up an SSH agent and adds the existing SSH key from your local machine to the codespace. By using `--config`, you can also customize various SSH-related settings in your codespace, such as the SSH key file path or passphrase. The primary benefit is seamless authentication for Git operations within the codespace without having to handle SSH keys separately for each session.'
        debug: '[AI] `gh codespace ssh --debug` is a command used with the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, gh. This command creates or connects to a new codespace (a lightweight development environment provided by GitHub) and establishes an SSH connection to it with debug mode enabled. The `--debug` flag increases the verbosity of the output, providing detailed information about the process, making it helpful for troubleshooting and understanding what is happening behind the scenes during the execution of this command.'
        debug-file: '[AI] `gh codespace ssh --debug-file` is a command used in the GitHub Codespaces product. It establishes an SSH connection to a Codespace environment and enables debug output by specifying a file path for storing the debug logs with `--debug-file`. This command allows developers to inspect detailed diagnostic information while using Codespace environments, which can be helpful in troubleshooting issues.'
        profile: '[AI] `gh codespace ssh --profile` is a command used in the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, `gh`. This command establishes an SSH connection to a GitHubCodespace – a lightweight development environment in the cloud – with the specified SSH config profile. It sets up the necessary infrastructure for working on a project within that environment, enabling features like pre-installed dependencies and an isolated workspace.'
        server-port: '[AI] The `gh codespace ssh` command is a GitHub Action provided by GitHub to set up an SSH connection to a codespace, which is a disposable environment for running and testing code. The `--server-port` flag specifies the port number on which the SSH server inside the codespace listens for incoming connections. When you run this command in your GitHub Actions workflow file, it sets up an SSH connection to the codespace using the specified port number.'
        stdio: '[AI] `gh codespace ssh --stdio` is a command used in the GitHub Codespaces product. It connects to a running codespace using SSH (Secure Shell) and establishes an interactive terminal session with standard input, output, and error streams transmitted over the same encrypted connection. This allows users to work directly on their codespace from their local terminal, as if they were connected via SSH to a remote server.'
