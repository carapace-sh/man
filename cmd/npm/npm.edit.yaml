When you run this command, it opens the package.json file in your default text editor, allowing you to make modifications and save them directly. After saving, `npm` checks for syntax errors before updating the local package.json file.'

        editor: '[AI] `npm edit` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). It opens the source file of a package in an editor for direct editing. The `--editor` option specifies which code editor to use for the editing session.

This command is useful when you need to make quick adjustments to a package''s source code before installing it in your project.'
