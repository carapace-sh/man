documentation:
    command: '[AI] `golangci-lint config path` is a command used with the Golang static code analysis tool, Golangci-lint. The `config path` argument specifies the location of a custom Golangci-lint configuration file. This file contains rules and settings for analyzing Go source code. Using this command allows users to apply customized linting rules beyond the default set.'
    flag:
        allow-parallel-runners: '[AI] The `--allow-parallel-runners` flag in the `golangci-lint` configuration path setting is used to enable parallel execution of lint checks across multiple Go files. This improves the efficiency of the linting process, especially for large codebases. When this option is set, `golangci-lint` will utilize multiple CPU cores or processes to run checks concurrently. Note that enabling parallel checks might increase memory usage and require more system resources.'
        allow-serial-runners: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static analyzer for Go programming language. The option `--config-path <file>` allows specifying a custom configuration file for the tool. The option `--allow-serial-runners` is used to override the default configuration and enable serial mode for multi-runner setups, meaning it will run analyses sequentially instead of in parallel. This can be useful when running analyses on a single machine or when resources are limited.'
        build-tags: '[AI] `go Lanci-lint` is a popular static code analysis tool for the Go programming language. The command `--config-path <file_path>` specifies the path to a custom configuration file for `golangci-lint`. The option `--build-tags <tags>` sets specific build tags that determine which parts of the codebase are analyzed during the linting process. Together, these options allow you to configure `golangci-lint` with custom rules and analyze specific parts of your Go project based on your development needs.'
        config: '[AI] `gołangci-lint` is a popular static code analysis tool for the Go programming language. The `--config` flag is used to specify the path to the configuration file for `gołangci-lint`. This file can be customized to define rules, suppressions, and other settings for the analysis process. By default, `gołangci-lint` looks for a configuration file named `.golangci.yml` in the current working directory. However, you can use the `--config` flag to point to an alternative or custom location for the configuration file.'
        deadline: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a static code analysis tool for Go programming language. The command `golangci-lint config path --deadline` sets the deadline configuration path for `golangci-lint`. This means specifying a file where custom rules or deadlines can be defined, allowing you to set custom linting requirements beyond the defaults provided by `golangci-lint`. The `--deadline` flag indicates that only the deadline configuration is being set in the specified path.'
        disable: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular linter tool for the Go programming language, which helps detect potential errors and enforce coding styles. The command `golangci-lint config path --disable` is used to configure it by specifying a custom configuration file path and disabling specific rules. The `--disable` flag allows you to turn off certain checks that might not apply to your project or could generate false positives, reducing the noise in the output. By combining this flag with the `config` command, you can create a custom configuration that suits your needs while still leveraging the power of golangci-lint for code analysis.'
        disable-all: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a static analyzer tool for Go language. The command `golangci-lint config path --disable-all` sets up the configuration file of `golangci-lint` to disable all rules by default when running the analysis. The `path` argument specifies the location of the configuration file.'
        dupl.threshold: |-
            [AI] `golangci-lint` is a static code analysis tool for Go language. The `--dupl.threshold` option under the `config path` setting in its configuration file (e.g., `.golangci.yml`) specifies the minimum similarity percentage for reporting duplicate code within the project.

            For instance, if you set `--dupl.threshold=80`, golangci-lint will only report duplicate functions or blocks of code with a similarity score above 80% as potential issues. This can help reduce false positives and focus on more significant duplications within your Go project.
        enable: |-
            [AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static analysis tool for Go programming language. The command `config path --enable` is used to configure its behavior by specifying a custom lint configuration file and enabling specific checks within it.

            Here's a breakdown of the parts:

            * `config`: Configure the Golangci Lint settings.
            * `path`: Specify the location of the custom configuration file. It can be a relative or absolute path to a valid Go lint config file.
            * `--enable`: Enable the specified checks in the given configuration file. This flag accepts one or more check names as arguments, allowing you to selectively enable certain checks while disabling others.

            In summary, this command allows you to customize Golangci Lint's behavior by providing a specific config file and enabling particular checks within it.
        enable-all: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static analyzer for Go code. The command `golangci-lint config path --enable-all` sets up the configuration file of `golangci-lint` to enable all available rules for linting Go projects located at the specified path. This results in a more thorough analysis and improved code quality, as it checks against a wide range of potential issues and best practices.'
        errcheck.check-blank: |-
            [AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static code analysis tool for Go programming language. The option `config path --errcheck.check-blank` is used to enable or disable the `errcheck` rule with focus on checking blank errors in Go code.

            When set to true, `errcheck` will report an error if an error value is ignored (not checked) in function calls where an error is expected as a return type. For example, when a function call with an error return type is used without proper error handling.

            Therefore, this option helps ensure that errors are handled properly in Go code, reducing the risk of potential runtime issues and improving overall code quality.
        errcheck.check-type-assertions: '[AI] The `--errcheck.check-type-assertions` option in the Golangci Lint configuration path sets up rules to check type assertions for potential errors in Go code. When enabled, it flags type assertions that may result in runtime errors if the asserted value is not of the expected type. This can help prevent unexpected behavior and improve code reliability.'
        errcheck.exclude: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a static analyzer for Go code. The `--errcheck.exclude` config flag allows excluding specific error check errors from being reported during the linting process. This can be useful when dealing with custom error handling practices or ignoring specific warnings in large projects. By providing a list of error check names to exclude, you can customize which potential issues are reported by `golangci-lint`. For example, `--errcheck.exclude="ErrNotFound,ErrBadRequest"` will exclude reporting errors named "ErrNotFound" and "ErrBadRequest".'
        errcheck.ignore: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static code analysis tool for Go programming language. The option `--errcheck.ignore` in its configuration path modifies the behavior of errcheck sublinter, which checks for errors being ignored in Go code. By using this option followed by a list of packages or source files paths, it instructs errcheck to ignore potential issues related to error handling in those specified locations. This can be useful when dealing with specific coding styles or libraries where ignoring certain warnings might be acceptable or desired.'
        exclude: '[AI] The `golangci-lint` is a static code analysis tool for Go language. The `config path --exclude` option is used to specify one or more directories or file paths that should be excluded from the linting process. This means that files and directories matched by the exclude pattern will not be analyzed by `golangci-lint`, allowing you to focus on specific parts of your codebase while excluding areas that don''t need analysis at the moment.'
        exclude-case-sensitive: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static analyzer for Go code. The `config path --exclude-cases-sensitive` option modifies the behavior of its configuration files by disabling case sensitivity when matching file paths. This means that if you specify a file path in the config file with a mixture of upper and lower case letters (e.g., "MyFile.go"), it will match both upper and lower cases (i.e., "myfile.go" or "MYFILE.go") during analysis. This can be useful when dealing with inconsistent or complex directory structures in large Go projects.'
        exclude-use-default: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static analyzer for Go code. The `config path --exclude-use-default` option is used when specifying a custom configuration file to be used instead of the default one. In this case, the `--exclude-use-default` flag prevents `golangci-lint` from using its default configuration file and forces it to only consider the specified config file during the analysis process. This can be useful when you have a team or project with specific linting rules that differ from the defaults provided by `golangci-lint`.'
        fast: |-
            [AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static analysis tool for Go programming language. The command `golangci-lint config path --fast` sets up the configuration file path for `golangci-lint` and enables the fast checking mode (--fast flag).

            The `config path` argument specifies the location of the custom configuration file, which can override default rules or add new ones. By default, `golangci-lint` uses a preset of rules, but with a config file, you can tailor the analysis to your project's needs.

            The `--fast` flag is an optimization that performs a quick scan without enabling all checks in the rule set. It still provides helpful feedback on common issues and errors, but it may not catch every potential issue in your codebase. For a more thorough analysis, you can run `golangci-lint` without the `--fast` flag.
        fix: |-
            [AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static code analysis tool for Go programming language. The `config path --fix` option is used to apply linting rules specified in a custom configuration file and automatically fix identified issues.

            When running with this flag, `golangci-lint` reads the specified configuration file (instead of using its default ruleset) and applies the defined rules to the analyzed Go source code. If any issues are detected, it attempts to automatically fix them based on the configurations provided. This makes it easier to enforce specific coding conventions and styles across a project.
        go: '[AI] `golci-lint` is a popular static analysis tool for Go programming language. The option `--config-path <path>` sets the custom configuration file path for `golci-lint`. The option `--go` specifies that the configuration file is written in Go''s `.lint.yml` format, which allows defining custom rules and priorities for specific linters. Together, these options allow users to customize the linting process according to their project requirements using a Go-specific configuration file.'
        goconst.ignore-calls: '[AI] `--goconst.ignore-calls` is a configuration option for GolangCI-Lint, a popular linter tool used in the Go programming language. This flag allows ignoring specific function calls that are reported as potential constitutional issues by the `goconst` analyzer of GolangCI-Lint. Constitutional issues refer to code smells related to type conversions and constant values. By setting `--goconst.ignore-calls`, users can exclude certain function calls from being flagged, improving the flexibility of the linting process while ensuring that non-ignored issues are still enforced.'
        goconst.match-constant: |-
            [AI] `goलангci-lint` is a popular static analysis tool for Go programming language. The configuration option `--goconst.match-constant` specifies how to match constants during linting.

            By default, Golangci-lint identifies constants based on their names. With the `--goconst.match-constant` flag, you can set it to a regular expression pattern instead. This allows matching constants with more complex naming patterns or even those without explicit names. For example, `--goconst.match-constant="^(.+)_const$"` will match any identifier ending with "_const".
        goconst.max: '[AI] `gołangci-lint` is a popular static analysis tool for Go programming language. The option `--config path --goconst.max` in its configuration file sets the maximum constant value allowed in your Go code. The value `path` specifies the location of the config file, and `--goconst.max` is the actual setting with an integer value that defines the limit for constants in your project. For instance, `--goconst.max 1024` sets the limit to 1024 for all constants in the codebase. This helps maintain consistency in constant values and improves code readability and maintainability.'
        goconst.min: '[AI] `--goconst.min` is a configuration option for GoLint, a static analysis tool for the Go programming language. It sets the minimum constant value threshold for warnings or errors. When a constant value in Go code is compared with another constant, and the difference between them exceeds this threshold, GoLint will report a warning or error. The default value of `--goconst.min` is 1, meaning that any difference between constants will trigger a warning or error. By increasing the value of `--goconst.min`, you can suppress warnings for larger constant differences in your code. For example, setting `--goconst.min=5` would only report warnings if the difference between constants is greater than 5.'
        goconst.min-len: '[AI] `--goconst.min-len` is a configuration option for Golangci Lint, a popular static analysis tool for Go programming language. This option sets the minimum length threshold for constants identified as potentially having shorter names than desired in the codebase. By default, it''s set to 2 characters. If you want to enforce stricter naming conventions, you can increase this value. For instance, setting `--goconst.min-len=3` would require all new constants to have names with at least three characters.'
        goconst.min-occurrences: '[AI] The `--goconst.min-occurrences` option in the Golang linting tool `golangci-lint` sets a minimum number of occurrences for constant definitions. This means that any constant defined in the code will only be reported as an error if it is used at least this minimum number of times. The purpose of this option is to reduce false positive errors from unused constants in large codes bases where these constants might be intentionally reused across modules or packages but not directly in the file being linted.'
        goconst.numbers: |-
            [AI] `golci-lint` is a popular static code analysis tool for Go language. The option `--goconst.numbers` under its configuration path (`config`) relates to checking constant values in Go source code for potential issues.

            When you run `golcı-lint` with this config flag, it checks whether any numeric constants are defined multiple times with the same value in your Go codebase. This could potentially lead to maintenance issues and code inconsistencies. The tool reports any such occurrences to help developers ensure consistency and prevent unintentional redundancies within their codebase.
        gocyclo.min-complexity: '[AI] `--gocyclo.min-complexity` is a configuration option for golangci-lint, which is a static code analysis tool for Go. It specifies the minimum cyclomatic complexity, a software metric indicating the number of linearly independent paths through a piece of source code, that gocyclo (a sub-lint tool focused on cyclomatic complexity) should report as an issue. A lower value results in more conservative analysis and reporting of issues, while a higher value allows for potentially less efficient but more complex code structures to go unflagged.'
        gofmt.simplify: '[AI] `--gofmt.simplify` is a flag used in the Golang linting tool `golangci-lint`. It instructs the GoFormatter component of the linting tool to apply simplifications during code formatting. These simplifications may include reducing unnecessary imports, renaming variables or constants with consistent naming, and other similar adjustments that can improve code readability and maintainability without changing semantics. The goal is to make the formatted code adhere more closely to a team''s preferred coding conventions while preserving the functionality of the existing code.'
        golint.min-confidence: '[AI] `--golint.min-confidence` is a configuration option for GolangCI-Lint, a popular static analysis tool for Go programming language. This option sets the minimum confidence level that a lint rule must meet to be run. A confidence level represents the certainty of a rule''s report, with higher confidence indicating more reliable warnings or errors. By setting this parameter, users can choose to only execute rules that they deem important or trustworthy, potentially reducing false positives and unnecessary context switching in their development workflow.'
        govet.check-shadowing: '[AI] `gołangci-lint` is a popular static analysis tool for Go programming language. The option `--config path --govet.check-shadowing` specifies the configuration file path for `govet`, which is a sub-lint tool within `gołangci-lint`. This flag enables the shadow checking feature of `govet`, which checks for variable and function name conflicts within the same package or across import packages, ensuring code consistency and avoiding unintended name collisions.'
        internal-cmd-test: |-
            [AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static analyzer for Go code. The `--config-path` option is used to specify the path to the configuration file. The `--internal-cmd-test` option is a sub-option under `--config`, which is used to enable or disable internal tests when running the linter.

            When you use `--config-path <path> --internal-cmd-test true`, it enables running Go test commands for checking lint issues within packages being tested during the linting process. This can be helpful in catching potential issues during testing, especially when working on larger projects with complex structures.

            Note that enabling this option may increase the overall time taken to run the linter as each test command needs to execute.
        issues-exit-code: |-
            [AI] `goLangci-lint` is a popular static code analysis tool for the Go programming language. The option `--issues-exit-code` controls how the tool exits when it encounters issues during analysis.

            With this option set to `1`, the tool will exit with a non-zero status code if there are any linting issues found in the analyzed Go source files. This is useful for continuous integration (CI) systems, as they can be configured to fail the build when code quality checks do not pass. When set to `0` (which is the default), the tool will continue running even with issues and report them instead.
        lll.tab-width: |-
            [AI] `golangci-lint` is a static analysis tool for Go code. The option `--config path --lll.tab-width` sets the configuration file path for Golangci-lint and specifies the tab width (`--lll.tab-width`) to be used while checking the code for style and linting issues. For instance, if you have a custom configuration file located at `/path/to/config.yaml` with specific tab width settings, you can use this command to apply it during the Golangci-lint analysis:

            ```bash
            golangci-lint --config /path/to/config.yaml -- -- -o /output.xml --lll.tab-width=4
            ```

            This command applies the settings from the `config.yaml` file and sets the tab width to 4 while checking the code for issues.
        maligned.suggest-new: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a static analyzer tool for Go language. The option `--config path --maligned.suggest-new` sets up the configuration file path for `maligned`, a specific linter within `golangci-lint`. This option enables suggesting new lint rules (i.e., checking for potential issues not covered by the existing rules) when running the analysis.'
        max-issues-per-linter: '[AI] `golcici-lint` is a popular static code analysis tool for the Go programming language. The option `--config-path <file>` sets the path to the configuration file, which can be used to customize the behavior of golangci-lint. The option `--max-issues-per-linter <number>` specifies a limit on the maximum number of issues that each linter can report for a single file or directory. This means that even if multiple linters identify issues, only up to the specified number of issues per linter will be reported. The goal is to balance code quality and development productivity by focusing on the most critical issues first.'
        max-same-issues: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static analyzer tool for Go language. The `config path --max-same-issues` option sets a limit on the number of identical lint issues reported for a single location in your codebase. This helps to reduce noise and focus on important issues, improving the effectiveness of the linting process. By default, there is no limit, but you can set a positive integer value to enforce a maximum number of same issues. For example, `--max-same-issues 5` would only report up to 5 identical issues for each location.'
        modules-download-mode: |-
            [AI] The `--modules-download-mode` flag in the Golang linter tool `golangci-lint` determines how to download and manage external dependencies for your Go project during linting.

            Here are the available options:

            1. `off` (default): No automatic module downloads are made. You need to have all required modules in your Go modules file (go.mod or go.sum) before running `golangci-lint`.
            2. `on`: If a missing dependency is found, it will be automatically downloaded using the Go Modules system during linting. This can save time and effort if you're working on a project with dynamic dependencies. However, this mode may increase the risk of unintentionally pulling in new or outdated dependencies.
            3. `download`: Similar to `on`, but it will download missing dependencies regardless of whether they are explicitly mentioned in the go.mod file or not. Use with caution as it might introduce unwanted dependencies into your project.
        new: '[AI] `go langci-lint config path --new` is a command used with the Go linter tool, `golangci-lint`. This command sets a new configuration file path for `golangci-lint`. When you run this command, it creates a new, empty `.golangci.yml` configuration file in the specified directory. You can use this feature when you want to create and manage your `golangci-lint` configuration file separately from your source code.'
        new-from-patch: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static code analysis tool for Go programming language. The command `config path --new-from-patch` sets the configuration file path based on a patch file. It means that the new configuration will be created by applying the given patch file to the existing default config instead of specifying an absolute config file path. This approach is useful when you want to modify the existing configuration while preserving its original structure, and apply custom rules or settings without rewriting the whole configuration file from scratch.'
        new-from-rev: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a static code analysis tool for the Go programming language. The `config path --new-from-rev` option is used to create a new configuration file based on the latest version of an existing configuration file in the Git repository. This can be useful when you want to use the latest settings and rules provided by the `golangci-lint` team without manually updating your configuration file each time a new release comes out. The option takes the path to the current configuration file as an argument, and creates a new file with the same name but with a suffix indicating that it is based on the latest revision in Git. For example: `golangci-lint config path myconfig.yaml --new-from-rev`.'
        no-config: '[AI] `golangci-lint --config-path --no-config` is a command used with the Golang linter tool, golangci-lint. The `--config-path` option is used to specify the location of the lint configuration file. The `--no-config` flag is used in conjunction with `--config-path` to effectively disable the use of a configuration file. This means that golangci-lint will only use its default set of rules for linting checks when run with this command.'
        out-format: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a static code analysis tool for Go language. The `config path` option specifies the location of the `golangci.yml` or `golangci.json` configuration file. The `--out-format` option determines the output format when reporting linting results, which can be set to "term" (terminal), "json", or "all". This means that you can choose to either display the results directly in the terminal, or in a JSON format, which can then be further processed by other tools.'
        path-prefix: |-
            [AI] The `--path-prefix` flag in the Golang static code analysis tool `golangci-lint` is used to specify a prefix that will be added to the file and package paths when performing linting checks. This can be useful in situations where your project's source code is organized within subdirectories, and you want to ensure that `golangci-lint` scans only the intended files or packages.

            For example, if your project has a structure like `myproject/pkg1/subpkg1`, and you want to lint only the files under `subpkg1`, you can run:
            ```css
            golangci-lint --path-prefix pkg1/subpkg1/
            ```
            This command will limit the scan to the files and packages under the specified prefix. This helps improve the accuracy of your linting checks and reduces unnecessary warnings or errors.
        presets: '[AI] `golcici-lint` is a popular static analysis tool for the Go programming language. The `config path --presets` option is used to specify a custom configuration file that contains a set of predefined lint rules, or presets, for `golangci-lint`. These presets can be created based on your team''s coding standards or best practices. When you provide this option with the path to the config file, `golangci-lint` applies these rules when analyzing your Go codebase.'
        print-issued-lines: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static code analysis tool for the Go programming language. The command `golangci-lint config path --print-issued-lines` retrieves and prints out the lines in the specified Go source file(s) where potential linting issues have been identified, based on the configured `golangci-lint` rules. This can help developers quickly locate and address code quality concerns within their Go projects.'
        print-linter-name: '[AI] The command `golangci-lint config path --print-linter-names` is used with the Golang static code analysis tool, golangci-lint. It specifies the configuration file path for golangci-lint to use, and requests that it prints out the names of the installed linters that will be run against the code being analyzed. In other words, it provides a list of the linters that will be invoked during the analysis process.'
        print-resources-usage: '[AI] The `golangci-lint config path --print-resources-usage` command is used to display the resource usage statistics of a Golang linting configuration file provided by `golangci-lint`. This tool helps ensure code conforms to coding standards, identifies errors, and provides suggestions for improvement. By running this command with the `--print-resources-usage` flag, you''ll obtain detailed information about the amount of memory and CPU resources consumed while processing the configuration file. This can be useful in understanding the performance impact of your linting ruleset and optimizing it accordingly.'
        print-welcome: '[AI] The command `golangci-lint config path --print-welcome` is used to display the welcome message of golangci-lint, a popular static code analysis tool for Go programming language. The `config path` argument specifies the location of the golangci-lint configuration file. The `--print-welcome` flag explicitly requests the welcome message to be printed upon execution. In summary, this command displays the introductory text that provides information about golangci-lint''s features and usage.'
        skip-dirs: '[AI] `gołangci-lint` is a popular static analyzer for Go language codebase. The command `config path --skip-dirs` sets up the configuration file for `gołangci-lint`, specifying one or more directories to be excluded from the linting process. This can be useful when dealing with large projects where some directories may contain code that is not meant to be linted, such as generated files or tests. The flag takes a list of directory paths as an argument and skips those directories during the analysis.'
        skip-dirs-use-default: |-
            [AI] The `golangci-lint` is a popular static analysis tool for Go programming language. The `config path --skip-dirs-use-default` flag is used to configure the behavior of `golangci-lint` when it comes to skipping certain directories during analysis.

            When this flag is set, `golangci-lint` will use its default configuration for the excluded directories instead of reading a custom configuration file. It means that any directories specified in the `exclude` section of a custom `.golangci.yml` file will be ignored and not analyzed by the tool.

            The practical implication is that, when using this flag, only those directories explicitly mentioned with the `--skip-dirs` option or defined in the default configuration will be skipped during analysis. All other directories will undergo analysis as usual.
        skip-files: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a tool used for linting Go code to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues. The command `config path --skip-files` sets the custom configuration file path for `golangci-lint`, followed by specifying one or more file patterns to be excluded from linting using the `--skip-files` flag. This allows developers to exclude specific files or directories that may not need to adhere to certain linting rules while keeping others consistent with the defined coding standards.'
        sort-results: '[AI] The `golangci-lint` is a popular static code analysis tool for Go programming language. The command `golangci-lint config path --sort-results` sets the configuration file path for `golangci-lint` and enables sorting of results. With this command, you can specify where to find the `golangci-lint.yaml` or `golangci.toml` configuration file, and the tool will return the linting results sorted in a consistent order for easier analysis and review.'
        tests: '[AI] `gołangci-lint config path --tests` is a command used with the Golang static code analysis tool, `gołangci-lint`. The `--tests` flag specifies the path to the directory containing Go test files for the project under analysis. This flag instructs `gołangci-lint` to check not only the source code files (`.go`), but also the associated test files (`*.go` in the specified tests directory) for potential issues and errors. The goal is to ensure that both production code and testing code adhere to best practices and coding standards within the project.'
        timeout: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static analysis tool for Go programming language. The option `--config-path` specifies the path to the configuration file, which can be used to customize the behavior of the tool. The option `--timeout` sets a time limit in seconds for the execution of each check within that config file. If a check takes longer than the specified timeout, it will be skipped. This can help improve the overall analysis speed and efficiency when working with large projects or multiple configuration files.'
        uniq-by-line: '[AI] `golangci-lint` is a popular static analysis tool for Go programming language. The `config path --uniq-by-line` option is used to specify the path to a custom configuration file, where each line contains unique lint rules. When this option is set, `golangci-lint` will only apply those lint rules that appear uniquely in the config file, effectively ignoring any duplicate rules across lines. This can help in managing and prioritizing specific lint checks according to your project requirements.'
        whole-files: '[AI] `golici-lint` is a popular static code analysis tool for the Go programming language. The option `--config-path <path>` specifies the path to the Go configuration files for `golangci-lint`. The option `--whole-files` instructs it to analyze entire files, rather than just individual Go source code files or packages, allowing it to check Go documentation comments and other non-code parts of the files as well.'
