description: Close merge requests
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `glab mr close` is a GitLab CLI command used to update and close a merge request in GitLab. This command fetches the latest changes from the remote repository, applies them locally, and then tries to fast-forward your local branch to match the current state of the target branch in the merge request. If successful, it updates the merge request with the latest changes and sets its status to "closed".'
