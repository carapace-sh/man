documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant reload` command is used to restart Virtual Machines or Containers managed by Vagrant. It sends a SIGTERM signal to the guest system, waits for a graceful shutdown, and then sends a SIGINT signal if necessary to force a power off. After the machine has completely shut down, Vagrant will start it back up again. This command can be useful when making configuration changes that require a full system restart.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The `vagrant reload --force` command is used to forcibly reload a Vagrant virtual machine, even if it is currently running. By default, Vagrant will only reload a VM if it is in a stopped state. The `--force` option overrides this behavior and allows the reload command to be executed regardless of the current state of the VM. This can be useful when making configuration changes that require a VM to be restarted immediately, or when the VM gets stuck in an unresponsive state and needs to be forcibly reloaded.'
        no-provision: '[AI] The `vagrant reload --no-provision` command is used to restart a Vagrant virtual machine, but without running any provisioning scripts during the process. This means that the VM will be shut down, its configuration will be saved, and then it will be brought back up with the same configuration. Provisioning scripts are used to automate the installation of software or configuration of a system after the VM is created or rebooted, so by using `--no-provision`, these scripts will not be executed during the reload process. This can be useful when making configuration changes that do not require provisioning scripts to run.'
        provision: '[AI] `vagrant reload --provision` is a Vagrant command used to restart a virtual machine and run provisioners again. This command first stops the running VM, then reinitializes its state, and finally applies any configured provisioners (such as Chef, Ansible, Shell scripts) to make desired changes before bringing up the machine once more. It is typically used when you need to update the software or configuration of a virtual machine after making changes to your provisioning files.'
        provision-with: '[AI] The `vagrant reload` command with the `--provision-with` option is used to reload a Vagrant virtual machine and re-run any provisioning scripts or configurations defined in the Vagrantfile or other provisioning tools, such as Ansible or Shell scripts. This allows you to apply updates or changes to the system without destroying and recreating the VM, keeping the configuration consistent between runs.'
