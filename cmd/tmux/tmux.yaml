documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tmux` is a terminal multiplexer that enables users to create, manage, and attach to multiple terminal sessions from a single terminal window. It allows for splitting terminal windows into panes and detaching sessions, making it ideal for running background tasks or working on multiple projects simultaneously. With `tmux`, you can easily switch between sessions and maintain terminal environments across different terminals or sessions.'
    flag:
        "2": '[AI] The `-2` flag is an option used with the `tmux` terminal multiplexer command. It stands for "two" windows in a new session by default, instead of the usual one. With this flag, tmux creates and attaches to a new session with two independently controllable windows, each displaying a different terminal pane. This can be useful when you want to run multiple commands or applications side-by-side within the same tmux session.'
        C: '[AI] The `-C` option when starting the tmux terminal multiplexer indicates that a configuration file (specified with the `-f` option if provided) should be merged with the default settings, instead of completely replacing them. This allows for customization while preserving the built-in functionality of tmux.'
        D: '[AI] The `-D` flag is an option for the Tmux terminal multiplexer when starting a new session. It stands for "detached" mode, which means that once the session is started with this flag, it will run in the background and detach from the terminal, freeing up the terminal for other use. The Tmux session continues to run in the background and can be reattached to the terminal later using the `tmux attach` command. This flag is useful when running long-running processes or scripts in a terminal session while keeping the terminal available for other tasks.'
        L: '[AI] `tmux` is a terminal multiplexer that allows managing multiple terminal sessions from a single terminal window. The `-L` flag stands for "long living" mode, which means tmux will continue running in the background even if you detach from the session (press Ctrl+B then D). It also sets up the terminal to fill the entirety of the terminal window (line and column), making optimal use of available space.'
        "N": '[AI] The `tmux` command with the `-N` option is used to create a new named session in the background. This means that `tmux` will start a new terminal multiplexer session and detach from it immediately, allowing it to run in the background. This can be useful for starting long-running processes or screen-sharing sessions without having to keep the terminal window open.'
        S: '[AI] The `-S` option in the `tmux` command is used to specify the name of the session file when creating or attaching to a new session. It overrides the default session name and allows you to save and restore your terminal sessions with a custom name. For example, `tmux new -S mysession` creates a new session named "mysession".'
        T: '[AI] The `-T` option in the `tmux` command is used to set the terminal title that will be displayed by the SSH client or the window manager. For example, `tmux new -s mysession -T "My Session: main"` creates a new `tmux` session named `mysession` with the title "My Session: main". This can help identify different sessions when viewing active processes or open terminals in a terminal multiplexer or window manager.'
        V: '[AI] The command `tmux -V` is used to display the version information of the Tmux terminal multiplexer software. It doesn''t take any arguments and simply prints out the version number, compilation options, and other relevant details such as the Git hash if built from source.'
        c: |-
            [AI] The `-c` option in the `tmux` command is used to specify the name or index of the session or window to attach to. If a session with the given name already exists, then you will be attached to that session. If not, a new session with that name will be created.

            For example:
            ```bash
            $ tmux -c mysession new
            ```
            creates a new session named "mysession". If "mysession" already exists, then you will be attached to it instead.

            You can also specify the index of an existing session or window instead of a name, by using the `-t` option followed by the window ID:

            ```bash
            $ tmux -t 0 new -s mysession
            ```
            This command creates a new window in the session with the index 0 (the first session) named "mysession".
        f: '[AI] The `-f` option when using the `tmux` command is used to force tmux to detach all sessions and exit if they are currently attached to a terminal, without asking for confirmation. This can be useful in scripts or automated workflows where you want to ensure that tmux behaves predictably. For example, you might use `tmux new -s mysession -f` to create a new session without any interactive prompts.'
        l: '[AI] The `tmux` command with the option `-l` (lowercase L) displays detailed information about the current Tamux sessions and their attributes, such as session name, status, creation time, and attached clients. It provides a long listing format for better understanding and management of multiple Tamux sessions.'
        u: '[AI] The `tmux` command with the `-u` flag is used to update or upgrade the tmux terminal multiplexer application. This flag instructs tmux to check for new versions and download or install any available upgrades if found, ensuring that you have the latest features and bug fixes.'
        v: '[AI] The `tmux -v` command is used to display the version information of Tmux, a terminal multiplexer application. When run in a terminal, it will output the Tmux version number and any additional compilation information, such as the build date or operating system.'
