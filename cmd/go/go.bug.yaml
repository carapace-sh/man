        [AI] The "go bug" command is not a valid command in Go programming language. There is no built-in Go tool or library with that name. If you meant to ask about reporting or finding bugs in Go code, there are other ways to do it:

        1. Use the `go test` command to run tests associated with your source files.
        2. Manually read and understand the error messages from the terminal or IDE when compiling or running your code.
        3. Use external tools like gdb (GNU Debugger), Delve, or Visual Studio Code's built-in debugger for more advanced debugging.
        4. Search for known issues on resources such as GitHub Issues, GoDoc, and the official Go documentation.
        5. Consult the community by asking questions on platforms like Stack Overflow or the Go subreddit.
