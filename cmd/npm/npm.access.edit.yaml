documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm access edit` command is used to edit the access levels for an npm package in the npm registry. It requires authentication with npm using the `-u` or `--user` option followed by your npm username and email, and the `-p` or `--proxy` option if you''re using a proxy server. After that, you can use the command to add or modify collaborators for your package, granting them various levels of access such as "publish" (can publish new versions), "maintain" (can manage metadata and dependencies), or "read-only" (can view package information). The changes are then submitted to npm for approval.'
