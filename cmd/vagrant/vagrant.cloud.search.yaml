documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vagrant cloud search` is a Vagrant command used to search for available boxes (pre-configured virtual machines) in the Vagrant Cloud registry. The command takes a query as an argument and returns a list of matching box names, descriptions, and providers. It helps users discover and use suitable boxes for their projects without manually browsing the Vagrant Cloud website.'
    flag:
        auth: '[AI] `vagrant cloud search --auth` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command initiates a search operation on Vagrant Cloud, which is the registry for Vagrant boxes, for box versions that match certain criteria. The `--auth` flag indicates that authentication should be handled using an existing Vagrant configuration file, allowing users to avoid having to provide their credentials each time they use the command.'
        json: '[AI] `vagrant cloud search --json` is a command used with Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This specific command is used to search for boxes (pre-configured virtual machines) on the Vagrant Cloud registry with a JSON response format. The search query is not provided in this command; it should be given as an argument before "--json". For instance, `vagrant cloud search ubuntu --json` would return a JSON object containing metadata of all available Ubuntu boxes.'
        limit: '[AI] `vagrant cloud search` is a Vagrant command used to search for boxes (pre-configured virtual machines) on the Vagrant Cloud, which is a public registry of boxes maintained by Hashicorp. The `--limit` option sets the maximum number of results to return from the search query. By default, no limit is set and all matching results will be returned. Using `--limit N` where N is a positive integer, will restrict the search results to the first N matches. This can help simplify the selection process when dealing with a large number of search results.'
        no-auth: '[AI] `vagrant cloud search --no-auth` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command searches for boxes (preconfigured virtual machines) on the Vagrant Cloud, which is a public registry of shared Vagrant boxes. The `--no-auth` flag disables the need for authentication when making the search request, meaning that no API key or other credentials are required to execute the command. This can be useful in automated scripts or for quick searches where authentication setup is not desired at that moment.'
        order: '[AI] `vagrant cloud search --order` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machines. This command searches for boxes (preconfigured virtual machines) on Vagrant Cloud, the official repository for Vagrant boxes. The `--order` option sorts the search results based on specific criteria such as popularity, rating, or name. For example, `vagrant cloud search ubuntu --order popular` would return the most popular Ubuntu boxes in the repository.'
        page: '[AI] `vagrant cloud search --page` is a Vagrant command used to search for boxes (pre-provisioned virtual machine images) in the Vagrant Cloud registry. The `--page` option specifies which page of search results to retrieve, starting from the first page with a default value of 1. This command returns up to 25 boxes per page by default, allowing you to browse through multiple pages of search results.'
        provider: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud search --provider` command is used with Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command interacts with Vagrant Cloud, a registry of box files that can be shared among the Vagrant community. The `search` sub-command is used to find available boxes (preconfigured virtual machines) based on a specific provider, such as VirtualBox or VMware. The `--provider` option specifies which provider to search for in the query. For example, `vagrant cloud search --provider virtualbox` would return a list of all publicly available VirtualBox boxes registered in Vagrant Cloud.'
        short: '[AI] `vagrant cloud search --short` is a Vagrant command used to search for available boxes (preconfigured virtual machine images) on the Vagrant Cloud registry with minimal output. The `--short` flag displays only the box names and their short descriptions, making it easier to quickly scan through the results.'
        sort-by: '[AI] `vagrant cloud search` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. The option `--sort-by` allows users to specify how the search results should be ordered. For instance, `--sort-by name` would return the results sorted alphabetically by box name, while `--sort-by rating` would sort the boxes by their ratings from highest to lowest.'
