    command: |-
        [AI] The `hostname` command is used to set or display the hostname of a system in Unix or Linux operating systems. When invoked without any arguments, it simply prints out the current hostname. However, when followed by a new hostname argument, it sets the system's hostname to that value instead. For example:

        * To print the current hostname: `hostname`
        * To set the hostname to "newhostname": `hostname newhostname`
    flag:
        aliases: '[AI] The `hostname --aliases` command is used to display any alias names associated with a system''s hostname. An alias is an alternate name for a computer or device in a network. It allows easier identification and organization within the DNS (Domain Name System) or other naming systems. By running this command, you can view the primary hostname as well as any alternative names that have been configured. This information can be helpful for network administration and troubleshooting.'
        domain: '[AI] The `hostname --domain` command in Unix-like operating systems returns the domain name part of the system''s fully qualified domain name (FQDN). It displays only the label to the right of the final period in the hostname, if present. If the system does not have an FQDN set, the command will return an empty output.'
        file: |-
            [AI] The `hostname --f` or `hostname -f` command is used in Unix-based systems to display the fully-qualified hostname (FQDN) of a system. The '--file' option is not a standard option for this command, but it can be assumed that you meant the more common `--short-form` or no option at all, since the '--file' option has no documented meaning in this context.

            When run without any options, the hostname command will print the short hostname (also known as the hostname without the domain name). With the `--short-form` option, it prints only the first part of the FQDN, up to the last dot. The fully-qualified hostname is obtained by appending the domain name to this short hostname.

            So, in summary, the hostname command with no options or with the '--short-form' option displays the short hostname, while using `hostname --f` or any other unrecognized option will likely result in an error message.
        fqdn,: '[AI] The `hostname --fqdn` command is used in Unix and Linux systems to display the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the current system. An FQDN is a complete domain name that uniquely identifies a host or a device on a computer network, consisting of multiple labels separated by dots. This command provides essential information for network administration tasks such as configuring DNS records or verifying system identity.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `hostname --help` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to display information about the hostname command. The `--help` option provides a brief explanation of how to use the command, including available options and their meanings. For instance, it might show something like:

            ```bash
            Usage: hostname [OPTION]... [HOSTNAME]
            Set the system hostname or print the current one.

            Options:
              -F FILE      Read hostname from FILE instead of /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts
              -f           Force re-read of /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts.
              -i            Print IPv4 address in addition to the hostname.
                             (Default if neither -I nor --ipv6 is given).
              ...
            ```

            This output shows the basic syntax of the command, followed by a list of available options and their brief descriptions. This information can be helpful for users who want to learn how to use the `hostname` command effectively.
        ip-addresses: '[AI] The `hostname --ip-addresses` command is a Linux utility used to display the IP addresses assigned to a given hostname or the current system''s hostname. This command queries the system for its IP addresses associated with various network interfaces, and then outputs them in a human-readable format. It can be useful when troubleshooting network connectivity issues, or when you need to identify the primary IP address of a system.'
        short: '[AI] The `hostname --short` command is a utility in Unix and Linux systems used to display the short hostname of the current system. It retrieves and prints the label part of the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) without the domain portion. For example, if the system''s FQDN is `myhost.example.com`, then running `hostname --short` would output `myhost`.'
        usage: '[AI] The `hostname` command with the `--usage` option is used to display a brief help message about how to use the `hostname` utility in Linux or Unix-like operating systems. This message includes a synopsis of the command''s usage, a description of its function, and a list of available options that can be used with it. In summary, this option provides information on how to effectively utilize the hostname command for setting or displaying the system hostname.'
        version: |-
            [AI] The `hostname --version` command is used to display information about the hostname command itself, rather than the system's hostname. The output typically includes the version number and a brief description of the utility. For example:

            ```sh
            hostname: 3.27-45.EL	(Oracle)	08/01/19 12:56:18
            ```

            This output indicates that the hostname utility is version 3.27-45.EL, built on August 1st, 2019. It also shows that this specific implementation of hostname is from Oracle. This command can be useful for checking which version of the hostname utility is installed on your system.
        yp,: '[AI] The `hostname --yp` command is used to set or display the hostname of a system and also to configure its entry in the DNS (Domain Name System) database, specifically for the Yellow Pages record. In other words, it allows you to associate a specific service or alias with a hostname. This information can be useful for other systems on a network to locate and communicate with specific services on the host system more easily.'
