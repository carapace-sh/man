documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `sleep` command is a utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that causes the executing process to pause or delay its execution for a specified amount of time. It takes the argument as the number of seconds to wait, and once the time elapses, the control is returned back to the operating system. For example, `sleep 5` would cause the script or terminal session to pause for 5 seconds before continuing execution.'
    flag:
        help: |-
            [AI] The `sleep` command in Unix-based systems is used to pause or delay the execution of a script or process for a specified amount of time. When you run `sleep --help`, it displays the help message that provides information on how to use the `sleep` command. Here's an overview of the options and usage:

            ```
            Usage: sleep [SECONDS]
                    Sleep for SECONDS seconds.

            Options:
              -h, --help             Display this help message and exit.
                  --version           Output version information and exit.
            ```

            The `sleep` command takes a single argument: the number of seconds to sleep (pause). If no argument is provided, it defaults to sleeping for 1 second. The options include `--help`, which displays the help message and `--version`, which outputs the version information.
        version: '[AI] The `sleep` command in Unix-based systems is used to pause or delay the execution of a script or process for a specified amount of time. The `--version` option is used with the `sleep` command to display the version and other relevant information about the installed sleep utility, including the compilation date, operating system, and version number. This can be helpful in determining if your system has the latest version of the utility or troubleshooting compatibility issues.'
