            [AI] The command `tsh db connect --db-user` is a part of the Tectonic (now DrivenData) CLI tool used to manage and interact with databases in Kubernetes environments. This specific command establishes a connection between your local machine and a target database using the provided database user credentials. Here's a breakdown:

            - `tsh`: This is the name of the Tectonic Shell (TSH) CLI tool, which is used to manage various resources in Kubernetes environments, including databases.
            - `db`: This is the subcommand that specifies that we want to interact with a database.
            - `connect`: This is the specific action we're taking, which establishes a connection between our local machine and the target database.
            - `--db-user`: This flag provides the database user credentials to connect to the target database using the format `USER:PASSWORD@DATABASE_ENDPOINT`. For example: `myusername:mypassword@mysql-database.default.svc.cluster.local`.
