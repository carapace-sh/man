    -q, --quiet: Suppress verbose output
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker push` is a command used to transfer an image from a local Docker registry to a remote registry or Docker Hub. After building an image locally, you can use this command to share it with other systems or make it publicly available. It requires authentication to the remote registry and takes the image name and tag as arguments. For example: `docker push username/repository:tag`.'
    flag:
        all-tags: '[AI] The `docker push --all-tags` command is used to push all existing tags of a Docker image from your local machine to a remote registry or container repository. When you run this command, Docker will scan through all the images on your local system that have been built and tagged, and then it will attempt to push each tag to the specified registry using the base image tag as the default. This can save time when you want to distribute multiple versions of an application with a single command.'
        disable-content-trust: '[AI] `docker push --disable-content-trust` is a command used in Docker to push an image to a registry without validating the image''s content against the signed manifest in the local `trusted-signatures.json` file. This flag disables the content trust feature, which is designed to ensure the integrity of images during transfer and storage by comparing their contents against known signatures. When using this command, Docker skips the verification process and pushes the image directly to the registry. It''s essential to be cautious when using this command, as it potentially opens up the risk of pushing and receiving malicious or tampered images.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `docker push --quiet` command is used to upload a Docker image to a registry without displaying progress bars or other output. This can be useful when running automated scripts, as it prevents potential interference with terminal output in the script''s execution. The quiet flag (--quiet) ensures that Docker only displays errors during the image push process.'
