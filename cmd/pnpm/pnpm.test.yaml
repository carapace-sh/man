documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pnpm test` is a command used with PNPM (Parcel NPM), a package manager that provides faster and more efficient package installation than npm or yarn. This specific command runs tests defined in a project''s test configuration file, such as Jest''s `jest.config.js`, using the installed testing framework. The output provides details about tests executed, including successes, failures, and errors.'
    flag:
        changed-files-ignore-pattern: '[AI] The `pnpm test --changed-files-ignore-pattern` command is used with the PnPM package manager for running tests in a Node.js project. The `--changed-files-ignore-pattern` option allows specifying a regular expression pattern to ignore certain files when determining which files have been changed and should be retested. This can be useful when testing large projects or when only wanting to test specific files, as it helps reduce the number of unnecessary tests run and saves time.'
        filter: '[AI] `pnpm test --filter` is a command used with PnPM, a package manager for Node.js projects. This command runs only the tests specified by the filter argument. The filter can be a regex pattern that matches the test file names or the names of specific tests or test suites. For example, `--filter=integration/*` would run only the tests with "integration" in their file name. This is useful for running a subset of tests, reducing the testing time and resources required.'
        filter-prod: '[AI] `pnpm test --filter-prod` is a command used with pnpm, a package manager for Node.js projects. This command runs tests with the Jest testing framework (often used in Node.js projects) but only executes tests marked with the Jest `--mode=production` or `--testMatch(/__tests__/*.js/)` flags. These tests are typically focused on checking the behavior of a project''s production code.'
        test-pattern: '[AI] `pnpm test --test-pattern` is a command used with pnpm, a package manager for Node.js projects. This command runs tests in a project using the given test runner (usually Jest or Mocha), but with the added option of specifying one or more test file patterns using the `--test-pattern` flag. This allows running only specific tests based on their filenames or locations. For instance, `--test-pattern="**/*.spec.js"` would run all files ending with ".spec.js" as tests. This can save time and resources by excluding unnecessary tests during development or continuous integration processes.'
