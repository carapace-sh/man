description: Resets stack selection from the current workspace
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pulumi stack unselect` is a command used in Pulumi, an infrastructure deployment and management platform, to remove the default stack selection for a project. When you work with multiple stacks within a single Pulumi project, setting the default stack helps Pulumi know which stack to target when deploying or managing resources. However, there are instances where you might want to switch between different stacks without setting one as the default. In such cases, `pulumi stack unselect` comes in handy. It simply removes any previously set default stack for the project, allowing you to manually select a stack every time you run Pulumi commands.'
