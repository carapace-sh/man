documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `ts` command is short for TypeScript compiler. It''s used to compile and transpile TypeScript source code into JavaScript that can be run in a browser or node.js environment. This command typically takes a list of files or directories as arguments, and it outputs the generated JavaScript files in the same directory structure as the input files with `.js` extensions by default. To use it effectively, you need to have Node.js and TypeScript installed on your system.'
    flag:
        i: '[AI] The `ts` command with the `-i` option is used in Unix or Linux systems for parsing and displaying timestamps. The `-i` flag indicates that the input to the command is a file containing timestamps (rather than a stream of timestamps from the terminal). When used together, the `ts -i` command reads timestamps from a file line by line, interpreting each timestamp as Unix epoch time or an ISO-8601 formatted string, and outputs them in the desired format.'
        m: '[AI] The `ts` command with the option `-m` is used in Unix or Linux systems for displaying timestamps in a human-readable format. The `-m` option stands for "minute" and causes the output to show the year, month, day, and time including minutes. For example, `ts -m -I %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:SS` will display the timestamp as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".'
        r: '[AI] The `ts` command with the option `-r` is used in Unix-based systems for replaying a timeshifted input, usually from a tape or a file. The `ts` command reads timestamps and associated data from an input stream, and when used with the `-r` flag, it reapplies those timestamps to the standard output or another output file, maintaining the original order and timestamp information. In other words, `ts -r` is for restoring the original time information during data replay.'
        s: '[AI] The `ts` command with the `-s` option in Unix or Linux is used to print the current timestamp in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS". The `-s` stands for "single" or "simple", indicating that only the timestamp should be displayed, without any additional information such as the timezone or the clock format.'
