    command: '[AI] `xdotool getwindowgeometry` is a command-line tool for interacting with the X window system in Unix-based environments. Specifically, this command returns the size and position information (width, height, x-coordinate, y-coordinate) of a window identified by its ID or title. It outputs this data as a set of integers that can be parsed and used by scripts for automation purposes.'
    flag:
        shell: |-
            [AI] `xdotool getwindowgeometry --shell` is a command-line tool used in Linux and Unix systems for interacting with graphical user interface (GUI) elements programmatically. The `getwindowgeometry` subcommand retrieves the geometric properties of a window, such as its width, height, x and y coordinates on the screen, and monitor it is attached to.

            The `--shell` option specifies that the command output should be formatted for use in shell scripts. When run, this command returns a string containing the window's geometry information, which can then be used in further scripting or processing. The format of the string output is as follows: `<width>x<height>+<x>+<y>`, followed by the monitor index in the form `@<monitor_number>`. For example, a window with width 800 pixels, height 600 pixels, located at the coordinates (50, 20) on monitor number 1 would be represented as:

            `800x600+50+20@1`
