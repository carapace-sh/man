    command: '[AI] `tmux show-options` is a TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) command used to display the current settings and options of the TMUX environment. It shows the values of various configuration variables, key bindings, and other options without modifying them. This command provides useful information for understanding and customizing your TMUX setup.'
    flag:
        A: '[AI] The `tmux show-options -A` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to display all current session options in a format that can be easily parsed by scripts or other programs. The `-A` flag indicates that all options should be shown, rather than just the value of a specific option. This command provides an output in key=value format, allowing for easy parsing and manipulation of TMUX session settings.'
        H: '[AI] The `tmux show-options -H` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to display the current session and window horizontal (top and bottom) title bar settings. This means it shows the text currently displayed on the top and bottom bars of each window within the active TMUX session. The output provides a quick way to check or set the titles, which can include things like session name, progress indicators, and other custom information.'
        g: '[AI] `tmux show-options -g` is a Tmux command that displays the current global session and window options in a formatted way. The `-g` flag stands for "global", meaning it applies to the entire Tmux environment rather than just the current window or pane. This command provides an overview of various Tmux settings, including window numbering mode, mouse mode, status bar style, and more. It''s helpful for quickly checking your Tmux configuration or comparing options across different sessions.'
        p: '[AI] `tmux show-options -p` is a Tmux command that displays the current session options in a brief format as a single line output. The `-p` option stands for "pager mode" which means the output will be printed to the standard output without pagination, making it suitable for further processing or redirection to other commands. This command allows users to quickly check and record their Tmux session settings.'
        q: '[AI] `tmux show-options -q` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to display the current options of the Tmux session or the global defaults without any commentary or extra formatting. The `-q` flag stands for quiet mode, meaning that only the raw output will be displayed, without any additional messages or prompts.'
        s: '[AI] The `tmux show-options -s` command is used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to display the current session options. The `-s` argument specifies that only the options for the current session are to be displayed. This can be helpful for understanding and modifying the settings of your Tmux sessions.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux show-options -t` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to display the current options for the named window or pane target. The "-t" option specifies the target, which can be a window number or name, or a pane ID. The output shows various options like mode-keys, mouse, and status bar, with their current values.'
        v: '[AI] `tmux show-options -v` is a TMUX command that displays all current session options with their values in a verbose format. The `-v` flag increases the verbosity of output, providing more detailed information.'
        w: '[AI] `tmux show-options -w` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that displays the current window option settings in a wide format. The `-w` flag makes the output wider, displaying each option on a new line with its key binding and value. This can be useful for quickly checking or modifying specific window options within the Tmux environment.'
