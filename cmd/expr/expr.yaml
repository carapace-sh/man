    command: '[AI] The `expr` command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems is a simple tool used for performing arithmetic and string manipulation expressions directly from the command line. It accepts an expression as an argument, evaluates it, and returns the result as output. For example, `expr 5 + 3` would return `8`. It can also handle more complex expressions involving variables, functions, and logical operators. However, its functionality is limited compared to full-fledged programming languages like C or Python.'
