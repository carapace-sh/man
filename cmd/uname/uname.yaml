    command: '[AI] The `uname` command is a utility in Unix and Linux operating systems that displays essential information about the system, such as its name (usually the hostname), the kernel name, the release, the version, the architecture, and other relevant details.

            [AI] `uname` is a command-line utility in Unix and Linux systems used to display system information. The option `--all` or `-a` provides comprehensive output, displaying information about the operating system, hardware platform, and processor architecture. This includes:

            * Operating system name, release, and version.
            * Hardware name, node name, and machine hardware.
            * Processor(s) type and number, hard ware concurrency level.
            * Operating System kernel name and release.
            * Kernel build date.
            * Localization information.
            * Processor(s) topology and cache information.
        hardware-platform: '[AI] The `uname` command is a utility in Unix and Linux operating systems that provides various system information. The `--hardware-platform` option specifically displays the hardware platform or machine name as reported by the kernel. This can include information such as the processor architecture (e.g., x86, arm), the type of system (e.g., PC, server), and any vendor-specific identification strings. For example, `uname --hardware-platform` on an Intel x86 system might output "x86_64".'
        help: |-
            [AI] `uname` is a Linux command used to display system information. The option `--help` provides a brief summary of the available sub-commands and their usage. For example:

            ```
            $ uname --help
            Usage: uname [-aAMrsxz] [name]
               or: uname -i [name]
               or: uname -p [name]
               or: uname -s [name]
               or: uname -v [name]
               or: uname --help

            Print system information.

            The following options are supported:

              -a           All information that can be obtained using the -a, -m, -r, -v and -s
                           options together.
              -M            Machine hardware name (e.g. x86_64).
              -m            Machine name (e.g. Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2100 CPU @ 3.10GHz)
              -r            Kernel release (e.g. 5.4.0-47-generic)
              -v            Kernel version (e.g. #62-Ubuntu SMP Wed Mar 31 18:56:49 UTC 2021)
              -s            Operating system name (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS).
              -p            Processor (e.g. x86_64 or i686).
              -x            Machine bytes in hexadecimal (e.g. 7865737472612073657276616C2773206163746F72).
              -z            Operating system bytes in hexadecimal (e.g. 5573696E672D426F6F747970652D4C696E65642043616E6E6574).
            ```
        kernel-name: '[AI] `uname` is a command-line utility in Unix and Linux operating systems used to display system information. The option `--kernel-name` specifically returns the name of the Linux kernel without the version number. For example, if your system''s kernel is named "5.10.12", running `uname --kernel-name` would output only "5.10".'
        kernel-release: '[AI] The `uname` command with the option `--kernel-release` displays the version and release information of the Linux kernel currently running on a system. In other words, it provides the name and description of the Linux kernel version, such as "5.4.0-91-generic" or "4.9.26-ckt31-1.4-gentoo". This information can be useful for identifying the specific version of the Linux kernel in use and checking for updates or compatibility with certain applications or configurations.'
        kernel-version: '[AI] The `uname` command with the option `--kernel-version` displays the version of the Linux kernel currently running on the system. It provides essential information about the operating system, such as the kernel name, release, machine hardware name, and other details, but focusing only on the kernel version. This version number can help in identifying the specific version or release of the Linux kernel in use, which might be necessary for troubleshooting or compatibility checks with software or hardware.'
        machine: '[AI] The `uname` command with the option `--machine` or simply `-m` in some systems, displays the machine or processor architecture of the operating system. For instance, it might return values like x86\_64, i386, armv7l, powerpc64le, etc., depending on the specific CPU architecture the OS is running on.'
        nodename: '[AI] The `uname` command with the `--nodename` option is used in Unix and Linux systems to display only the hostname of the machine without any other identifying information such as operating system name or release. This can be particularly useful when working with multiple machines with different operating systems, but where you only need to know their hostnames for scripting or automation purposes.'
        operating-system: '[AI] The `uname` command is a utility in Unix and Linux operating systems that provides information about the system. The option `--operating-system` or simply `-s` displays the name of the operating system. For example, "Linux Ubuntu 20.04" or "Darwin Kernel Version 19.6.0: Darwin Kernel Cargo Build v19.6.0". This information is useful for identifying the specific OS version being used on a system.'
        processor: '[AI] The `uname` command with the option `--processor` or just `-p` displays the name of the processor architecture used by the operating system. For instance, it might return values like `x86_64`, `i386`, `armv7l`, or `powerpc64le`. This information can be useful for identifying the specific hardware platform that a Linux system is running on.'
        version: |-
            [AI] The `uname` command with the `--version` option is used to display information about the operating system kernel, specifically its name, release, version, and other system-specific details. This command is a standard utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems, including Linux distributions. By running `uname --version`, you'll get an output that looks similar to this:

            ```bash
            Linux <your_system_name> 5.4.0-96-generic #123-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 22 17:23:38 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
            ```

            In the example above, `Linux` is the operating system name, `<your_system_name>` is the hostname or the current system's name, `5.4.0-96-generic` denotes the kernel version, and the rest of the lines provide additional details like the build date and architecture.
