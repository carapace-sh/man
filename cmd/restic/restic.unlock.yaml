    command: |-
        [AI] `restic unlock` is a command used in the data backup and synchronization tool, restic. This command is utilized to decrypt and unlock previously encrypted backups. When you create encrypted backups using restic, each backup file is encrypted with a passphrase. To access the data within these encrypted files, you must first unlock them with `restic unlock`.

        This command takes one required argument which is the path to the encrypted repository or the encrypted backup file that needs to be unlocked. Additionally, it requires the passphrase to decrypt the data. Once the command is executed successfully, the specified repository or backup file will be unlocked and ready for access or restoration.
    flag:
        remove-all: '[AI] The `restic unlock` command is used in the data backup and sync tool, `restic`. The `--remove-all` option tells `unlock` to remove all encrypted files that were previously locked by this specific key or passphrase. This action removes the encryption from these files, effectively decrypting them and making their unencrypted contents accessible again. Use this command carefully as the decrypted data will be in plain text and could potentially expose sensitive information if used on the wrong data.'
