documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git stash apply` is a Git command used to apply changes made on the staging area or in the working directory and save them as a stash, which can be later applied back to the current branch. When you run `git stash apply`, Git applies the most recent stash and brings its contents into the working directory and the staging area, allowing you to review and commit the changes. Note that applying a stash does not create a new commit; use `git stash apply --index` or `git stash apply --keep-index` if you want to preserve the current changes in your index.'
