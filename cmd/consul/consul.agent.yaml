    command: '[AI] The `consul agent` is a command-line utility for Consul, an open-source distributed computing platform. It''s used to bootstrap and join agents in a Consul cluster, register services, check health status, and enable service discovery and configuration management. Once started with this command, the Consul agent becomes part of the Consul ecosystem, communicating with other agents to maintain the consistent state of the service registry.'
    flag:
        advertise: '[AI] The `--advertise` flag in Consul Agent is used to configure the node''s registration name and address with the Consul service discovery and configuration management platform. By default, an agent uses its hostname and IP address for registration. When using the `--advertise` flag, you can specify a different name and/or IP address that will be used for service discovery. This can be useful in cases where the hostname or IP address assigned to an agent might not be desirable for external communication with other services or clients. The flag takes one or two arguments: the first argument is the registration name, and the second argument (optional) is the registration address. For example, `consul agent --advertise-name myservice --advertise-addr 192.168.0.100` would register the agent with Consul as "myservice" and make it available at IP address "192.168.0.100".'
        advertise-wan: '[AI] The `--advertise-wan` flag is a command-line option used with Consul Agent, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. With this flag set, the Consul agent will advertise its registered services over the WAN (Wide Area Network) interface in addition to the default local network interface. This allows remote nodes on the Internet to discover and connect to the services running on the agent machine.'
        allow-write-http-from: '[AI] The `--allow-write-http-from` flag in Consul Agent relates to its HTTP interface. With this flag, the Consul Agent permits writes to its HTTP API from specified sources over the network. It enhances security by limiting access only to trusted IP addresses or domains to modify the configuration and data stored in Consul. By default, write access is disabled for the Consul Agent''s HTTP interface.'
        alt-domain: |-
            [AI] The `--alt-domain` flag in the Consul Agent command modifies how the agent identifies and registers itself with the Consul service discovery platform. Specifically, it sets an alternative domain name for the agent's registration instead of using the default one based on its hostname or IP address.

            This can be useful when agents need to register under a specific domain name that is different from their actual hostname, allowing for more fine-grained control over service discovery and easier management of multi-domain environments. For example, you may want all your web services to have a consistent "example.com" domain suffix. In such cases, the `--alt-domain` flag allows you to configure this behavior.
        bind: '[AI] The `--bind` flag in Consul Agent''s configuration is used to specify IP addresses and ports for Consul services to listen on, overriding automatic discovery. It can be set to bind to a specific interface or to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses with their respective ports. The format is `--bind <interface>:<port> [<ipv6-address>:<ipv6-port>]`. Multiple flags can be used for multiple interfaces or services if needed. For example, `--bind 192.168.0.5:8301 --bind :::8500` binds the HTTP and DNS services to interface with IPv4 address 192.168.0.5 on port 8301 and to IPv6 address and port :::8500, respectively.'
        bootstrap: '[AI] The `consul agent --bootstrap` command is used to start a new Consul agent node in a Consul cluster with the bootstrap expectation. This means that the node will take on the role of a server and leader in the initial stage of forming a new Consul cluster. When an agent is started with the `--bootstrap` flag, it will attempt to join an existing cluster if one is discovered during its startup process, but if no other servers are found, it will create a new cluster by becoming the first server. This flag is typically used when setting up a new Consul datacenter or site, allowing for the formation of a new consistent and highly available service discovery and configuration management system.'
        bootstrap-expect: '[AI] The `--bootstrap-expect` flag in the Consul Agent command line tool sets the number of expected nodes to join a new Raft cluster during its bootstrapping process. This flag helps ensure that a consistent number of nodes form the initial membership of the Raft cluster, which is crucial for achieving consensus and high availability in a distributed system like Consul. When starting a new Consul agent as part of a Raft cluster, specifying an appropriate value for `--bootstrap-expect` helps ensure successful cluster formation.'
        check_output_max_size: '[AI] The `--check-output-max-size` flag in the Consul Agent command is used to configure the maximum size (in bytes) of output that Consul will return when running checks. By default, Consul does not limit the output size, but setting this flag can help prevent large amounts of data from being generated unnecessarily, which can improve performance and reduce network traffic.'
        client: '[AI] The `consul agent --client` flag is used when starting the Consul agent with the client mode enabled. In this mode, the agent does not discover or register itself with the Consul server, instead it acts as a Consul client, allowing it to interact with a remote Consul server for service discovery, key-value storage, and other functionality provided by Consul. This flag is useful when running agents in environments where they should not register themselves as services or where there is already a Consul server present to handle registration.'
        config-dir: '[AI] The `flag "consul agent --config-dir"` in Consul is used to specify a directory where custom configuration files for Consul Agent should be placed. When the agent starts up, it will read these files and apply any custom configurations they contain. This flag is useful when you need to override default settings or add custom scripts for the Consul Agent.'
        config-file: '[AI] The `consul agent --config-file` flag is used with the Consul agent, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration management, and orchestration. This flag allows users to specify a custom configuration file instead of using the default one. The configuration file (in JSON format) contains settings that control various aspects of the Consul agent''s behavior, such as data centers, bind address, server addresses, encryption keys, and more. By providing a custom config file with this flag, users can tailor the Consul agent to their specific use case and environment.'
        config-format: '[AI] The `flag "consul agent --config-format"` in the Consul Agent refers to specifying the format of the configuration file used to start the Consul Agent service. The default format is HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language), but other formats like TOML or JSON can be used as alternatives. Providing this flag ensures that the Consul Agent uses the specified configuration format while starting up, enabling flexibility and consistency with the organization''s configuration management needs.'
        data-dir: '[AI] The `--data-dir` flag in the Consul Agent command sets the directory where Consul will store its data. This includes configuration files, keys and values stored in the Key/Value store, and other persistent data. When starting the agent, any existing data in this directory will be loaded, and any changes made to the data will be saved here.'
        default-query-time: '[AI] The `--default-query-time` flag in Consul Agent is used to configure the default time duration for various Consul queries, such as health checks and service discovery. It sets a global timeout value for these queries, beyond which they will be considered failed if no response is received. This can help ensure that applications are not unnecessarily marked as unavailable due to slow or unresponsive upstream services. The value is typically set in seconds.'
        dev: '[AI] `consul agent --dev` is a command used in the Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. The `--dev` flag enables the development mode for the Consul agent, which provides faster service registration and discovery updates at the expense of increased resource usage and potentially less stable behavior compared to the production mode. This flag is useful during local development or testing environments where quick iterations are required.'
        disable-host-node-id: '[AI] The `consul agent --disable-host-node-id` flag is used with the Consul agent, an open-source service discovery and configuration management tool. When this flag is set, it disables Consul from automatically generating a unique node ID based on the hostname or MAC address of the server, allowing administrators to manually specify a node name for the agent in the Consul client config file. This can be useful in environments where consistent node naming is required across multiple servers or when working with virtual machines or containers whose identities may change frequently.'
        disable-keyring-file: '[AI] The `--disable-keyring-file` flag for the Consul Agent is used to prevent Consul from using a keyring file for storing and managing encryption keys. When this option is set, Consul will not look for or use a keyring file during startup or operation. This can be useful in environments where you want to manage your encryption keys outside of Consul, or if you prefer to handle encryption keys using other tools or methods.'
        dns-port: '[AI] The `--dns-port` flag in the Consul Agent command refers to configuring the Consul agent to run a DNS server on a specified port number, in addition to its other functions like service discovery and key-value store. This allows Consul to act as a DNS server for service names registered with it, enabling clients to resolve those names to their IP addresses using standard DNS queries.'
        domain: '[AI] The `--domain` flag in the Consul Agent command is used to specify the DNS domain name for service discovery and registration. With this flag, you can set a custom domain for your services, enabling easier discovery and access through Consul''s built-in DNS server. This configuration helps streamline communication between services and improves overall infrastructure management.'
        enable-local-script-checks: |-
            [AI] The `consul agent --enable-local-script-checks` flag is used with the Consul agent, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This flag enables local script checks in the Consul agent's health checking mechanism.

            Local script checks allow users to define custom scripts that can be executed periodically by the Consul agent to determine the health of a service. These scripts can perform various checks on the system, application, or network level and report their results back to Consul. The flag enables this functionality, ensuring that the Consul agent runs these checks alongside the default ones for reporting accurate and comprehensive health information.
        enable-script-checks: '[AI] The `consul agent --enable-script-checks` flag is used with the Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. Enabling script checks means that Consul will scan scripts (configured in the `scripts` directory of the `agent.hcl` file) for security vulnerabilities using Clingham Firms'' OpsSecurity scanner. This helps to ensure the security of your infrastructure by identifying and alerting you to any potentially risky scripts running on your Consul-managed agents.'
        encrypt: '[AI] The `consul agent --encrypt` flag is used when starting the Consul agent, an open-source service discovery and configuration management tool by Hashicorp. This flag enables encrypted communications between different Consul components such as agents, servers, and clients. By default, Consul uses HTTP API and DNS gossip to exchange data among its components. Enabling encryption with `--encrypt` ensures secure data transmission over TLS/SSL, adding an additional layer of security to the Consul cluster.'
        grpc-port: '[AI] The `flag "consul agent --grpc-port"` is a configuration option used with the Consul agent when it''s run as a service. This flag sets the port number for the gRPC interface that Consul exposes. gRPC is an open-source high-performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework developed by Google. Clients can connect to this interface using the specified port number to interact with the Consul agent for service discovery, configuration, and other functionalities.'
        hcl: '[AI] `consul agent --hcl` is a command used with the Consul agent, which is a part of Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management solution. The `--hcl` flag enables the usage of HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) files as input for configuring the Consul agent. HCL is a simple, declarative language that allows easy configuration of various components within Consul. By passing the `--hcl` flag followed by the path to an HCL file, you can customize various aspects of the Consul agent''s behavior without having to manually modify individual configuration options.'
        http-port: '[AI] The `--http-port` flag for Consul Agent is used to configure the HTTP listening port number for the Consul agent service. By default, it is set to 8500, but you can change this value by specifying a different port number with this flag during agent installation or configuration. This allows you to customize the agent''s network accessibility and potential exposure to external threats.'
        https-port: '[AI] The `--https-port` flag in the Consul Agent command line interface is used to specify the HTTPS listening port for the Consul agent service. By default, Consul listens on HTTP and HTTPS on ports 8500 and 8541, respectively. However, users can override these defaults by using this flag to set a custom HTTPS port number during the agent installation or configuration. This is useful when running Consul in environments where other services may be using the default ports, or for increased security by using a non-standard listening port.'
        join: '[AI] `consul agent --join` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. This command instructs a Consul agent to connect and register itself with a Consul server or cluster. The agent will become a member of the consul datacenter, enabling it to participate in service discovery and configuration synchronization with other agents and clients. The `--join` flag specifies the addresses of one or more servers or clusters that the agent should attempt to join.'
        join-wan: '[AI] The `flag "consul agent --join-wan"` is used with the Consul agent, which is a tool from Hashicorp for service discovery and configuration management. The flag enables the Consul agent to join a Consul datacenter using its Wide Area Network (WAN) interface. This means that the agent can connect to other agents or servers in different locations over the internet, allowing for distributed service discovery and configuration across multiple data centers.'
        log-file: '[AI] The `consul agent --log-file` flag is used to configure Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool, to write its log output to a specific file instead of the standard output or error streams. This can be helpful for centralizing logs, enabling longer retention periods, or for analyzing logs more easily using tools like Logrotate or Splunk. The flag takes the file path as an argument. For example: `consul agent --log-file=/var/log/consul/agent.log`.'
        log-json: '[AI] `consul agent --log-json` is a command used with the Consul agent, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. The `--log-json` flag changes the logging output format to JSON, allowing for easier parsing and analysis of log data. This can be useful in production environments or for advanced monitoring and troubleshooting.'
        log-level: '[AI] The `--log-level` flag in Consul Agent commands sets the log level for Consul''s output. Log levels determine the severity of messages that are displayed, with options ranging from `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, to `critical`. A lower log level (e.g., `debug`) displays more detailed information, while a higher log level (e.g., `critical`) only shows error messages and above. By default, Consul Agent logs at the `info` level.'
        log-rotate-bytes: '[AI] The `consul agent --log-rotate-bytes` flag is used to configure Consul, a service discovery and configuration management tool, to rotate its logs when they reach a certain size in bytes. This helps manage log file growth and maintain an appropriate log retention policy. When this flag is set, Consul will rotate its logs based on the specified number of bytes instead of the default time-based rotation.'
        log-rotate-duration: '[AI] The `--log-rotate-duration` flag in Consul Agent is used to configure the duration for which Consul retains logs before rotating and creating new log files. This helps manage log file size and keep them from becoming too large, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot issues. By default, Consul keeps logs for 7 days before rotating. You can use this flag to set a custom duration in the format `[number]d` or `[number]h`, where `d` represents days and `h` hours. For example, `--log-rotate-duration 30d` would keep logs for 30 days before rotating.'
        log-rotate-max-files: '[AI] The `--log-rotate-max-files` flag in the Consul Agent command rotates and manages the maximum number of log files for the Consul Agent. It helps in maintaining a manageable log file size and ensures that old logs are not taking up unnecessary disk space. By default, it keeps 10 log files and rolls over the oldest one when the limit is reached. This flag can be used with other log-related flags like `--log-file` to specify the location of the log file.'
        node: '[AI] The `consul agent --node` command is used to start the Consul agent in node mode. Consul is a service discovery, configuration, and orchestration tool. In node mode, an agent registers itself as a member of a Consul cluster and participates in service discovery, key-value storage, and other Consul functions. The flag `--node` instructs the Consul agent to start in this configuration.'
        node-meta: '[AI] The `consul agent --node-meta` flag is used with the Consul agent, an open-source service discovery and configuration management tool. When this flag is provided during agent initialization, it allows for passing key-value pairs as metadata associated with that node in the Consul catalog. These metadata keys and values are then accessible through the Consul API or CLI commands, enabling users to assign custom labels, tags, or other data to nodes in the Consul cluster. This information can be utilized for various purposes such as filtering services based on their metadata or configuring infrastructure dynamically according to node properties.'
        non-voting-server: |-
            [AI] The `consul agent` is a component of Hashicorp's Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. When run with the `--non-voting-server` flag, it configures the agent to join a Consul cluster as a follower node rather than a voting server.

            In a Consul cluster, voting servers are responsible for maintaining consensus among nodes about the state of the service registry and configuration data. Non-voting servers, also called clients or agents, rely on the voting servers to provide this functionality. The `--non-voting-server` flag instructs the agent to assume this role within the cluster.

            By configuring a node as a non-voting server, you can reduce the resource requirements for that node and distribute the workload across multiple nodes in your Consul deployment. It is also useful when running agents on nodes with limited resources or when you want to maintain high availability by ensuring that there are always voting servers available in the cluster.
        pid-file: '[AI] The `--pid-file` flag for Consul''s Agent is used to specify a file where Consul will write its process ID (PID). This can be helpful in managing and monitoring Consul as a background service. When started with this option, Consul will create the specified file at the beginning of its execution and write its PID into it. Additionally, the `consul` command provides an `agent list` subcommand which, when used with the `--pid-file` argument, can be used to check the status of Consul agents by reading their respective PID files.'
        primary-gateway: '[AI] The `flag "consul agent --primary-gateway"` is a configuration option for Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This flag designates the Consul agent as the primary server in a Consul cluster, which means it will accept Raft election votes and will become the leader if the current leader goes down. The primary server is responsible for storing the entire data set of the Consul service registry and maintaining the consistency of the data among all members in the cluster.'
        protocol: |-
            [AI] The `--protocol` flag in the Consul Agent command refers to the communication protocol used between the Consul agent and the Consul server. Consul supports two main communication protocols: HTTP and gRPC.

            When using the HTTP protocol, Consul Agent communicates with the server over HTTP requests. This is the simpler and more widely supported option, but it may have higher latency compared to gRPC due to the overhead of HTTP.

            gRPC, on the other hand, provides a more efficient and low-latency communication channel between the agent and server. It uses a binary format for data transmission, and supports bi-directional streaming and service discovery. The `--protocol` flag is set to `grpc` when using gRPC.

            By default, Consul Agent uses HTTP protocol. To use gRPC, you need to have Consul Server installed with the gRPC plugin enabled and configure the agent accordingly.
        raft-protocol: '[AI] The `--raft-protocol` flag in the Consul Agent command refers to the Raft consensus algorithm used by Consul for its distributed key-value store and service discovery data. This flag indicates that the Consul Agent will use the Raft protocol for achieving consensus among multiple agents in a Consul cluster, ensuring that all members have the same data and maintaining availability and reliability of services.'
        read-replica: '[AI] The `consul agent --read-replica` flag is used with Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool. This flag instructs the Consul agent to run in read-replica mode, meaning it will replicate data from a master Consul server for high availability and disaster recovery purposes. In this setup, there is one writer (master) and multiple readers (replicas). The agent still performs local service discovery and DNS, but does not accept writes. This configuration improves the overall resilience of the Consul cluster by distributing data across multiple nodes.'
        recursor: '[AI] The `flag "--recursor" for the Consul agent` instructs it to perform recursive discovery of services in the Consul service registry. When enabled, the agent will not only register its own services but also discover and register services that are running on other agents or nodes in the same Consul datacenter. This helps build a comprehensive view of all the available services within the Consul cluster.'
        rejoin: '[AI] `consul agent --rejoin` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, a distributed, highly available key-value and service discovery solution. This command is used to instruct the Consul agent to attempt rejoining a Consul cluster after being disconnected or manually stopped. When run, the agent will automatically detect any nearby Consul servers and try to connect to them, aiming to reestablish its position within the cluster. The --rejoin flag ensures that the agent does not start a new server but only tries to join an existing one.'
        retry-interval: '[AI] The `--retry-interval` flag in the Consul Agent command is used to configure the time interval between retries when an agent fails to communicate with the Consul server or when it encounters other errors during registration or check-in. By default, the retry interval is set to 5 seconds, but you can adjust this value by specifying a duration in seconds or a string representing a time interval (e.g., "1m30s" for one minute and thirty seconds). The flag helps ensure that the agent continues attempting to register with or check-in to the server even if it initially fails, which is essential for maintaining service discovery and health checking in distributed systems using Consul.'
        retry-interval-wan: '[AI] The `--retry-interval-wan` flag in Consul Agent relates to its automatic retry mechanism for connecting to a Consul server over wide area network (WAN). When set, it specifies the interval between retries when the agent is unable to connect to the Consul server due to network issues. This helps ensure that the agent continues attempting to contact the server despite intermittent WAN connectivity. The flag takes a duration value, for example "30s" or "1m".'
        retry-join: '[AI] The `consul agent --retry-join` flag is used when starting the Consul agent to configure it to automatically retry joining a Consul cluster if it initially fails to do so. This is useful in scenarios where the Consul server or network conditions are unstable, preventing the agent from initially joining the cluster. By enabling this flag, the agent will periodically attempt to rejoin the cluster until successful.'
        retry-join-wan: '[AI] The `consul agent --retry-join-wan` flag is used to configure Consul, a service discovery and configuration management tool, to automatically join a datacenter in a Wide Area Network (WAN) environment using an external address for discovery. This flag enables the Consul agent to periodically attempt joining the Consul cluster by contacting other Consul servers over the Internet, instead of relying on a local Discovery Service or manually specifying the addresses of the servers to join. This is useful when agents are geographically dispersed and cannot communicate directly with each other via a local network.'
        retry-max: '[AI] The `--retry-max` flag in the Consul Agent command refers to the maximum number of times an operation will be retried if it fails. This is particularly useful when working with dynamic and complex systems, where failures can occur due to various reasons like network instability or configuration changes. By specifying a retry limit, you can prevent the agent from continuously attempting an operation that may not be recoverable, while also allowing for some degree of resilience to transient errors. The default value is 5 times.'
        retry-max-wan: '[AI] The `consul agent --retry-max-wan` flag is a configuration option for the Consul agent, an open-source service discovery and configuration management tool. This flag sets the maximum number of times the agent will attempt to establish a connection over Wide Area Network (WAN) links before considering the connection failed. By default, the Consul agent retries connection attempts indefinitely. However, setting `--retry-max-wan` to a specific number limits the number of retries, which can be useful for managing network connectivity and improving system performance in certain environments.'
        segment: '[AI] The `--segment` flag is used with Consul Agent, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration management, and orchestration. It specifies that the agent should run in a segmented mode, where each data center or physical location is considered as a separate segment. This allows for logical grouping of services based on their geographical location or other criteria, improving communication efficiency and security within the Consul cluster.'
        serf-lan-allowed-cidrs: '[AI] `consul agent --serf-lan-allowed-cidrs` is a command-line option used with the Consul agent, an open-source service discovery and configuration management tool. This option configures the Serf library, which Consul uses for client-side Discovery, to allow incoming connections only from specified IP addresses or CIDR blocks. The argument `--serf-lan-allowed-cidrs` expects a list of allowed CIDRs separated by commas. For example, `--serf-lan-allowed-cidrs 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16` would allow connections from any IP address in the 10.0.0.0/8 and 192.168.0.0/16 subnets. This option increases security by limiting access to the Consul agent from trusted sources only.'
        serf-lan-bind: |-
            [AI] The `consul agent --serf-lan-bind` flag is used to configure the Consul agent, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration management, and orchestration, when it runs in a local area network (LAN) environment.

             Specifically, the flag sets the LAN-bound address for the Serf HTTP client, which Consul uses for external communication. It specifies the IP address and port number that Consul should use to listen for incoming connections from other agents or services in the same LAN. This is important for ensuring secure communication within a private network, as it allows Consul to communicate only with trusted entities.
        serf-lan-port: '[AI] The `--serf-lan-port` flag in the Consul Agent command (`consul agent`) is used to configure the port number for the Serf lan interface, which is a library used by Consul for making HTTP and HTTPS requests. This flag helps specify the local address and port number that other consul agents or services on the same network can use to communicate with this particular Consul Agent.'
        serf-wan-allowed-cidrs: '[AI] The `--serf-wan-allowed-cidrs` flag in the Consul Agent command relates to the Service Discovery and Connectivity tool called Serf, which is used by Consul for external discovery and communication between nodes. This option sets the IP address ranges (in CIDR format) that are allowed for WAN communications initiated by Serf. By default, all IP addresses are allowed; however, setting this flag restricts Serf to communicate only with the specified IP addresses or networks. It enhances security by limiting external connections originating from Consul agents.'
        serf-wan-bind: |-
            [AI] The `flag "consul agent --serf-wan-bind"` is a command-line option for the Consul agent. It is used to specify the network interface(s) on which the Serf library, Consul's HTTP and RPC client, will listen for incoming connections.

            Serf is Consul's built-in transport layer, and it is responsible for establishing and maintaining communication between agents and clients in a Consul cluster. By default, Serf listens on all available interfaces for incoming connections. However, you may want to restrict this by specifying particular interfaces using the `--serf-wan-bind` flag.

            For example, `consul agent --serf-wan-bind 192.168.0.5:8301` would bind Serf to listen on IP address `192.168.0.5` and port `8301`. This could be useful in environments where you want to restrict Consul traffic only to certain interfaces or subnets for security reasons.
        serf-wan-port: '[AI] The `flag "consul agent --serf-wan-port"` is used in Consul, a Connect and Service Mesh platform by Hashicorp, to configure the external listener port for Serf, Consul''s built-in HTTP client. Serf is responsible for discovering and checking the health of remote services that are registered with Consul. Setting this flag enables Consul to listen on a specified port for incoming Serf requests from WAN clients, allowing for communication between distributed services across wide area networks.'
        server: '[AI] The `flag "consul agent --server"` is used when starting the Consul agent in server mode. This means that the agent will not only join a Consul cluster as a member but also accept RPC and HTTP requests from other agents or clients, becoming part of the Consul service discovery and configuration management platform. In essence, this flag enables the agent to act as both a participant and a leader in the Consul cluster.'
        server-port: '[AI] The `--server-port` flag in the Consul Agent command (`consul agent`) sets the HTTP and RPC server port number that the Consul agent listens on for external communication. By default, both servers listen on port 8500, but you can specify a custom port by using this flag. For example, `consul agent --server-port=8401` will start the agent with its HTTP and RPC server listening on port 8401 instead of the default 8500.'
        syslog: '[AI] `consul agent --syslog` is a command-line argument used with the Consul agent, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. The `--syslog` flag enables the Consul agent to send its logs to a remote syslog server instead of writing them to local files. This can be useful in large environments where centralized log management is preferred. By forwarding logs to a syslog server, logging data can be consolidated and processed more efficiently, improving overall system monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities.'
        ui: '[AI] The `flag "consul agent --ui"` is used with the Consul agent, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This flag enables the User Interface (UI) mode when starting the Consul agent. In UI mode, a web interface becomes available on the specified address and port (default: 8500), allowing users to interactively monitor and manage the Consul service registry and connectivity status of registered services.'
        ui-content-path: '[AI] The `--ui-content-path` flag in the Consul Agent command is used to specify the custom path for the user interface (UI) content files served by the Consul HTTP API. By default, Consul looks for UI content in its installed directory. However, with this flag, you can point it to an alternative location where your custom UI content is stored. This allows you to modify the look and feel of the Consul web interface without affecting the functionality of the agent itself.'
        ui-dir: '[AI] `flag "ui-dir" in the Consul Agent command line option` `--ui-dir` sets the directory where Consul will install and serve its web UI (User Interface). This allows users to access the Consul service through a web dashboard, providing an interface for managing and monitoring the Consul infrastructure. The value provided should be an absolute filepath.'
