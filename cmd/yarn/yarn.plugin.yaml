    command: '[AI] The `yarn plugin` command is not a standalone Yarn command, but rather a way to use custom plugins within Yarn workflows by extending its functionality. To create a Yarn plugin, you need to write a Node.js module that follows the plugin API specification and install it in your project using `npm install <plugin-name>` or `yarn add <plugin-name>`. After installation, you can configure and use the plugin with other Yarn commands or workflows (such as `build`, `test`, etc.) by adding a `plugins:` key to your `package.json` file and specifying the installed plugin name there.'
