    command: '[AI] The `systemctl stop` command is used to stop a systemd service or target in Linux. Systemd is a popular init system and service manager for Linux operating systems. By stopping a service, all related processes are gracefully terminated, and the resources they were using are freed up. The specified service or target must be registered with systemd to use this command effectively. It takes the name of the service or target as an argument. For example: `systemctl stop myservice`.'
