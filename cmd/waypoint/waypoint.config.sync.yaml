    command: '[AI] The `waypoint config sync` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool to synchronize the configured values between the local and remote infrastructure. It merges any local changes with the latest version of the remote configuration, ensuring that both are consistent. This is particularly useful when working collaboratively or when making updates locally and then propagating them to the production environment.'

        app: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint config sync --app` command is a part of Google's Waypoint configuration management tool. It is used to synchronize the application-specific configurations stored in a Waypoint YAML manifest file with the actual running state of that application on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or any other supported platform.

            This command performs the following actions:

            1. Fetches the current configuration for all the apps defined in the YAML file.
            2. Compares the fetched configurations with the running configurations, and calculates the differences between them.
            3. Applies any necessary updates to bring the running configurations in line with those defined in the YAML file.
            4. Reconciles any resource inconsistencies.

            In summary, `waypoint config sync --app` is a useful command for ensuring that your application configurations are consistent between your desired state and the actual state, making it easier to manage and maintain your applications.
        plain: '[AI] The `waypoint config sync --plain` command is a part of Waypoint, an open-source tool for managing multi-cloud infrastructure as code. This specific command is used to synchronize configuration data between Waypoint''s local state and the remote infrastructure. The `--plain` flag is optional but instructs Waypoint to output the configuration data in plain text format, without applying any transformation or formatting rules. The result can be used for further processing, comparison, or manual review.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint config sync --project` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source infrastructure automation tool by Hashicorp. This command synchronizes the configuration of a specific project between the local and remote Waypoint backends, ensuring that any changes made to the project''s configuration files are applied to the target infrastructure. By using `--project` option, you can specify the name or path of the project to be synced, making it easier to manage multiple projects within the same Waypoint environment.'
        workspace: '[AI] `waypoint config sync --workspace` is a command used in Google Cloud''s Waypoint tool to synchronize configuration data between multiple environments, specifically within a given workspace in Waypoint. The command fetches the latest configuration from the source of truth (usually a Git repository) and applies it to the target environment or set of environments defined in the current workspace. This ensures that all configured resources are consistent with the latest desired state.'
