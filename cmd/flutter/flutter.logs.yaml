    command: '[AI] The `flutter logs` command is used to view the log output from a running Flutter application. When you run this command in your terminal or command prompt, it will display the most recent logs printed by the Dart VM or the Flutter engine. This can be helpful for debugging issues with your Flutter app, as it allows you to see the detailed information about the messages, warnings, and errors that are being generated during runtime.'
    flag:
        clear: '[AI] `flutter logs --clear` is a command used in Flutter development to clear previously written log messages in the console. It does not print any new logs but only clears the existing ones, providing a clean slate for observing and analyzing fresh logs from your application.'
        device-timeout: '[AI] `flutter logs --device-timeout` is a command used in Flutter development for logging output from a running Flutter application on a connected device or emulator. The `--device-timeout` option sets a timeout value for waiting for the device to provide log output before terminating the command. If the device does not respond within the specified time, the command will exit and display an error message. This can be helpful in cases where the application is stuck or not responding, allowing developers to quickly diagnose issues and take appropriate action.'
        help: '[AI] `flutter logs --help` is a command used in the Flutter framework for displaying information about the `logs` sub-command. It provides a brief description of what the command does, which is to print the output of logging channels in a Flutter project. Additionally, it lists the available options and their meanings, such as specifying a filter or a verbose level for the logs.'
