        [AI] The `xdotool` command is a versatile tool for automating interaction with X11 windows. The specific command `xdotool set_desktop <WINDOWID>` is used to change the focused desktop or virtual workspace of the X window manager to a specified desktop number.

        The `<WINDOWID>` argument refers to the unique identifier assigned to an open window, which can be obtained using other xdotool commands like `search --name --class`. The command sets the focus on that window and then changes the focused desktop as specified.

        relative: '[AI] `xdotool` is a system tool for interacting with X11 applications using a simple and flexible API. The command `xdotool set_desktop --relative <number>` is used to move the focus to the desktop with the given relative number from the current desktop. A positive number moves forward, while a negative number moves backward. For example, `xdotool set_desktop --relative 1` would focus the next desktop, and `xdotool set_desktop --relative -1` would focus the previous desktop.'
