documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "waypoint hostname register" command is used in Cisco IOS XR and NX-OS networking operating systems for configuring a device as a hostname member of a WAIL (Wide Area Automatic peering Layer 3) or Flexible Peer Group. This command registers the local device with the specified WAIL or peer group using its hostname as an identifier. It helps in automating and managing peer relationships between devices in a network, particularly in large-scale and complex networks.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The command `flag "waypoint hostname register --app"` is used with the Waypoint configuration management tool to register a new application hostname in Waypoint''s internal registry. This flag is typically used as part of a Waypoint configuration file or pipeline script, and it specifies that the associated application should be assigned a unique, automatically managed hostname based on its name or label. The `--app` flag indicates that this registration applies to an application rather than another type of resource.'
        plain: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint hostname register --plain` command is a part of Hashicorp's Waypoint configuration management tool. This specific command is used to register a new hostname with the Waypoint server in plaintext format.

            When you run this command, it sends the hostname information (without any encryption or obfuscation) to the Waypoint server for registration. It does not generate any configuration files, certificates, or other artifacts, making it suitable for manual usage or scripting.

            This plaintext registration can be beneficial in environments where you want a simple and quick way to register hosts without going through the full certificate generation process. However, keep in mind that sending plaintext data over an unsecured connection may pose security risks, so it should only be used when necessary and with appropriate precautions.
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint hostname register` command is used with Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool. This command registers a new hostname in Waypoint''s internal DNS server, associating it with the given project. The `--project` flag specifies the name of the project to which the registered hostname will belong.'
        workspace: '[AI] The command `flag "waypoint hostname register --workspace"` is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool to register a new hostname for a specific workspace. This command adds or updates the DNS record associated with the given hostname for the specified Waypoint workspace. It allows easy discovery and connection to remote resources managed by Waypoint.'
