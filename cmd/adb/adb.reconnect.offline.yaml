description: reset offline/unauthorized devices to force reconnect
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `adb reconnect offline` command is used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to establish a connection with an Android device that is not currently connected or reachable through the usual methods, such as USB or Wi-Fi direct. Instead, it allows you to specify the IP address and port number of the device manually. By using this command with the "offline" argument, you''re telling ADB to try connecting in offline mode, which can be helpful when dealing with specific network configurations or devices that are not reachable through standard methods. Remember that providing incorrect IP address or port information may result in connection errors.'
