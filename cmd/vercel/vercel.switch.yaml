        [AI] The `vercel switch` command is a part of Vercel CLI (Command Line Interface) used to switch between different projects or applications in your Vercel account. It allows you to easily manage multiple projects without having to log out and log back in with different access tokens.

        The basic syntax is:

        ```bash
        vercel switch <project-name>
        ```

        Replace `<project-name>` with the name of your Vercel project. This command will make that project the active one, meaning it will be the default project when you use other Vercel commands like deploying or previewing changes.
