documentation:
    command: '[AI] `go doc` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used to generate and display documentation for packages and their types, functions, constants, etc., from installed Go packages. It reads the annotations (commonly written using the `//doc` syntax) present in the source code files and generates Markdown or HTML formatted output. This command facilitates easy access to up-to-date documentation without having to build or install the package first.'
    flag:
        C: '[AI] The `go-tool-doc` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used to generate and update Godoc documentation for packages and their related files. The option `-C`, or `--cmd` flag, is used to specify the command line interface (CLI) definition file for the package being documented. This file contains information about the commands provided by the package and their usage. By providing this flag with the correct path to the CLI definition file, the `go-tool-doc` command can accurately document and generate the CLI help text for that specific Go package.'
        all: '[AI] `go-tool-doc -all` is a command used with the Go programming language''s `godoc` tool. This command generates and updates the documentation for all packages in a Go project that has been marked with `//doc` comments, or is linked from another documented package. The generated documentation is saved as HTML files within the `dist/docs` directory of the project. This command provides a convenient way to keep project documentation up-to-date, and allows easy access to the documentation through a web browser.'
        c: '[AI] `go-tool-doc` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language ecosystem. The `-c` (short for "generate Channels") flag is used to generate API documentation for channels in Go packages. This flag generates the Markdown files for each channel under the `doc/api` directory in the given package.'
        cmd: '[AI] `go-tool-doc -cmd` is a command used with the Go tool, `gov build`, to generate and update Godoc documentation for Go packages. The `-cmd` flag specifically instructs `go-tool-doc` to process files in the `cmd` directory of the current Go module, which typically contains entry points for executable programs. By generating and keeping up-to-date documentation, developers can easily understand how to use these commands and packages.'
        short: '[AI] `go-tool-doc` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language ecosystem. The `-short` flag is an option used with this tool to generate a brief summary of the documentation for one or more Go packages. It produces output in a compact format, which can be easily parsed by scripts and other automated tools. For each package, it displays the name, exported functions, and a short description.'
        src: '[AI] `go-tool-doc -src` is a command used with the Go programming language''s `goDoc` tool. This command generates and displays the Godoc documentation for the source files specified in its argument list. The flag `-src` tells the tool to include the source code while generating the documentation, resulting in a more comprehensive output that includes both documentation text and the corresponding code snippets.'
        u: '[AI] `go-tool-doc -u` is a command used in Go programming language development environment. It updates the Godoc documentation for packages and their related API references, synced with the latest package code. This command is particularly useful when developing or maintaining projects where accurate and up-to-date documentation is essential.'
