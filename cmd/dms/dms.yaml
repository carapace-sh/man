    command: |-
        [AI] "DMS" is not a standalone command in any commonly used programming language or operating system. It could refer to various things depending on the context, such as:

        1. Database Management Systems like Amazon DMS (Database Migration Service) for moving data between databases, or MySQL Workbench's Data Modeling tool.
        2. In Adobe Creative Cloud, "DMS" stands for "Document Management Services".
        3. In the context of satellite imagery and geospatial data, "DMS" could refer to Digital Mosaic Systems or Digital Mapping Systems.

        Without more specific context, it's impossible to provide a definitive explanation of what "dms" means.
    flag:
        allowedIps: '[AI] `dms-allowed-ips` is a configuration setting in Amazon Data Streams (DMS) for specifying a list of IP addresses or CIDR blocks that are allowed to connect and access the DMS endpoint. It enhances security by restricting access only to trusted sources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.'
        config: '[AI] The `dms` command with the `-config` option is used in Amazon DMS (Database Migration Service) to provide a configuration file for the migration task. This flag allows you to specify the location of an JSON or YAML formatted file that contains all the necessary settings and parameters for your migration task, such as source database endpoint, schema, username, password, and other relevant information. This makes it easier to manage complex migrations by storing all the configuration details in a single file rather than passing them as command-line arguments.'
        deviceIcon: |-
            [AI] The `dms -deviceIcon` flag is used in AppleScript to set or get the icon of a connected device, such as an iPhone or iPad, in the Finder or Desktop Manager (Finder background process). It returns a reference to the device's icon image file, typically in .icns format. When used with `set`, it allows you to assign a new icon to the connected device. For example:

            ```applescript
            tell application "System Events" to set theDevice to first device of (class "Mobility Device")
            if (exists (theDevice's property "name")) then
                tell application "Finder" to set theIconFile to POSIX file "/Users/username/Desktop/newicon.icns"
                tell application "System Events" to set theDevice's device property -deviceIcon to theIconFile
            end if
            ```
        fFprobeCachePath: |-
            [AI] The `dms` flag in this command refers to Amazon DMS (Database Migration Service), which is a service provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services) for migrating and replicating data between databases.

            The `-fF` option specifies the use of Fast Freeze and Fast Apply modes in DMS, which are optimized for minimizing downtime during database migrations or replication.

            The `probeCachePath` argument is a configuration parameter indicating the path to an FFPROBE cache directory. This directory is used by Amazon DMS to store metadata about the source database's schema and data types when performing schema discovery or metadata mapping during the migration process. By using a cached probe, subsequent migrations can be faster since the metadata is already available, reducing the overall migration time.
        forceTranscodeTo: '[AI] The `dms -forceTranscodeTo` flag is a command-line option for Amazon DMS (Database Migration Service). It''s used to forcefully convert or transcode the data types of columns during migration, even if there are no type discrepancies between the source and target databases. This can be helpful when dealing with specific edge cases where column data types need to be changed explicitly, despite no actual type mismatch.'
        friendlyName: '[AI] The `dms -friendlyName` flag is a configuration option used in Amazon DataBrew, a visual data preparation service provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services). This flag is set to specify a user-friendly name for a database or data source connection profile in DataBrew. The friendly name helps identify the connection profile easily when creating or selecting data flows. It does not affect the underlying database or data source configuration.'
        http: |-
            [AI] The `dms` flag in a Unix or Linux command line context does not directly correspond to an `-http` option. Instead, `dms` is short for Data Movement System, which is a part of Amazon Web Services (AWS) used for moving data between different AWS services or storage locations. It's typically used with tools like `aws dms`, `glue`, and `lambda`.

            The `-http` option, however, is commonly found in various command line applications like `curl`, `wget`, and `httpie`. It is used to configure HTTP requests for accessing remote web resources. When working with AWS DMS, you may use these tools to interact with DMS APIs, but the `dms` flag itself does not relate to `-http`.
        ifname: '[AI] The `dms -ifname` flag is used with the Amazon S3 Data Transfer Service (DMS) in AWS (Amazon Web Services). It specifies the input file name or network interface name for a replication task. When used with a file-based source, the flag indicates the name of the file to be transferred. When used with a network interface as a source, it identifies the interface to be replicated from. This flag helps ensure that the correct data is being replicated during the DMS task execution.'
        ignoreHidden: '[AI] `dms --ignore-hidden` is a command-line argument or option for Data Migration Service (DMS) replication tasks in Amazon Web Services (AWS). This option tells DMS to ignore hidden files and directories during the migration process. Hidden files are typically identified by a file name that starts with a dot (e.g., `.file`). By using this flag, you can exclude such files from being replicated between your source and target endpoints, potentially speeding up the migration process or preventing unintended data transfer.'
        ignoreUnreadable: '[AI] The `dms` flag `--ignoreUnreadable` is used in data migration tasks to instruct the tool to ignore errors caused by reading unreachable or unreadable files or databases during the migration process. This means that if a file or database cannot be accessed due to various reasons like network issues, permissions, or file system errors, the migration process will continue without failing. However, it''s important to note that ignoring such errors might result in data loss or inconsistencies, so this flag should be used with caution and only when you are aware of the potential risks and have a solid plan for handling any missing or corrupt data.'
        logHeaders: '[AI] `dms` is a data migration service provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services). The `--log-headers` option is used when invoking the `dms` Replication Task or Subtask execution API. This option causes AWS DMS to include additional metadata in the CloudWatch logs, such as the start time of the task, the source and target endpoint identifiers, and the Replication Instance ARN. The log headers provide valuable information for debugging and monitoring data migration tasks.'
        noProbe: '[AI] The `dms` command in SQL Server Data Migration Assistant (DMA) is used for transferring data between different sources and destinations. The option `-noProbe` is a switch that disables the automatic detection of data types during the assessment phase of the migration process. This means that the source and target metadata will not be compared, and any type discrepancies will not be reported. Instead, the migration will proceed with the assumption that all data types are compatible. Using this option can speed up the assessment process, but it may also increase the risk of data type conversion errors during the data migration itself.'
        noTranscode: '[AI] `dms --noTranscode` is a command-line option for Amazon DMS (Database Migration Service). It disables the automatic transformation of data types during replication. This means that data will be copied from source to target database with the same data types and formats as in the source. It can be useful when the target database schema is identical to the source, or when specific data type mappings are required. The `--noTranscode` flag helps ensure consistency between the databases and minimize potential data loss or format issues during migration.'
        notifyInterval: '[AI] The `-notifyInterval` flag in the MySQL database tool `mysqld_safe` or `mysql.serv` configuration file (used with the `--defaults-file` option) sets the interval for notifying the MySQL error log and syslog of important events, such as server startups, crashes, and errors. The value is specified in seconds. For example, `-notifyInterval=3600` sets the interval to one hour (3600 seconds).'
        path: '[AI] The `dms` command with the `-path` option is used in data migration tasks within Amazon Web Services (AWS). This option specifies the source and target paths for data migration activities using AWS Database Migration Service (DMS). It takes a comma-separated list of source and target endpoints or instances, followed by the corresponding replication instance''s read/write endpoint or instance identifier. For example: `dms replication-instance-arn --source-endpoint src_endpoint_arn, --target-endpoint tar_endpoint_arn --path src_db_instance:database_name, tar_db_instance:new_database_name`. This command migrates the data from the specified database within the source DB instance to the corresponding database in the target DB instance.'
        stallEventSubscribe: '[AI] `dms --stall-event-subscribe` is a command in Amazon DMS (Database Migration Service), which is used to start an event subscriptions for a replication instance that is in the STALL state. When a replication task encounters errors, it can enter the STALL state. Event subscriptions allow DMS to capture and process data changes from the source database, helping to maintain data consistency between the source and target databases. By using `dms --stall-event-subscribe`, you are specifically enabling event subscriptions while the replication task is in the STALL state to automatically recover and resume the replication process.'
