description: Obfuscate a configuration value using a key
flags:
    -k, --key=: the key to use when obfuscating the clear-text value
    -v, --value=: the value, in clear text, to be obfuscated
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `newrelic agent config obfuscate` command is used to obfuscate or hide sensitive configuration data in New Relic Agent''s configuration file, primarily for security reasons. This command rewrites certain keys and values in the configuration file with randomized strings or placeholders, making it difficult for unauthorized users to understand the original values. This way, the actual configuration information remains hidden while still allowing the agent to function properly.'
    flag:
        key: '[AI] The `newrelic agent config obfuscate --key` command is used to obfuscate or mask sensitive configuration data in New Relic agent configurations, specifically the API key. This is done to enhance the security of your application by making it more difficult for unauthorized users to discover and use your New Relic API key. When you run this command with your key as an argument, it will encrypt and replace the original API key with an obfuscated version in your configuration file. This way, even if someone gains access to your configuration file, they won''t be able to directly use your API key without going through the process of decoding the obfuscated data.'
        value: '[AI] The `newrelic agent config obfuscate --value` command is a feature of the New Relic Agent, which is used to obscure (or hide) specific configuration values in the New Relic instrumentation data sent from an application. This can help protect sensitive information such as API keys or database credentials from being exposed. The `--value` option specifies the value that should be obfuscated within the given configuration key. For instance, `newrelic agent config obfuscate --key appName --value "myApp"` would obscure the string "myApp" whenever the configuration key "appName" is reported to New Relic.'
