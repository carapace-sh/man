documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pamac-clean` is a command used in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. It cleans up metadata and cached packages that are no longer needed, freeing up disk space. By running `pamac-clean`, you ensure that your system only retains the necessary data for current installed packages. This can help to maintain an efficient and clutter-free package repository.'
    flag:
        build-files: '[AI] `pamac` is a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. The command `pamac clean --build-files` instructs it to remove cached build files from the local repository. Build files are temporary data generated during the compilation of source packages. Cleaning them up helps free disk space and improves performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be downloaded in case of reinstalling or rebuilding packages.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `pamac` is a package manager for Arch Linux and its variants. The command `pamac clean --dry-run` is used to simulate a cleaning operation without actually making any changes. The `clean` action removes unnecessary files such as downloaded package files, cached dependency files, and other metadata. The `--dry-run` option performs a rehearsal of the command, showing which files would be removed or changed if the command were run without this flag. In summary, `pamac clean --dry-run` is a safety measure to preview the effects before executing a package cleaning action.'
        keep: '[AI] `pacman` is a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. The command `pacman clean --keep` is used to remove unused files, specifically cached packages and their downloaded files, from the local system without deleting the package database or the list of installed packages. The `--keep` option ensures that the local package database and the list of installed packages are not deleted during the cleaning process.'
        no-confirm: '[AI] `pamac` is a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. The command `pamac clean --no-confirm` is used to remove unused files, such as downloaded packages and cache, from the local system to free up disk space. The option `--no-confirm` skips the confirmation prompt before executing the command.'
        uninstalled: '[AI] `pamac` is a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. The command `pamac clean --uninstalled` instructs it to remove metadata for packages that are currently not installed on the system. This helps keep local data in sync with the central repositories, reducing disk space usage and potential version conflicts.'
        verbose: '[AI] `pamac` is a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. The command `pamac clean --verbose` instructs it to perform a cleanup operation with detailed output. This means that the package manager will delete unused files, such as downloaded packages, cache files, and other temporary data, while providing a verbose output, displaying information about each file being removed for transparency and better understanding of the process.'
