    command: |-
        [AI] `glab repo transfer` is a GitLab CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to transfer the ownership of a GitLab project repository from one user or group to another. It requires appropriate permissions, and the source and destination GitLab projects must exist. The basic syntax is:

        ```bash
        glab transfer project <source-project> <destination-project> [@<username>|<group>]
        ```

        Replace `<source-project>`, `<destination-project>`, and `[@<username>|<group>]` with the respective GitLab project names and the desired username or group to transfer ownership to. This command does not clone, pull, or push any code; it only changes the repository's ownership setting within GitLab.
    flag:
        target-namespace: '[AI] `glab repo transfer --target-namespace` is a command in GitLab''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, Glab. It is used for transferring repository projects from one namespace to another within the same GitLab instance. The command moves the project''s content, including its history and branches, to the specified target namespace while maintaining existing web hooks and access controls. This command simplifies the process of moving repositories between groups or projects within an organization without manually copying files and configuring new settings.'
        "yes": '[AI] `glab repo transfer --yes` is a GitLab CLI command used to transfer a repository from one GitLab instance to another. The `--yes` option is used to confirm and proceed with the operation without any further prompts for confirmation. It assumes that you have already authenticated and authorized the source and destination repositories for the transfer.'
