documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint context list` command is used in Terraform''s Waypoint tool to display a list of available working directories, also known as contexts. Contexts allow you to manage multiple Terraform workspaces or projects from a single terminal session. By running this command, you can view the names and paths of your existing contexts, helping you switch between them easily.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `waypoint context list --app` command in Docker is used to list all available application contexts or environments for a specific Docker application (defined using a `docker-compose.yml` file). These contexts represent different combinations of build, create, and start options for the application. By specifying the `--app` flag, Waypoint ensures that only contexts related to the specified application are displayed.'
        plain: '[AI] The `waypoint context list --plain` command is used in Docker Compose to display a list of all defined waypoints and their respective names and project keys, in plain text format. Waypoints allow for multiple contexts or environments in a single file, making it easier to manage different configurations.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint context list --project` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source application delivery platform by Docker, to list the available projects within a Waypoint account or organization. This command helps users manage and keep track of multiple projects they have access to, allowing them to easily switch between them using Waypoint CLI.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint context list --workspace` command is used in the Waypoint tool, which is a multi-cloud application delivery platform. This command lists all the workspaces available in Waypoint. Workspaces represent isolated environments for developing, testing, and deploying applications with Waypoint. Each workspace can have its own configuration, allowing you to manage multiple environments easily.'
