documentation:
    command: '[AI] `nix why-depends` is a command from Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This command is used to show the dependencies of a specific Nix package or expression, including both direct and transitive dependencies. By providing the name or path of a package as an argument, `why-depends` displays the dependency tree that satisfies the given package''s installation requirements. It helps in understanding the relationships between packages in the Nix ecosystem and can be useful for debugging dependency issues.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `nix-why-depends` is a Nix expression that shows the reasons why a given package or expression depends on another package in the Nix Package Manager. The `--all` flag expands this output to include indirect dependencies, i.e., packages that are not directly required by the given expression but are still necessary for its build and execution. In summary, using `nix-why-depends --all` will show you all direct and transitive dependencies of a Nix package or expression.'
        arg: '[AI] `nix why-depends` is a command from Nix Package Manager used to show the dependencies of a specific package and why they are required. The `--arg` option is used to provide an argument, which can be the name or path of a package or a build output. For example, running `nix why-depends --arg myPackage` will display the dependencies of `myPackage` and the reasons why they are needed.'
        argstr: |-
            [AI] The `nix-why` command is a tool in the Nix packaging system used to explain why a given expression or package depends on another. The option `--argstr` is used to provide an argument string to be passed to a specific command or function being queried. For example, if you want to understand why a certain package `myPackage` depends on another package `dependency`, you can use the following command:

            ```sh
            nix-why --argstr "myPackage" why dependentPackages
            ```

            The `--argstr` option is used here to pass the string "myPackage" as an argument to the `dependentPackages` function in `nix-why`. This will help `nix-why` determine the dependencies of the given package (`myPackage`) and explain why those dependencies are needed.
        commit-lock-file: |-
            [AI] The `nix why-depends` command is a part of Nix Pakages, a configuration management system. It's used to show the dependencies of a given package or configuration in the Nix expression language.

            The option `--commit-lock-file` generates a Nix lock file, which records the exact versions and checksums of all packages required to build or run your project. This is useful for reproducibility and ensuring that all team members are using the same dependencies. The flag `--commit-lock-file` tells `nix why-depends` to create or update this file upon execution.
        debug: '[AI] The `nix-why-depends` is a command from Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It''s used to explain why a specific package depends on another package in the Nix expression language. The `--debug` flag is an optional argument that provides more detailed output, which includes the exact dependency path and expression used in the dependency relation. This can be helpful for debugging and understanding complex dependency relationships within the Nix ecosystem.'
        debugger: '[AI] `nix-why` is a Nix package analysis tool that helps identify dependencies of a given Nix expression or package. The `--debugger` flag is an option used when invoking `nix why` with debugging capabilities enabled. It starts the tool in a debugging mode, which provides more detailed information about the dependency resolution process. This can be useful for debugging complex dependency issues or understanding why certain packages are being pulled in during the build process.'
        eval-store: '[AI] `nix why-depends` is a command from Nix Pakages Manager used to find and show the dependencies of a given Nix expression or package. The `--eval-store` option instructs it to evaluate any dependencies with unresolved variables in an interactive Nix expression evaluation session, and print out the final dependencies as output. This allows for more complex dependency resolution scenarios, especially when dealing with custom packages or complex build systems.'
        impure: '[AI] The `nix why-depends` command is a utility in Nix package manager to show the dependencies of a given package, including its implicit or impure dependencies. Impure dependencies are packages that are not directly required for building or running the main package but may be used during the build process and could affect the output of the build if changed. The `--impure` flag specifically requests displaying these impure dependencies in addition to the regular dependencies.'
        include: '[AI] `nix-why` is a Nix package tool that helps analyze the build and runtime dependencies of a given Nix expression or package. The `--include` option expands the analysis to include not only direct dependencies but also transitive ones, meaning all dependencies, directly or indirectly required by the specified expression or package. The `why-depends` command then lists these dependencies with their respective justifications (reasons for why they are needed).'
        inputs-from: '[AI] The `nix why-depends` command is a part of Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This command is used to show the dependencies of a given Nix expression or package, along with their justifications. The `--inputs-from` option filters the output to only show inputs (dependencies) that come from specific sources or packages. In simpler terms, it explains why a certain dependency is needed and where it comes from in the Nix expression tree.'
        log-format: |-
            [AI] The `nix why-depends` command is a tool from the Nix Package Manager used to investigate the dependencies of a given Nix expression. The `--log-format` option specifies the format of the output log.

            By default, the output is displayed in a human-readable format, but with this option, you can customize the output to be parsed by other scripts or tools. Some common formats include JSON, CSV, and TSV. The specifics of each format depend on the desired parsing tool or script. For example, JSON format provides key-value pairs for each dependency, making it easy for scripts written in languages like JavaScript to process.

            So, using the `nix why-depends --log-format=json expression` command will return the dependencies of the given expression in a JSON format that can be easily parsed and used by other tools or scripts.
        no-registries: '[AI] `nix why-depends` is a command from Nix Package Manager, which is used to show the dependencies of a given package along with their justifications. The `--no-registries` flag disables the search in remote registries for dependencies. In other words, it only considers the local packages and their dependencies, ignoring any external sources.'
        no-update-lock-file: '[AI] `nix-why-depends` is a command-line utility from Nix package manager used to explain the dependencies of a given Nix expression or package. The option `--no-update-lock-file` is used to prevent Nix from updating the lock file during the dependency resolution process. This means that the current state of dependencies in the lock file will not be modified, and instead, the command will show you the dependencies based on the latest definition of the packages and their build inputs, without changing the existing lock file.'
        no-write-lock-file: '[AI] `nix why-depends` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. The `--no-write-lock-file` option instructs the command not to create or use a write lock file during its execution. A write lock file ensures that only one instance of a command can run at a time to prevent conflicts. By disabling this feature, multiple instances of `why-depends` can run concurrently if desired.'
        override-flake: '[AI] The `nix why-depends` command with the `--override-flake` option is used in Nix Pakages Manager to show the dependencies of a given package, even if those dependencies are overridden by manual modifications or custom configurations in the Nix expression language. By default, `nix why-depends` only shows the direct dependencies, but with `--override-flake`, it also considers overridden dependencies. This allows for better understanding of the complete dependency graph of a package.'
        override-input: '[AI] The `nix-why` command is a part of Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `--depends` option shows the direct dependencies of a given Nix expression or package. The `--override-input` option allows specifying an alternative input path or value when resolving dependency conflicts. So, running `nix why --depends --override-input <expression/package>` will show the dependencies of the specified expression or package, taking into account any overridden inputs.'
        precise: '[AI] The `nix-why` command is a tool in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. It helps to explain why a specific package or dependency is installed in a Nix environment. The option `--precise` is used to request exact versions of dependencies that are required by the target package. When you run `nix why-depends --precise <package>`, it will output the list of dependencies with their precise versions that satisfy the requirement for the given package.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] The `nix why-depends` command is a utility from the Nix Package Manager, used to determine the build and runtime dependencies of a specific package or expression in the Nix expressions language. The `--print-build-logs` flag instructs it to also print the build logs for each dependency, which can be helpful for troubleshooting build issues and understanding the exact build steps taken for each dependency.'
        quiet: '[AI] `nix why-depends` is a command from the Nix Package Manager used to show the dependencies of a specific package. The `--quiet` option is used to suppress the output of extra messages and only display the dependent packages in a list format. So, running `nix why-depends --quiet <package-name>` will print out just the names of the packages that are depended upon by the given package.'
        recreate-lock-file: '[AI] `nix why-depends` is a command from the Nix Package Manager, which is used to show the dependencies of a given Nix expression or package. The `--recreate-lock-file` option instructs the command to create or update an existing Nix store lock file. A lock file is used to ensure that specific versions of packages are installed consistently across multiple builds or invocations of the same command. When the flag is used, the command will generate a new lock file reflecting the current dependencies and their versions.'
        update-input: '[AI] `nix-why-depends` is a command in Nix Package Manager used to analyze the build and runtime dependencies of a Nix expression. The `--update-input` option updates the input file for which dependencies are being queried before showing the results. This helps ensure that the latest dependencies are taken into account when analyzing the dependency tree.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `nix-why` is a command-line tool in Nix Package Manager used to explain the dependencies of a given package. The `--verbose` option increases the amount and detail of output produced by the command. The `why-depends` subcommand queries why a particular package depends on another package. In summary, `nix why-depends --verbose <package>` will show detailed information about why a specified package depends on other packages.'
