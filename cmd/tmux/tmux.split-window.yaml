documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux split-window` command in TMUX terminal multiplexer splits the current pane horizontally or vertically into two equal parts. By default, it opens a new shell in the second pane. You can use this command with prefix keys (usually `Ctrl+b`) followed by the desired direction key: `h` for horizontal and `v` for vertical split. This helps manage multiple processes within a single terminal session effectively.'
    flag:
        F: '[AI] The `tmux` command `split-window -F` creates a new horizontal or vertical pane within an existing `tmux` window, and sets the pane''s title or status bar using the provided `-F` (format) option. For example, `split-window -h -F "#h: %{pane_current_path}"` would create a new horizontal split with a title showing the current path of the pane.'
        I: '[AI] `tmux split-window` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that splits the current pane or window horizontally or vertically into two sub-panes. The `-I` flag that follows this command means "new-instance" or "new-session". It creates a new split-window inside a new instance or session instead of splitting an existing one. Thus, `tmux split-window -I` creates a new pane or window in a new Tmux session with the given terminal size.'
        P: '[AI] `tmux split-window -P` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to create a new pane or split a current pane horizontally (by default), with an equal height for both panes. The `-P` flag stands for "even-sized" or "equal-sized", ensuring that the newly created panes have the same size.'
        Z: '[AI] `tmux split-window -Z` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that splits the current pane horizontally and makes the new pane equal in size to the original one (the `-Z` flag ensures that both panes have an equal height). This allows users to run multiple commands or view multiple processes in separate panes within a single Tmux session.'
        b: '[AI] `tmux split-window` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that splits the current pane horizontally or vertically into two parts. The `-b` flag stands for "bottom" or "below," indicating that the new pane should be created below the existing one, thereby creating a vertical split. This command modifies the current window layout in Tmux by adding a new pane beneath the active one.'
        c: '[AI] The `tmux` command `split-window -c` creates a new vertical pane (split) in the current `tmux` terminal window or session. The `-c` option specifies that the new pane should be created to the right of the current pane. This can be useful for working with multiple processes or applications side by side within the same terminal window.'
        d: '[AI] The `tmux` command `split-window -d` is used to horizontally split an existing pane in a Tmux terminal session into two equal parts and delete the previously active pane. This creates a new, empty pane on one side of the newly created split. The `-d` option forces the deletion of the previous pane without prompting for confirmation.'
        e: '[AI] `tmux split-window -e` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to create a new pane or split an existing pane both horizontally and vertically. The `-e` flag specifies the command to be run in the new pane. When executed, it creates a new pane with the specified command already running inside it. This can be useful for opening multiple instances of the same program or having multiple processes running simultaneously within the same Tmux session.'
        h: '[AI] `tmux split-window -h` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to create a new horizontal split window. This means that the current pane will be split into two equal parts vertically, with the new pane appearing to the right or left of the existing one, depending on the direction specified by the ''-h'' flag (which stands for "horizontal"). The new window can then run a separate command or session, allowing for efficient multitasking within a single terminal screen.'
        l: '[AI] The `tmux` command `split-window -l` creates a new horizontal window pane of equal size at the bottom of the current pane in the terminal multiplexer session. The `-l` flag stands for "large," indicating that the new pane should cover as much height as possible, occupying the maximum available space below the current pane.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux` command `split-window -t` creates a new vertically or horizontally split pane within the current `tmux` terminal session. The `-t` option specifies the target pane for the split, which can be identified by its window title, number, or name. By default, it splits the current pane. This command is commonly used to view multiple processes or applications side by side within a single terminal session.'
        v: '[AI] The `tmux split-window` command with the `-v` option is used to vertically split the current pane or window in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. This creates a new pane or window below the current one, allowing you to run multiple commands or view multiple processes simultaneously within the same terminal session.'
