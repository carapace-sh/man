documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh project create` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new GitHub project directly from the terminal or command prompt. It allows users to specify various options such as project name, description, and public or private visibility. After running this command, GitHub creates a new repository with the specified settings and returns details about the newly created project including its URL.'
    flag:
        format: '[AI] `gh project create --format` is a command used in GitHub''s `gh` CLI tool to create a new project with a specific GitHub Project Board template format. The `--format` option specifies which template to use for the project''s board, such as "basic", "Scrum", or "Kanban". This command sets up a new repository and initializes a GitHub Project Board for issue tracking and project management alongside it.'
        jq: '[AI] `gh project create` is a command used in the GitHub CLI (gh) to create a new GitHub Project. The `--jq` flag is an option for specifying that the output of the command should be processed using JSON query language (JQ). In other words, instead of printing out the raw output of the `create` operation, the output will first be formatted as JSON and then processed by JQ to extract or modify specific information. This can be useful for automating tasks or analyzing data from the GitHub API.'
        owner: '[AI] `gh project create` is a GitHub CLI command used to create a new project in GitHub. The `--owner` option sets the account or organization that will own the new project. For instance, `gh project create myproject --owner=myusername` would create a new project named "myproject" under your GitHub username "myusername". This command requires authentication with GitHub and may require additional permissions depending on the specific use case.'
        template: '[AI] `gh project create --template` is a GitHub CLI command used to create a new GitHub Project with a predefined template. The `--template` option specifies which template to use, providing a starting point for the project''s structure and configuration files. This can save time and effort when setting up projects consistently across teams or for specific use cases.'
        title: '[AI] `gh project create --title` is a command used in the GitHub CLI (Git Hub Command Line Interface) to create a new project with the specified title. This command initializes a new directory with a .gitignore file, a README.md file, and a .github/workflows directory for continuous integration and deployment settings. The new project will be connected to your GitHub account.'
