documentation:
    command: '[AI] `bun run` is a command used in BUN (Bundler for Node.js Unmet Dependencies) to execute a Node.js project with automatically installed missing dependencies. When you run `bun install` to prepare your project, it saves the lockfile. Then, using `bun run` executes your project along with any specified scripts in your `package.json`. It''s an all-in-one solution for managing and running Node.js projects without having to deal with external package managers like npm or yarn.'
