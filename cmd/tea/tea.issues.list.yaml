documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea issues list` command is used in the GitLab application to view a list of issues associated with a given project. It retrieves information such as issue titles, descriptions, assignee, labels, and status, allowing users to quickly review and manage open issues within their project.'
    flag:
        assignee: '[AI] The `--assignee` option for the `tea issues list` command in GitLab is used to filter the output of the command to display only the issues that have been assigned to a specific user. This can be helpful for team members who want to focus on their own assignments or for managers who need to oversee the workload of their team members. When run without `--assignee`, the `tea issues list` command displays all open issues in a GitLab project by default.'
        author: '[AI] The `--author` option with the `tea issues list` command in Git is used to filter the output of the list command to only display issues raised by a specific author. For example, `tea issues list --author="John Doe"` will display a list of all issues in the repository created by "John Doe". This can be helpful for reviewing work done by a particular team member or contributor.'
        fields: '[AI] The `--fields` option used with the Tea CLI''s `issues list` command is utilized to specify which fields should be displayed when listing issues in a Git repository managed by Tea. This helps users customize the output and focus on the required data. By default, Tea lists the issue numbers, titles, and states. However, using this option, you can request additional fields like assignee, labels, or creation/updated dates to be included in the output. For instance, `tea issues list --fields number,title,assignee` will display the issue number, title, and assignee for each listed issue.'
        from: '[AI] The `--from` option in the `tea issues list` command is used to specify a starting point for listing issues in the TeaDB database. It takes a commit hash or a branch name as an argument, and returns issues that were opened or changed since that point. This can be useful when working with large projects or when you want to track changes to specific issues.'
        keyword: '[AI] The `tea issues list --keyword` command is used in the TeaDB database management system to retrieve a list of open issues or tickets related to a specific keyword or search term. This command helps users to filter and find issues efficiently, enabling them to focus on resolving or addressing the relevant ones.'
        kind: '[AI] The `--kind` option when using the `tea issues list` command in TeaDB, a database management tool for Teams data, is used to filter the output based on issue types. For instance, `tea issues list --kind bug` will return only issues marked as bugs. This flag helps users focus on specific types of issues and prioritize them accordingly.'
        labels: '[AI] The `tea issues list --labels` command is used in GitHub''s Terminal or Command Line Interface to filter and list all issues with specific labels on a given repository. The flags `--issues` specifies that you want to work with issues, while `--list` requests the output to be displayed as a simple list, and `--labels` filters the issues based on their assigned labels.'
        limit: '[AI] The `tea issues list --limit` command is used in the TeaDB database management system to retrieve a specified number of issues or problems from the list. The `--limit` option sets the maximum number of issues to be displayed. For example, `tea issues list --limit 5` would return the most recent 5 issues on the list.'
        login: '[AI] The command `tea issues list --login` is related to the TeaDB tool, which is a popular open-source database testing and exploration framework for PostgreSQL and MySQL databases. This specific command lists all existing issues or tests defined in a Tea project while requiring authentication using the provided login credentials. In other words, it generates a report of all test cases that are available in the specified TeaDB project, which can be accessed only after providing valid login information.'
        mentions: '[AI] The `--mentions` option in the `tea issues list` command is used to filter the output of the TeaDB query to only show issues that mention a specific keyword or phrase. This can help users quickly find and focus on issues related to their particular area of interest. For example, if you want to see only issues related to a specific library or component, you can use the `--mentions` option to search for issues containing keywords related to that library or component.'
        milestones: '[AI] The `tea issues list --milestones` command is used in the TeamFoundationServer (TFS) or Azure DevOps context to generate a list of work items that match specific milestone criteria from an Agile backlog or Scrum board. These work items represent tasks, bugs, or user stories related to a project and are tagged with specific milestones. This command helps teams identify and prioritize the items that need to be completed before reaching a particular development or release milestone.'
        output: '[AI] The `tea issues list --output` command is used in the TeaDB database tool to generate a list of identified issues or anomalies within a given dataset. This command reads data from the input source, processes it through TeaDB''s analysis engine, and outputs the results as an easy-to-read list containing relevant information about each issue such as its type, description, location, and potential impact. It helps users in identifying and resolving data quality issues efficiently.'
        page: '[AI] The `tea issues list --page` command is used in Git to display a list of issues related to a specific project, with each issue shown on a separate page. The `--page` option enables pagination, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of issues using the `Next` and `Previous` links that appear at the bottom of the output. This command is helpful for large projects with many open issues, as it allows users to easily view and manage them in smaller batches.'
        remote: '[AI] The `--remote` flag in the `tea issues list` command is used with the TeaDB (Tea Database) CLI tool to fetch issues from a remote GitHub repository instead of the local one. In other words, it allows you to query issues from another team''s or organization''s repositories by specifying their GitHub URL. This flag enhances collaboration and problem-solving across different teams or organizations using TeaDB for issue management.'
        repo: '[AI] The `tea issues list --repo` command is used in the TeaDB database management system to display a list of open issues or bugs related to a specific repository in the TeaDB project. This command retrieves data from the issue tracking system associated with TeaDB, such as GitHub or Jira, and displays information about each open issue, including its title, description, status, assignee, and priority. The `--repo` option specifies the name of the repository to query for issues.'
        state: '[AI] The `tea issues list --state` command is used in TeamFoundation Server (TFS) or Azure DevOps to display the current state of all work items in an Issues query with the Tea (Test Engineering for Agile) extension. This command helps agile teams to quickly view and understand the status of their backlog, identify blocked or in-progress issues, and coordinate efforts for resolving them.'
        until: '[AI] The `--until` option when used with Git''s `tea issues list` command is used to show only the issues (in a Teapot-tracked project) that were open before or on a specified date. For instance, if you write `tea issues list --until 2021-12-31`, the output will display all the open issues prior to or on December 31, 2021.'
