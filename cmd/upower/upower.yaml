documentation:
    command: '[AI] `upower` is a Linux utility that interacts with the system''s power management subsystem, specifically the D-Bus interface called `upowerd`. It provides a command-line interface for querying and controlling various power-related information such as battery status, power sources, and power consumption. Users can check remaining battery level, charging status, or power source in use. Developers can also use it to write custom scripts or applications that interact with the power management system.'
    flag:
        dump: '[AI] `upower --dump` is a command-line utility from the Unpowered daemon (upower) in Linux. It dumps detailed information about the power sources and consumption status of the system, including battery levels, charging status, and power adapters. The output includes fields like percentage charged, voltage, capacity, model name, and more. It provides a way for developers and users to monitor power-related data programmatically or manually from the terminal.'
        enumerate: '[AI] `upower --enumerate` is a command-line utility in Unix and Linux systems that comes with the UPower daemon. It returns information about available power sources and their current properties as JSON or XML format. The command lists all currently connected power sources, such as battery or AC power adapters, and provides details about their status (charging/discharging), capacity, percentage level, and other relevant data. This tool is often used in scripts or applications to monitor system power management.'
        help: '[AI] `upower --help` is a command-line utility for interacting with the UPower daemon, which is a system service that provides access to hardware information and power management features in Unix-based systems. The `--help` option displays detailed usage information about the `upower` command, including available subcommands (such as `list-monitors`, `dump`, or `identity-monitor`) and their corresponding options and arguments. This information helps users understand how to effectively use the `upower` tool to manage power-related settings and access hardware information.'
        monitor: '[AI] `upower --monitor` is a command-line utility provided by the UPower daemon in Linux systems. It''s used to monitor and display real-time power-related information, such as battery status (level, charging status, time remaining), connected devices, and power sources. The output shows various properties like percentage, voltage, temperature, and more for each monitored device. It provides a continuous stream of updates, making it useful for scripts or interactive monitoring of system power status.'
        monitor-detail: '[AI] `upower --monitor-detail` is a command-line utility provided by the UPower daemon in Linux systems. This command monitors and displays real-time power-related information from various devices such as batteries, AC adapters, and power supplies. The output includes detailed information like current level, percentage, capacity, time to empty/full, and power source type. The flag "--monitor-detail" ensures that the output is presented in a more detailed format for better understanding and analysis of power usage and availability in the system.'
        show-info: '[AI] `upower --show-info` is a command-line utility in the Unix-based UPower framework, which interacts with the system''s power management subsystem. This specific command retrieves and displays comprehensive details about the currently connected power sources and devices, such as their properties (online/offline status, vendor, model name), capabilities (power supply or storage), and other relevant information. It''s an essential tool for power management diagnostics and system administration.'
        version: '[AI] `upower --version` is a command used in Linux and Unix-based systems to display the version information of the upower daemon and its associated utilities. Upower is a D-Bus based power management service which gathers hardware and software information about a system''s power sources and consumption, as well as battery status. The `--version` option allows users to check the installed version of this utility, helping them ensure they have the latest version for compatibility with other applications or troubleshooting purposes.'
