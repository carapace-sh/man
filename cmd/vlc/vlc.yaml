documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vlc` is a media player software that supports various multimedia files and streaming protocols. It''s known for its versatility, as it can play both audio and video formats, as well as CDs, DVDs, and streams from the internet. The name `vlc` stands for VideoLAN Client, which is an open-source project that develops and maintains this software. To use it, simply type `vlc <file_or_stream_path>` in a terminal or command prompt to play the specified media.'
    flag:
        advanced: '[AI] `vlc --advanced` is a command-line option for VLC media player, which enables an advanced interface. This interface provides access to more features and customizations than the standard GUI. It allows users to fine-tune various aspects of the media playback such as video filters, audio effects, network streaming, and more. The `--advanced` option must be followed by other options or arguments specific to the desired functionality. For instance, `vlc --advanced --fullscreen movie.mp4` would open the advanced interface in full-screen mode when playing the "movie.mp4" file.'
        aspect-ratio: '[AI] The `--aspect-ratio` option in VLC media player is used to set or override the aspect ratio of a video being played. Aspect ratio defines the relationship between the width and height of an image, usually expressed as two numbers (e.g., 16:9 or 4:3). Using this option allows the user to maintain the original aspect ratio when playing back the media in a non-native resolution. By default, VLC tries to preserve the aspect ratio but this option can be used for manual control.'
        audio: '[AI] The `vlc --audio` command is used with VLC media player to specifically control its audio processing. The `--audio` option is followed by various sub-options to configure audio output. For instance, `vlc file.mp3 --audio-output dhdp:` sets the DHDPLL as the audio output for decoding and rendering the audio stream of "file.mp3". Other possible values include `--audio-output aout`, which selects the AOT (Advanced Output Transport) output, or `--audio-output sdl`, which selects the Simple DirectMedia Layer output. These configurations allow users to tailor VLC''s audio processing capabilities for their specific needs.'
        audio-filter: '[AI] `vlc --audio-filter` is a command-line option for VLC media player, which allows applying audio filters to the output stream. This can be used to modify the audio in various ways such as changing the equalizer preset, applying effects like reverb or distortion, or converting audio formats in real-time. The general format of this command is `vlc <media> --audio-filter <filter>`. For instance, `vlc media.mp3 --audio-filter=equalizer=presets=pop` applies the pop equalizer preset to the output audio.'
        audio-language: '[AI] The `--audio-language` option in VLC media player is used to set the preferred language for audio streams in the media file being played. When this option is specified with a valid language code, VLC will prioritize playing audio with that language over other languages. It can be helpful for users who want to ensure they are listening to audio in their desired language.'
        audio-replay-gain-default: '[AI] The `--audio-replay-gain-default` option in VLC media player sets the default behavior for applying RePlayGain volume normalization to audio files. When this option is used, VLC will apply the RePlayGain settings embedded in the audio files, ensuring consistent playback volume across different tracks.'
        audio-replay-gain-mode: '[AI] The `--audio-replay-gain-mode` flag in VLC media player is used to set the RePlayGain mode for an audio file being played. RePlayGain is a standard that enables consistent volume level between tracks or albums, regardless of their original mastering levels. This flag allows setting the mode to either "album" (default) or "track", depending on whether you want to apply the gain to the entire album or individually to each track.'
        audio-replay-gain-preamp: '[AI] The `--audio-replay-gain-preamp` option is a command-line argument for VLC media player. It enables or disables the application of ReplayGain pre-amplification to audio output. ReplayGain is an attempt to standardize volume leveling across multiple tracks and albums by embedding metadata in MP3 files. The pre-amplification factor adjusts the overall gain level of the audio to maintain a consistent perceived volume level. By default, VLC applies this setting based on the embedded metadata, but this option allows users to override it if needed.'
        audio-time-stretch: '[AI] `vlc --audio-time-stretch` is a command-line option for VLC media player used to change the tempo of an audio file without altering its pitch. The `--audio-time-stretch` flag allows users to apply time stretching or compression to the audio stream, making it faster or slower while preserving the original pitch. This feature can be useful for adjusting speech or music playback speed to suit personal preferences or accessibility needs.'
        audio-visual: '[AI] The `--audio-visual` flag in VLC media player is used to synchronize the audio and video streams during playback. When this option is enabled, VLC adjusts the playback speed of both audio and video streams to keep them perfectly in sync. This is particularly useful when playing files with mismatched timestamps or those that have audio and video streams coming from different sources.'
        auto-preparse: '[AI] The `--auto-preparse` option in VLC media player is used to preprocess and prepare input media files for playback, without actually playing the media. It analyzes the metadata of the file and creates all necessary indexes and caches to ensure smooth playback. This can be useful when dealing with large or complex media files that may take a long time to parse during regular playback. The preprocessing is typically faster since it doesn''t involve decoding or rendering frames in real-time.'
        autoscale: '[AI] The `--autoscale` flag in VLC media player is used to enable or disable automatic color scaling for SVideo and YUV input. When enabled, VLC adjusts the colors to make them more viewable on a standard RGB display. This can be useful when playing back content that may have incorrect or incomplete color information. However, it''s important to note that automatic scaling might not preserve the original colors exactly, and manual adjustments may be required for optimal results.'
        bookmark1: '[AI] The `--bookmark1` option in VLC media player is used to load a saved bookmark or save a new one. When using this option followed by a file path, VLC will load the bookmark from that file. If no file path is provided, VLC will save a new bookmark with the given name or number. This can be useful for saving and returning to specific points within a media file.'
        bookmark2: |-
            [AI] The `--bookmark2` flag is a command-line option for VLC media player, a free and open-source multimedia player. This option is used to save or load playback bookmarks in VLC.

            When the `--bookmark2` flag is followed by the `save` argument and a file path, it saves the current playback position of the media being played in the specified file. When the same flag is followed by the `load` argument and a file path, it loads the playback position saved in that file, allowing you to resume playback from where it was previously saved.
        bookmark3: '[AI] The `--bookmark3` flag in VLC media player is used to save or load a third-party playlist file called Bookmarks files. These files store specific positions and metadata (like title, artist, album) for media within the playlist. When you use the `--bookmark3` flag followed by the path to a file, VLC loads the contents of that file as bookmarks to be used in playback. If used with the `-` or no file specified, it saves the current bookmarks to a file instead.'
        bookmark4: '[AI] The `--bookmark4` option is a command-line argument for VLC media player, a free and open-source multimedia player and framework. This option allows users to save or load a bookmark file (a ".bkm" or plain text file) that contains the current playback position and other metadata of an opened media file. By saving this information, users can easily resume playback from the exact point where they left off in VLC or share their bookmarks with others for synchronization purposes.'
        bookmark5: '[AI] The `--bookmark5` flag is a command-line option for VLC media player. It allows saving or loading a bookmark (saved playback position) for a media file at a specific fifth of the media''s duration. For example, `vlc media_file.mp4 --bookmark5=0.25 --run-time=3:15.0` sets the bookmark to 25% of the media''s total length (equivalent to 3 minutes and 15 seconds). Use it with the `--save-bookmarks` option to save, or with `--load-bookmark` to load, a specific bookmark.'
        bookmark6: '[AI] The `--bookmark6` option in VLC media player is used to load a bookmark file containing positions and titles of previously saved media playback sessions. When this option is provided along with a valid bookmark file as an argument, VLC will open the media files associated with each bookmark and restore their playback positions. This feature can be useful for quickly resuming playback from where it was left off in multiple media files.'
        bookmark7: '[AI] The `--bookmark` option in VLC media player is used to save or load playback positions, also known as bookmarks. The `--bookmark7` is a specific variant of this option that saves or loads bookmarks for up to seven different media files. When used with the `--save` or `--load` argument followed by a file path, it allows you to save or load multiple bookmarks in a single file, each corresponding to a different media file.'
        bookmark8: '[AI] The `--bookmark8` option in VLC media player is used to save or load a specific playback position of a media file as a bookmark. When using the save function (e.g., `vlc file --bookmark8 my_bookmark`), it creates or updates a bookmark with the given name "my\_bookmark" for the specified media file. The load function (e.g., `vlc file --bookmark8 my_bookmark`) recalls and resumes playback from that saved position. This feature can be helpful when watching long media files and wanting to easily return to a specific point.'
        bookmark9: '[AI] The `--bookmark9` option is a command-line argument for VLC media player. It is used to load a saved bookmark file, which contains the playback position and other information of a media file that was previously played in VLC. By using this option followed by the path to the bookmark file, VLC will resume playing the media from the saved position.'
        bookmark10: '[AI] The `--bookmark10` option is a command-line argument for VLC media player. It allows you to set or load a bookmark, which is a saved position in a media file, specifically the 10th one (index starts at 0). This can be useful for quickly navigating to frequently used locations within long media files.'
        config: '[AI] The `--config` option in VLC media player is used to specify a custom configuration file. This flag allows users to override the default settings of VLC with their own preferences, such as codecs, user interfaces, or input/output modules. By providing a path to a valid VLC configuration file, the user can customize various aspects of the media player''s behavior.'
        control: '[AI] `vlc --control` is a command-line option used with VLC media player to enable Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface for controlling media playback and interacting with the player''s user interface programmatically. This flag allows other applications or scripts to communicate with VLC, issuing commands like playing, pausing, or changing the current media. It''s essential for advanced use cases, automation, and integration with other software.'
        crop: '[AI] `vlc` is a media player software, and its command-line option `--crop` is used to set custom aspect ratios or crop areas for video output. By using this option followed by specifying the desired width:height ratio or x,y-coordinates and widthxheight dimensions, you can change the displayed aspect ratio of the media file. For instance, `vlc file.mp4 --crop 16:9` sets a 16:9 aspect ratio for the output, while `vlc file.mp4 --crop 10,10,256x144` sets the crop area starting at x=10, y=10 with a width of 256 pixels and a height of 144 pixels.'
        custom-aspect-ratios: |-
            [AI] `vlc --custom-aspect-ratios` is a command-line option used with VLC media player to specify custom aspect ratios for videos. When a video file is played, its native aspect ratio may not match the display aspect ratio, leading to distorted images or black bars appearing on the sides of the screen.

            Using `--custom-aspect-ratios`, users can manually set desired aspect ratios to optimize video playback for their specific displays. The option takes a comma-separated list of aspect ratios in the format "width:height". For example, `--custom-aspect-ratios=16:9` sets the player to display videos in the 16:9 aspect ratio.

            It's important to note that setting an incorrect aspect ratio may result in distorted or misaligned video content. Properly configuring this option can help improve viewing experiences on various displays, such as televisions and monitors.
        custom-crop-ratios: |-
            [AI] The `--custom-crop-ratios` option is a feature of VLC media player, a popular open-source multimedia player and streaming media server. This option allows users to define custom crop ratios for video output, enabling them to adjust the aspect ratio or crop the video content as per their preference.

            By using `--custom-crop-ratios`, users can specify one or more sets of new aspect ratios using a semicolon (;) separated list. Each set consists of two numbers representing the width and height ratio, such as "16:9" or "4:3". VLC media player will then apply these custom crop ratios to the video output during playback. This can be useful for ensuring consistent aspect ratio presentation across different video files or display devices with varying aspect ratios.
        deinterlace: |-
            [AI] The `--deinterlace` option in VLC media player is used to enable deinterlacing of interlaced video content. Interlacing is a method of displaying video where each frame is divided into two fields, with the even-numbered lines in one field and odd-numbered lines in another. This can lead to visual artifacts when upscaling or playing back on progressive displays.

            The `--deinterlace` option instructs VLC to apply deinterlacing algorithms to remove these artifacts and produce a more natural, progressive scan image. It supports various deinterlacing methods such as Bob, Weave, MPEG-2, and Yadif, which can be selected using additional options or the default method is used if no option is specified.
        deinterlace-mode: '[AI] The `--deinterlace-mode` option in VLC media player is used to control the deinterlacing method for output when playing interlaced video content. Interlaced videos were common in older broadcast and analog formats, and they display each frame as two separate fields (even and odd), which can result in visible lines or "comb" effect when displayed on progressive displays. VLC offers several deinterlacing methods such as "Bob", "Weave", "Interpolate" and "Adaptive" to remove this effect and present the video correctly on progressive displays. The best choice depends on the specific video content and display capabilities.'
        dvd: '[AI] The command `vlc --dvd` is used in VLC media player to open a DVD as a source. The `--dvd` argument instructs VLC to play a DVD, rather than a file. This can be used with the path to a DVD drive or ISO image file, for example: `vlc --dvd /dev/sr0`. The DVD will be mounted and played in VLC.'
        extraintf: '[AI] The `--extraintf` option in VLC media player is used to specify an external filter graph description file, containing a chain of filters to be applied to the input media. This allows for advanced processing of media files beyond the built-in functionality of VLC, such as applying decoders or transformations not available in the default setup. The file extension for these descriptions is typically `.filt` or `.vfilt`. Using this option enables more complex and customized media processing.'
        extrashort-jump-size: '[AI] The `--extrashort-jump-size` option in VLC media player is used to set a smaller size for the extra short seek steps. This can improve the seeking performance, especially when dealing with large files or when seeking to a specific point rapidly. By default, VLC uses a jump size of 1 second, but you can use this option to set a smaller value in microseconds or milliseconds. For example, `--extrashort-jump-size 50000` sets the extra short seek steps to 50ms. This can be helpful for fine-grained seeking in long media files.'
        force-dolby-surround: '[AI] The `--force-dolby-surround` option is a command-line argument used with VLC media player, an open-source and cross-platform multimedia player and streaming media server. This flag forces VLC to decode and output Dolby Surround audio format, even if the input file does not explicitly indicate this format. It enables the decoding of Dolby Surround soundtracks from various sources like DVDs, ISO files, or streamed content, ensuring optimal playback for viewers with compatible home theater systems.'
        full-help: '[AI] `vlc --full-help` is a command used in VLC media player to display detailed information about all its options and features. The "--full-help" option is designed to provide a comprehensive list of every available option, along with their descriptions and usage examples. This can be helpful for users who want to explore the advanced functionality of VLC or need assistance when using specific features.'
        fullscreen: '[AI] The `--fullscreen` option for VLC media player is used to maximize the video or movie being played to fill the entire screen. When this command is given with the VLC media player, it starts the media in full-screen mode. For example, `vlc --fullscreen movie.mp4` will open and play the "movie.mp4" file in full-screen mode.'
