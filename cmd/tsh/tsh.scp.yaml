documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tsh scp` command is used in the Tiger Shawnee (TSH) shell for secure file transfer between two Unix systems or hosts using the SCP (Secure Copy) protocol. It transfers files from a local source to a remote destination while encrypting the data during transmission, ensuring secure and reliable transfer. The basic syntax is `tsh scp <local_file> <username@remote_host>:<remote_destination>` or `tsh scp <username@remote_host>:<remote_source> <local_destination>`.'
    flag:
        cluster: |-
            [AI] The `tsh scp --cluster` command is a part of Tectonic, a Kubernetes platform from CoreOS. It is used to copy files between nodes in a Kubernetes cluster using the Tectonic CLI (`tsh`) and SCP (Secure Copy) protocol.

            The `--cluster` flag specifies that the command should be executed against the entire Kubernetes cluster managed by Tectonic, rather than a specific node. The `scp` subcommand then performs the file transfer operation using SSH keys for authentication and encryption.

            In summary, `tsh scp --cluster <source> <destination>` copies files securely between nodes in a Tectonic-managed Kubernetes cluster.
        no-preserve: '[AI] The command `tsh scp --no-preserve` is using the TSECSH (Tight Security Shell) `scp` (Secure Copy) command with the option `--no-preserve`. This option instructs TSCP not to preserve symbolic links during file transfers. With this option, only the actual files are copied and not any linked data or shortcuts, ensuring a more secure transfer by avoiding unintended transfer of potentially sensitive symbolic links.'
        no-quiet: |-
            [AI] The `tsh` command in this context is likely a reference to the Tenable Security Center (TSC) CLI tool. The specific command, `tsh scp --no-quiet`, is used for secure copying (SCP) file transfer between a local system and a remote host managed by Tenable SC.

            The `--no-quiet` option modifies the behavior of the SCP command to provide verbose output during the file transfer process, ensuring that users are kept informed of the progress and any potential errors that may occur. Without this flag, the command would run silently, which could be desirable for automation purposes but might not be ideal for interactive usage or troubleshooting.
        no-recursive: |-
            [AI] The `tsh` command in this context is likely a reference to the TSecure Shell (TSH) terminal emulator for TCP/IP connections. The `scp` (secure copy) is a command used within TSH for transferring files between hosts securely.

            The option `--no-recursive` is used with the `scp` command to prevent file transfers that include subdirectories or their contents recursively. This means only the specified files, not their subdirectories and files contained therein, will be transferred during the command execution.
        port: '[AI] The `tsh` (Telnet-like Secure SHell) command `scp` (Secure Copy) with the flag `--port` is used to specify a custom SSH port number for the secure file transfer over SSH. This option enables connecting to an SSH server running on a non-standard default port, which can help bypass certain security restrictions or access remote servers more discreetly. For example, `tsh scp --port 2222 user@remote_host:/path/to/file`.'
        preserve: '[AI] The `tsh` (Tarball Shell) command `scp` with the option `--preserve` is used for copying files between hosts while preserving their modification and access times, and permissions. This means that the copied file will have the same last modification time, access time, and file permissions as the original file. It''s a useful option when you want to maintain the metadata of the files during transfer.'
        quiet: |-
            [AI] The command `tsh scp --quiet` is a part of the Tectia secure file transfer solution (TSH), which is used to securely transfer files between Unix systems using SCP (Secure Copy) protocol.

            The `--quiet` option instructs TSH to run in quiet mode, suppressing progress messages and other informational output during the file transfer process. This can be useful when automating scripts or running transfers in a batch environment, where excessive output can clutter the console or logs.

            In summary, `tsh scp --quiet` is used to perform secure file transfers with TSH while minimizing output for a quieter experience.
        recursive: |-
            [AI] The `tsh` command in this context is likely referring to the Tectrosha Shell (Tsh), a Unix-style shell developed by Tectrosha Inc. for IBM Power Systems.

            The `scp` command under `tsh` stands for Secure Copy, which is a utility used for copying files between two networked hosts in a secure manner using SSH protocol.

            The option `--recursive` is used with `scp` to perform a recursive file transfer, meaning it copies not only the specified files and directories but also all their contents, including subdirectories, within them. This flag is useful when you want to copy an entire directory tree from one host to another.
