description: describe all known top-level flags
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `wire flags` command is used in Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language) simulation to display or modify the simulation flags for the selected wires or signals in the current design. It is typically invoked using the `$display()` or `$dumpfile()` system tasks with the `flags` argument set to a specific value, such as "h" for waveform viewing or "w" for showing waveforms in tabular format. The command does not modify the actual wires or signals but rather alters how they are displayed during simulation for better visualization and understanding of their behavior.'
