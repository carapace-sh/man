        [AI] `pip cache` is a sub-command of `pip`, which is a package manager for Python. It manages and stores downloaded packages in a local cache, allowing faster installation and reinstallation of those packages without having to redownload them from the internet.

        The `pip cache` command itself has several uses:

        1. `pip cache --clear`: Clears the entire local cache, removing all downloaded package files. This can be useful when you want to start fresh with a clean slate or when you encounter issues with corrupted cache files.
        2. `pip cache show [package-name]`: Displays detailed information about a specific cached package, including its version and file size.
        3. `pip cache list`: Lists all the cached packages along with their versions and file sizes. This can be helpful when you want to see what packages are currently stored in your local cache or when you need to free up disk space by deleting older or unused package versions.
        4. By default, `pip cache` does not display any output as it is typically used as a behind-the-scenes tool for other pip commands that manage the cache.
