documentation:
    command: '[AI] "Gatsby" is a free and open-source framework based on React for building blazing fast, modern websites and apps. It features a GraphQL data layer, which pulls in data from various sources like headless CMSs or APIs and makes it available to the React components in your project. The result is efficient and dynamic web experiences. Gatsby can be used for static site generation or server-side rendering, supports progressive web apps (PWA), and has a large community and ecosystem. To use Gatsby, you would install the CLI, create a new project, build and deploy your website.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `gatsby --help` is a command used with GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator built with React. The `--help` flag displays comprehensive information about available Gatsby CLI (Command Line Interface) commands, their usage, and options to the user. It''s an essential tool for discovering how to use Gatsby effectively, including creating new sites, developing existing projects, and building and deploying your site.'
        json: '[AI] The `gatsby --json` command is used to run Gatsby in headless mode and return JSON data from the GraphQL endpoint. This can be useful for fetching data programmatically or integrating with external systems. By default, it outputs the site''s data but you can also query specific parts of your GraphQL schema using arguments. The command should be run from the root directory of your Gatsby project and does not generate HTML files or start a local development server.'
        no-color: '[AI] The `gatsby --no-color` command is used with GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator for React projects. This command line argument disables colored output in the CLI (Command Line Interface) during the build process. It''s particularly useful for those who prefer to work in terminal environments without colors or when using automated scripts where colorful output might not be desirable.'
        no-colors: '[AI] `gatsby --no-colors` is a command used with GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator built with React. The `--no-colors` flag is an option that disables the usage of colors in the terminal output during the build process. It''s primarily useful for users who prefer a text-only output or are working in environments where colored output may not be supported or preferred, such as when using screen readers or non-graphical terminals.'
        verbose: '[AI] `gatsby --verbose` is a command used in GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator. This command runs Gatsby in production mode with increased output, displaying more detailed information about the build process in the console. It''s useful for debugging and understanding the inner workings of Gatsby during builds.'
        version: '[AI] `gatsby --version` is a command used in the Gatsby JavaScript framework to check and display the currently installed version of Gatsby in your terminal or command prompt. This command helps developers verify they have the correct version of Gatsby installed for their project and ensures compatibility with other dependencies.'
