documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux next-layout` command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, cycles through the defined layouts of your TMUX sessions in a clockwise direction. Each layout represents a different arrangement of windows or panes within a session. This command allows you to easily switch between these predefined configurations for better organization and management of your multiple tasks within a single terminal window.'
    flag:
        t: '[AI] The `tmux next-layout -t` command in Tmux is used to switch to the next layout in the specified window tab `-t <tab>`. A layout in Tmux refers to a specific arrangement of panes within a window. By default, Tmux uses a single-window, full-screen layout. However, with the `next-layout` command, you can cycle through other predefined layouts such as splitting the window into two or more panes horizontally or vertically. This command is useful when working on multiple tasks in different panes and allows for efficient multitasking within a single terminal session.'
