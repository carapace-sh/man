documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `link` command in Unix-based systems is used to create or manage symbolic links (also called soft links). A symbolic link is a special type of file that points to another file or directory in the file system. When you access a symbolic link, the operating system behaves as if you have accessed the original file or directory directly. The basic syntax for creating a symbolic link is `link source target`, where `source` is the existing file or directory, and `target` is the desired name of the new symbolic link. For example, `link myfile newlink` creates a new symbolic link named "newlink" that points to the file "myfile". To remove a symbolic link, use the `rm` command with the `-r` flag: `rm -r target`, where `target` is the name of the symbolic link.'
    flag:
        help: |-
            [AI] `flag "link" in Go's `go build` or `go run` commands is used to create and manage links between a go.mod file and the dependencies it specifies. The `--help` flag provides information about the available options for the `link` command, including:

            - `-f`, or `--follow`: Resolves dependencies recursively instead of linking only directly-specified packages.
            - `-H`, or `--build-constraints`: Applies specific build constraints during linking.
            - `-change`, `-increment`, and `-lockfile`: Used for working with the vendor directory and managing dependencies in a more fine-grained manner.

            For more detailed information, use `go help link`.
        version: '[AI] `flag "link --version"` is not a standalone command or flag, but rather an argument used with the GNU Make build system tool, specifically the `link` rule, to display the version information of the linker being used in the build process. When executed as part of a Makefile target, it will print out the version number and other relevant information about the linker (usually `ld` on Unix-based systems), allowing users to verify which linker is being used for their project and its corresponding version.'
