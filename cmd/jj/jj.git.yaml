        [AI] The command "jj git" is not a standard Git command. It seems to be a combination of two different tools: JJ (Just Jenkins) and Git.

        JJ is a command-line tool for interacting with Jenkins, a continuous integration and delivery tool. It allows users to execute Jenkins jobs and view their builds without having to access the Jenkins web interface directly.

        The "git" part of the command suggests that this command might be using Git as a source control system for Jenkins jobs. However, without more context, it's difficult to say for certain what this command does specifically. It may be used to fetch or push Jenkins job configurations from or to a Git repository.

        For more information on using JJ with Git, please refer to the official documentation of both tools: https://jenkinsci.github.io/just-jenkins/#_git_integration and https://git-scm.com/doc.
