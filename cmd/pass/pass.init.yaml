documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "pass" command with the "init" argument is a part of Password Store, a cross-platform password manager created by JÃ¸rn Ditlevsen. The "init" option initializes or sets up a new Pass database. When run in an empty directory, it creates necessary files and directories for the database. It also sets the required access control permissions. This command is typically used during the initial setup of a new Pass database.'
    flag:
        path: '[AI] The `--path` option in the `pass init` command is used to specify the directory path where Pass, a password manager by Google, should initialize its data files and configuration. When you run `pass init` without the `--path` argument, it initializes Pass in the default directory. Providing a custom path with `--path` lets you choose where to store your Pass data.'
