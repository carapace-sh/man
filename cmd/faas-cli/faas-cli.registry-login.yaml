description: Generate and save the registry authentication file
flags:
    --account-id=: Your AWS Account id
    --ecr: If we are using ECR we need a different set of flags, so if this is set, we need to set --username and --password
    --password=: The registry password
    --region=: Your AWS region
    --server=: The server URL, it is defaulted to the docker registry
    -s, --password-stdin: Reads the docker password from stdin, either pipe to the command or remember to press ctrl+d when reading interactively
    -u, --username=: The Registry Username
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `faas-cli registry-login` is a command used with the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) CLI tool to authenticate and log in to a specific container registry, such as Docker Hub or Amazon ECR. This allows you to easily deploy your functions as containers to these registries for further deployment and execution using FaaS platforms like OpenFaas, AWS Lambda, etc. The command typically requires a registry URL and login credentials (username and password or token) as arguments.'
    flag:
        account-id: '[AI] The `faas-cli registry-login --account-id` command is used in Faas (Function as a Service) technology to log in to a container registry using an account ID. This command is run within the Faas CLI (Command Line Interface) tool and authenticates the user with the specified account ID for accessing and pulling images from the registry, enabling deployment and execution of serverless functions.'
        ecr: '[AI] The `faas-cli registry-login --ecr` command is used with the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) CLI tool to login to an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) in order to push and pull Docker containers. The `--ecr` flag indicates that the specified registry is an ECR registry. This command sets up authentication between your local machine and the specified ECR registry, allowing you to easily deploy your functions as containers using FaaS platforms like OpenFaaS or FnProject.'
        password: '[AI] The `faas-cli registry-login --password` command is used in the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) tooling provided by OpenFaaS. This specific command logs in to a Docker registry using a password, enabling the Faas-cli tool to pull images from that registry for further deployment and management of serverless functions. It''s an essential step when working with containerized functions and private registries.'
        password-stdin: |-
            [AI] `faas-cli registry-login` is a command from the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) CLI tool. This command is used to log in to a container registry, such as Docker Hub or Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), using standard input for the password.

            The `--password-stdin` flag instructs the command to read the password from the standard input stream instead of asking for it interactively or taking it as an argument. This can be useful in automated scripts or continuous integration and deployment pipelines where passwords should not be hardcoded or exposed in plain text.

            When running this command, you'll need to have your registry URL and your login credentials (username and password) available. You can either set up environment variables or pass them as arguments, but the password should be provided via standard input using a tool like `echo` or `cat`. For example:

            ```sh
            $ echo "my_password" | faas-cli registry-login my_registry_url --username my_username --password-stdin
            ```

            This command logs in to the specified registry using the given username and password read from standard input.
        region: '[AI] The `faas-cli registry-login --region` command is used with the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) CLI tool to log in to a specific region of a container registry, such as Docker Hub or Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and store the authentication credentials for later use. The `--region` flag specifies the name of the region to which you want to login. This command helps simplify the process of providing authentication details every time you push or pull images from that registry in that region, improving overall workflow efficiency.'
        server: '[AI] `faas-cli registry-login --server` is a command used with the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) CLI tool to authenticate and log in to a container registry, such as Docker Hub or Amazon ECR, using the provided server URL. This command sets up the authentication context for subsequent Faas-related tasks, like deploying functions, by configuring the CLI with the necessary access credentials.'
        username: |-
            [AI] The `faas-cli registry-login --username` command is used to log in to a container registry using the FaaS CLI (Function as a Service Command Line Interface) tool.

            The `registry-login` subcommand initiates the login process, while the `--username` option specifies the Docker Hub or other registry username to be used during the authentication. The command prompts for the password associated with the specified username when run, and stores the credentials securely in a configuration file for future use, enabling you to easily push and pull container images from your chosen registry.
