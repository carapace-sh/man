documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `git config` command is used to configure Git, a popular version control system. Specifically, the `set` subcommand is used to set or update a Git configuration variable. For example, `git config set user.name "John Doe"` sets the name of the author for your Git commits, and `git config set user.email john.doe@example.com` sets the email address associated with those commits. In general, the `set` command follows the syntax `git config [--global] set <key> <value>`, where `<key>` is the name of the configuration variable and `<value>` is the value you want to assign to it.'
