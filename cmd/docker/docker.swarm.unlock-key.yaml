documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker swarm unlock-key` is a command used in Docker Swarm mode to manage encryption keys for secure communication between nodes in a Swarm cluster. The command decrypts and reveals an existing encrypted key, allowing it to be used for authenticating nodes and joining them to the Swarm cluster. This helps maintain security by ensuring that only trusted nodes can communicate and participate in the cluster.'
    flag:
        quiet: '[AI] The `docker swarm unlock-key` command is used to decrypt and reveal a Swarm keyfile, which is required for managing a Docker Swarm cluster using the Swarm keyword authentication. The `--quiet` flag is an optional argument that suppresses all output except for error messages. When this option is used, the command will run silently without displaying any informational or success messages. This can be useful when running scripts or automation tasks where only errors need to be reported.'
        rotate: '[AI] The `docker swarm unlock-key --rotate` command is used in Docker Swarm to manage and rotate the secure key used for joining nodes to a Swarm cluster. This command generates a new encryption key and updates the key on all managed nodes, ensuring that only the latest and most secure key is being used for securing the Swarm cluster communications. By default, it will save the new key in the `$HOME/.docker/swarm` directory on Linux systems, and the new key will be required to join or manage nodes within the Swarm cluster.'
