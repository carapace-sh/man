        [AI] `envsubst` is a command-line utility from the GNU `gettext` package used for expanding environment variables within text files. It reads input from standard input or a file, and substitutes variable references with their corresponding values from the environment. The syntax typically involves piping a file to `envsubst` with the option `--expand-tabs`, followed by an at sign (@) symbol and the name of the environment variable. For example:

        ```bash
        cat myfile.txt | envsubst --expand-tabs=@MYVAR > newfile.txt
        ```

        This command will substitute all occurrences of `@MYVAR` in `myfile.txt` with the value of the `MYVAR` environment variable before writing the result to `newfile.txt`.

        help: |-
            [AI] `envsubst --help` is a command in GNU Gettext used for expanding environment variables in files. The help option (--help) displays detailed usage information, including supported options and examples. Key features include:

            - Replacing occurrences of variables in files with their values from the environment.
            - Supports recursion through Makefiles and other files that contain `$(SHELL) envsubst ...` commands.
            - Can be used with regular expressions to match multiple variable occurrences within a file.
            - Optionally, can preserve backslashes before variables or escape characters in the output.
        variables: '[AI] `envsubst` is a GNU `sed` utility used to substitute environment variable values into text files. The `--variables` option tells `envsubst` to only process variables that are defined in the current shell environment. This means that only variables whose values can be accessed using the `$VARNAME` syntax in the shell will be substituted. If no options are provided, `envsubst` will substitute all variables found in the file.'
        version: '[AI] `envsubst --version` is a command used in the GNU Gettext utility package. It replaces occurrences of environment variables in files with their values. The `--version` option is used to display the version number of the envsubst command being used. So, running this command will output the version information for the installed instance of envsubst.'
