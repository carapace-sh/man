    command: '[AI] The `docker buildx du` command is used with Docker Buildx, an extension of Docker that adds support for building multi-stage builds and other advanced features using multiple buildworkers. This specific command displays the disk usage statistics for each buildx build node in your system. It helps you to monitor the storage usage and manage resources efficiently by identifying which nodes are consuming more space.'

            [AI] `docker buildx du --filter` is a command used in Docker Buildx, an extension of Docker that adds support for building multi-stage builds using multiple buildx contexts.

            The `du` subcommand stands for "disk usage" and is used to report the disk usage statistics for individual build contexts. The `--filter` option filters the output based on specified criteria, such as a specific build context name or a regular expression pattern in the context path.

            For example, `docker buildx du --filter="my-context"` will display the disk usage information only for the build context named "my-context", while `docker buildx du --filter="^my-project-.*"` will display the information for all contexts whose names start with "my-project-".
        verbose: '[AI] `docker buildx du --verbose` is a command used with Docker Buildx, which is a powerful Docker tool for building images using multiple buildx contexts and workers. The command `du` stands for "disk usage," and it is used to display detailed disk usage statistics for the buildx contexts. The `--verbose` flag increases the output verbosity of the command, providing more detailed information about each context''s disk usage, including the path to the context directory, the number of builds, the total layer size, and more.'
