description: Vendor all module dependencies into the _vendor directory.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `hugo mod vendor` command is used in Hugo, a popular static site generator, to move third-party dependencies from composer.lock and go.sum files into the vendor directory. This action helps manage and keep track of dependency versions within a specific project environment. It also makes the project portable and isolates it from other projects that might have different dependencies.'
