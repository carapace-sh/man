        [AI] The `nmcli` (NetworkManager Command-Line Interface) `device wifi hotspot` command is used to configure a Wi-Fi interface as a hotspot, or a wireless access point. This allows other devices to connect to the network being managed by this interface via Wi-Fi.

        Here's a brief explanation of its usage:

        1. Connect to your network manager profile if you are not already connected. For example, `nmcli connection up id <your_connection>`. Replace `<your_connection>` with the name or UUID of your existing connection profile.

        2. Enable the Wi-Fi interface and bring it up: `nmcli device wifi rescan` followed by `nmcli device wifi connect <SSID> password <PASSWORD>`. Replace `<SSID>` and `<PASSWORD>` with the name of your wireless network and its password, respectively.

        3. Configure the hotspot: `nmcli device wifi-hotspot set <device_name> mode ap ssid <SSID> password <PASSWORD>`. Replace `<device_name>`, `<SSID>`, and `<PASSWORD>` with the desired name for your hotspot, its SSID, and a secure password.

        4. Start the hotspot: `nmcli device wifi-hotspot on <interface_name>`. Replace `<interface_name>` with the name of the interface you want to use as a hotspot (e.g., 'wlan0' or 'wlp3s0').

        5. Check the status: `nmcli device wifi-hotspot status <interface_name>`. Replace `<interface_name>` with the name of your interface.

        Keep in mind that depending on your system configuration, you might need administrative privileges to execute these commands.
