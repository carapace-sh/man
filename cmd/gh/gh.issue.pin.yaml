    command: '[AI] The `gh issue pin` command is used with the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) to pin an issue in a repository. This action keeps the issue at the top of the list when viewing issues, making it easily accessible and visible. By using this command, you can prioritize specific issues over others in your project. The general format of the command is `gh issue pin <issue-number>`, replacing `<issue-number>` with the number of the issue you want to pin.'
