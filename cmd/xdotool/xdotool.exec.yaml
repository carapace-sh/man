        [AI] `xdotool exec` is a command-line tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical environment in Linux and Unix-like systems. The "exec" part of the command refers to executing a specific action or command on an X window or application.

        When you use `xdotool exec`, followed by the name of an X window or process ID (PID), and then a series of actions enclosed in quotes, you're instructing xdotool to perform those actions on that window or application. For example:

        `xdotool exec --class "Firefox" search --name "Google" send_keys "example query"`

        This command opens the Firefox web browser and types the word "example query" into the Google search box. The available actions include moving, resizing, focusing, sending keys, taking screenshots, and more.

            [AI] `xdotool exec --sync` is a command-line utility used in Linux and Unix systems for automating interactions with the graphical user interface (GUI). The `--sync` option ensures that xdotool waits for the executed command to finish before moving on to the next one, providing synchronous execution.

            The `exec` keyword specifies that the following command is to be run in the context of the current xdotool session. When used with `--sync`, it guarantees that the entire script or sequence of commands completes atomically, which can be essential for reliable automation tasks.
