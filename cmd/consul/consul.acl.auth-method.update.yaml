        kubernetes-ca-cert: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method update --kubernetes-ca-cert` command is used to configure Consul''s Access Control List (ACL) system to use authentication based on Kubernetes Identity and Access Management (IAM). Specifically, it updates the authentication method with a new Kubernetes Certificate Authority (CA) certificate. The CA certificate is required for Consul to trust the client certificates issued by Kubernetes when making authenticated requests to protected resources. This command helps to securely integrate Consul ACL and Kubernetes IAM for managing access control across both platforms.'
        kubernetes-host: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl auth-method update --kubernetes-host` command is used to update the authentication method for Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Hashicorp Consul, specifically for the Kubernetes authenticator.

            Consul's ACL system manages access control policies for securing its various services, such as Key Value Store, HTTP Proxy, and other components. The authentication methods define how Consul verifies the identity of clients before they can access protected resources.

            The `--kubernetes-host` flag refers to the location of the Kubernetes API server, which is used by the Kubernetes authenticator to handle authentication requests. When this command is executed, it updates the configuration for the Kubernetes authenticator in Consul with the new Kubernetes host information. This ensures that Consul can communicate with the Kubernetes cluster to authenticate clients.

            In summary, `consul acl auth-method update --kubernetes-host` is a command used to configure and update the authentication method for Consul's Access Control Lists using the Kubernetes authenticator, by specifying the location of the Kubernetes API server.
        kubernetes-service-account-jwt: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl auth-method update` command is used to configure authentication methods in Hashicorp Consul's Access Control List (ACL) system. The specific flag `--kubernetes-service-account-jwt` indicates that the chosen authentication method is based on Kubernetes Service Account JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

            When this method is enabled, Consul can authenticate requests based on valid JWT tokens issued by a Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) or Cluster Role. These tokens contain information about the requesting service account, including its namespace and name, which can be used to control access to Consul resources through ACL policies.

            In summary, this command updates the Consul ACL system to use Kubernetes Service Account JWT for authentication.
        max-token-ttl: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl auth-method update --max-token-ttl` command is used to update the maximum token Time To Live (TTL) setting for an Authentication Method in Consul's Access Control List (ACL).

            Consul is a popular service discovery, configuration, and orchestration tool. Its ACL feature allows you to control access to various resources in your Consul environment. Authentication methods define how Consul authenticates clients and issues tokens for secure communication.

            The `--max-token-ttl` option sets the maximum validity period (in seconds) for tokens issued by this specific authentication method. This can be used as an additional security measure to limit the lifespan of tokens, making it harder for unauthorized users to gain access to your Consul resources.

            In summary, the `consul acl auth-method update --max-token-ttl` command updates the maximum token TTL for an existing authentication method in Consul's ACL system.
        meta: '[AI] The `flag "consul acl auth-method update --meta"` is used in Consul Access Control List (ACL) configuration to update the authentication method metadata for an existing ACL rule. This flag is specific to Consul''s ACL subsystem, which manages access control policies for secure communication between services and clients. Updating the authentication method metadata allows you to modify how Consul verifies the identity of principals (entities granted permissions) when they make requests protected by the ACL rule.'
        name: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method update` command with the `--name` option is used to update an authentication method''s configuration in the Consul Access Control List (ACL) system. This command modifies the attributes of an existing authentication method, such as its name, type, or key/value pairs, depending on the specific implementation of the authentication method being used. Updating the authentication method configuration allows for changes to be made to how Consul authenticates clients and enforces access policies.'
        namespace: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method update --namespace` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command updates the authentication method for Access Control Lists (ACLs) within a specific namespace in Consul. The updated authentication method can be a token, certificate, or other supported methods for granting access to resources managed by Consul.'
        no-merge: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl auth-method update --no-merge` command is used to update an authentication method in Consul's Access Control List (ACL) with no merge of existing configurations.

            Consul ACL allows managing access to different resources within the Consul cluster using various authentication methods, such as token, username/password, or other third-party providers like LDAP or OIDC.

            When you run `consul acl auth-method update`, it updates the configuration for an existing authentication method. By adding the `--no-merge` flag to this command, you instruct Consul not to merge any changes with the current configuration of that method; instead, the entire new configuration will replace the old one.

            This can be useful when you want to make significant changes to your authentication method setup without having to worry about maintaining the existing settings or dealing with potential conflicts between the new and old configurations.
        stale: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method update --stale` command is used to update an authentication method in the Consul Access Control List (ACL) with stale or outdated tokens allowed. When this option is set, Consul will allow updating the authentication method without checking for the validity of existing tokens, which can be useful when migrating to a new authentication backend or making other significant changes. It''s important to note that using this option may introduce security risks if outdated tokens are still in use, so it should only be used during controlled updates and migrations.'
        tls-server-name: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl auth-method update --tls-server-name` command is used to update an Authentication Method in Consul Access Control List (ACL) with TLS server name configuration.

            Consul ACL manages access to the Consul API and is secured using TLS. With this command, you can configure the TLS server name for an authentication method, allowing secure communication between Consul and clients that use specific server names in their TLS certificates.

            Updating the TLS server name ensures secure communications by validating the client's certificate against the specified server name during the authentication process. This additional layer of security helps protect your Consul infrastructure from unauthorized access.
        token: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method update --token` command is used to update an authentication method in Hashicorp Consul Access Control List (ACL) using an API token. This command interacts with the Consul ACL system, which is responsible for managing access control policies in Consul. Updating an authentication method involves modifying its settings or configuration, and this command provides a way to do that programmatically through the Consul API. The `--token` argument specifies the API token required for authentication when making requests to the Consul server.'
        token-file: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl auth-method update --token-file` command is used to update an authentication method in Hashicorp Consul Access Control List (ACL) using a personal access token stored in a file.

            Consul ACL manages access control for Consul services, key/value stores, and other resources. Authentication methods define how Consul verifies the identity of clients connecting to these resources.

            The command takes the following arguments:

            - `update`: Specifies that an existing authentication method should be updated.
            - `--token-file`: Provides the path to a file containing the personal access token for the Consul client making this API call.

            When executed, this command updates the specified authentication method with the new configuration, and any changes take effect immediately.
        token-locality: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl auth-method update --token-locality` command is used to update an authentication method's token locality setting in Consul's Access Control List (ACL) system.

            Consul ACL allows you to control access to your services, configuration, and other resources through the use of policies and tokens. Authentication methods define how Consul verifies the identity of entities requesting access.

            `--token-locality` is an option for specific authentication methods that support it. It determines where the token should be located - either in a header or query parameter when making requests to Consul. By updating this setting, you can modify the location of the token for the specified authentication method.
