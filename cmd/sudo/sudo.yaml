documentation:
    command: '[AI] `sudo` is a utility in Unix and Linux operating systems that allows users to execute commands with the security privileges of another user, typically the superuser (root). The name `sudo` stands for "superuser do." When a command is preceded by `sudo`, it will prompt for the password of the root user before executing the command. This is useful for granting specific administrative tasks to trusted users without giving them permanent root access.'
    flag:
        askpass: '[AI] `sudo --askpass` is a feature in the sudo package that allows users to run commands with elevated privileges (as the superuser or another user) after being prompted for their password. The `--askpass` option tells sudo to use an external program as a helper to read and forward the user''s password securely instead of echoing it on the terminal. This is particularly useful when using non-interactive shell sessions, such as SSH or automated scripts, where the password would be visible in plain text.'
        background: '[AI] The `sudo` command with the `--background` option is used to run a command as a superuser in the background. When you execute `sudo --background <command>`, the terminal does not wait for the command to finish before returning control to you, allowing you to continue working in your current terminal session. This can be useful when running long-running or resource-intensive tasks that don''t require your immediate attention.'
        bell: '[AI] The `sudo --bell` command is a option for the `sudo` (Short for SuperUser DO) utility in Unix-based systems. It produces a bell or beep sound when a user enters an incorrect password during the sudo authentication process. This can help alert the user if they have made a mistake while entering their password, making it easier to correct and avoid repeated failed attempts.'
        close-from: |-
            [AI] The `sudo --close-from` command is a feature in the `sudo` (Short for Superuser DO) utility, used to manage user privileges in Linux and Unix-based systems. This option allows you to close a group of processes that were started under sudo with a single command.

            The syntax is `sudo --close-from <pid> [<&] [<&-]]`, where `<pid>` represents the process ID of the first process in the group. By specifying the process ID, all processes with a higher process group ID will be closed. This can be useful for terminating related or dependent processes gracefully without having to individually identify each one.

            For example, if you have multiple processes running under `sudo` and want to close them all at once, you could find the process ID of the first process in the group using 'pgrep' or 'ps', and then run:

            ```bash
            sudo --close-from <process_id>
            ```

            Keep in mind that terminating processes forcefully might result in data loss or unexpected behavior, so it is recommended to use this command carefully.
        edit: '[AI] `sudo --edit` is a command used in Linux and Unix-based systems to open the default text editor with superuser (root) privileges for editing files that normally require elevated access. It''s part of the sudo package, which allows users to run programs with the security privileges of another user (by default, the root user). By using `--edit` option, you can edit configuration files and make necessary changes without having to enter passwords repeatedly for each file save. This can be especially useful when performing multiple edits on different files that require superuser access.'
        group: '[AI] The `sudo --group` command is not a valid flag for the `sudo` (Short for Superuser DO) utility in Unix-like operating systems. The `sudo` command is used to execute commands with the security privileges of another user (by default, the superuser). It supports various options and flags, but there''s no option or flag called `--group`. If you meant to ask about managing sudo groups or users, use the `visudo` command to edit the sudoers file, which defines who can run what commands using sudo.'
        help: '[AI] `sudo --help` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to display help information about the sudo (Superuser DO) utility. This utility allows users to execute commands with root or superuser privileges. The `--help` option displays detailed usage instructions, options, and their meanings for the sudo command. It is commonly used when a user needs a quick reference on how to use sudo effectively and securely.'
        host: |-
            [AI] The `sudo --host` command is not a valid flag or option for the `sudo` (Short for Superuser DO) utility in Linux and Unix-based systems. The `sudo` command allows users to execute commands with root (administrative) privileges. It normally requires the user to provide the password of the root account or an administrator's account.

            The `--host` flag is not recognized by the sudo utility, and there's no such option in the standard sudo configuration. If you encounter this command, it might be a typo or a mistake. Please check the documentation or man pages of your specific sudo implementation for valid flags and options.
        list: '[AI] `sudo --list` is a command used with the Sudo (Short for Superuser DO) package, which allows users to execute commands with the security privileges of another user (typically the superuser). This command displays a list of currently configured sudoers, their assigned privileges, and the associated host or runas specification. It does not require administrative credentials to be run but only shows the configuration, not executing any commands.'
        login: '[AI] `sudo --login` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems to open a new shell session with elevated privileges. When you type this command followed by your password, it starts the login process for the root user or another user with sudo privileges. This allows you to run administrative tasks and commands that require higher access levels than your regular user account. Once logged in as the superuser, you can perform system-level operations until you log out.'
        non-interactive: '[AI] `sudo --non-interactive` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems to run programs with superuser (root) privileges without being prompted for a password or user confirmation. The `--non-interactive` flag suppresses the interactive prompts that usually appear when using `sudo`. It''s often used in scripts and automated tasks where you want to execute commands with elevated privileges without requiring manual intervention at the command line.'
        other-user: '[AI] `sudo --other-user` is a command used in Unix and Linux systems to run a command as a different user than the current one. The `--other-user` option allows specifying the desired user account with which to execute the command. This can be useful for performing administrative tasks or accessing resources owned by another user while maintaining the security of the system. For example, `sudo -u john script.sh` runs the `script.sh` command as the user `john`. Always ensure proper authorization and security measures are in place when using `sudo --other-user`.'
        preserve-env: '[AI] The `sudo --preserve-env` command is a modification of the `sudo` (Short for "Superuser Do") utility that allows keeping the current environment variables when running a command with superuser privileges. In regular use, `sudo` might drop some environment variables, so `--preserve-env` is used to preserve them and make sure they''re available during the execution of the superuser command.'
        preserve-groups: '[AI] `sudo --preserve-groups` is a command-line option used with the `sudo` (Short for Superuser DO) utility in Unix-like operating systems. This option prevents the primary group of the user being stopped when they gain superuser privileges. In other words, it allows the user to maintain their original group memberships when running commands as the root user or another user with sudo privileges. This can be useful when working with software packages or configuration files that require specific group permissions.'
        prompt: '[AI] `sudo --prompt` is a feature in the `sudo` (Short for Superuser DO) utility that allows customizing the prompt message displayed when a user runs a command with superuser privileges using `sudo`. It helps in identifying the user and command that is being executed with elevated permissions. The default prompt is typically something like `[sudo] password:`, but you can set it to any desired format using this option, such as `User@Host$`. For example, `sudo --prompt=''%s @ %h %b>''` would display `username@host:/path/to/command>`.'
        remove-timestamp: '[AI] The `sudo --remove-timestamp` command is a feature of sudo, which is a utility for executing commands with the security privileges of another user (often the superuser). This specific command option is used to prevent the modification timestamps of the files or directories that are being accessed from being updated when a sudo command is run. By using `sudo --remove-timestamp`, the timestamps will not be touched during the execution of the command, helping to maintain the consistency of file metadata in certain use cases where modifications should not affect the timestamps.'
        reset-timestamp: '[AI] The `sudo --reset-timestamp` command is a utility for the SUDO (Simple User DO) access control system. It''s used to reset the timestamp of the sudoers file, which stores the permissions for users to execute privileged commands. This action can be helpful in certain situations like after changing the system clock or when you want to reapply previously revoked sudo access. The command doesn''t affect the actual execution of privileged commands; it just updates the timestamp of the sudoers file, making the changes take effect again.'
        set-home: '[AI] `sudo --set-home` is a command used with the Sudo (Short for Superuser DO) utility in Linux and other Unix-like systems. This command modifies the default home directory that is used when a user runs a Sudo command as another user. By setting the home directory using this option, you can customize the environment for the privileged command execution without requiring the target user to have their password. It''s important to note that this change applies only to the current invocation of sudo and not permanently.'
        shell: '[AI] The `sudo` command with the `--shell` option allows a user to open a new shell session with elevated privileges. When used, `sudo` grants temporary root access to the specified user, allowing them to run commands as if they were the superuser. The `--shell` argument causes `sudo` to start a new shell instance instead of just executing the given command. This can be useful when performing complex tasks that require extended privileges over multiple commands. Keep in mind that misusing this feature can lead to security vulnerabilities, so it should only be used responsibly and by trusted users.'
        stdin: '[AI] `sudo --stdin` is a command-line option used with the `sudo` (short for "superuser do") utility in Unix and Linux systems. It allows users to run commands or programs as the superuser or another user, passing their input through a secure pipe instead of an interactive terminal. This can be useful when automating tasks requiring elevated privileges, especially in scripts where the password must not be stored in plaintext. The `--stdin` option instructs sudo to read input from standard input (stdin) rather than asking for it on the console.'
        user: '[AI] The `sudo --user` command is used to specify which user should be used when running a `sudo` command. It allows you to run a command with superuser (root) privileges but under a different user account. For example, `sudo --user john mycommand` will run the command `mycommand` as user "john" with root permissions. This can be useful for administrative tasks that need to be performed as a specific user instead of the root user directly.'
        validate: '[AI] `sudo --validate` is a command used in the sudo package to check the validity of sudoers file format and access rules without actually executing any commands. It performs syntactical analysis and checks for errors or inconsistencies, helping to maintain proper security configurations.'
        version: '[AI] `sudo --version` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems to display version information about the sudo (Superuser DO) utility. When executed, it prints out the name of the sudo package, its version number, and compilation options if available. This information helps users determine if their system has the latest version of sudo installed and if any updates are necessary.'
