documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tsh apps logout` command is used in the Terminal Access Controller (TAC) Shell (tsh) provided by Tripwire''s Tenable Security Center to log out of all active applications under a specific user session. This command does not directly terminate the terminal session itself but ends the connection between the Tsh client and the applications running on the remote system, helping maintain security by disconnecting potentially unattended or unsecured applications.'
