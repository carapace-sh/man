flags:
    --disable-content-trust: Skip image verification

    -a, --all-tags: Download all tagged images in the repository
    -q, --quiet: Suppress verbose output
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker image pull` is a command used in Docker to retrieve an image from a registry, such as Docker Hub or Google Container Registry. The command takes one or more image names as arguments and pulls the corresponding image and its associated metadata from the registry, saving it locally in the Docker image repository for later use in container creation.'
    flag:
        all-tags: '[AI] The `docker image pull --all-tags` command is used to retrieve all available versions or tags of a Docker image from a registry. When you run this command followed by the name of an image, Docker will attempt to pull down every tag associated with that image. For instance, if there are tags such as v1.0.0, v1.1.0, and latest, running `docker image pull --all-tags myimage` would download all these versions. This command is useful when you want to ensure that your local Docker environment has the most up-to-date images.'
        disable-content-trust: |-
            [AI] The `docker image pull --disable-content-trust` command is used to download a Docker image from a registry without verifying its content signatures. This means that the images are assumed to be trustworthy and not tampered with during transfer, but it bypasses Docker's built-in security feature that checks image authenticity upon pull.

            This option is often used when working with private registries where trusted relationships have already been established or when dealing with legacy images without signatures. It should be noted that using this command can pose a risk if the images are maliciously modified, as Docker won't raise any warnings about potential security threats.
        platform: '[AI] The `docker image pull --platform` command is used to pull a Docker image with specific platform requirements. The `--platform` flag filters the image registry for platforms that match the given triple: <architecture>-<os>-<version>. For example, `x86_64-linux-gnu` or `armv7l-windows`. This command helps ensure that the pulled image is compatible with the target platform and architecture. It''s essential in containerized applications for avoiding potential runtime issues due to architecture or OS incompatibilities.'
        quiet: '[AI] `docker image pull --quiet` is a command used to pull a Docker image from a registry, but with the added flag `--quiet`, it will suppress all output except for error messages and the image tag and digest once it has been pulled successfully. This can be useful in automated scripts or continuous integration workflows where you don''t need to see the progress bar or other informational messages.'
