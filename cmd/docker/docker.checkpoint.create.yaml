name: create [OPTIONS] CONTAINER CHECKPOINT
description: Create a checkpoint from a running container
flags:
    --checkpoint-dir=: Use a custom checkpoint storage directory
    --leave-running: Leave the container running after checkpoint
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker checkpoint create` command is used to create a checkpoint of a running container''s process and network state. Checkpoints can be used for various purposes such as saving the state of a container for backup or migration, or for creating a snapshot that can be used to quickly restart a container from a specific point in time. The command takes the name of the container as an argument and creates a new checkpoint file with a unique name in the default checkpoint storage driver (overlay2 by default).'
    flag:
        checkpoint-dir: '[AI] The `docker checkpoint create` command is used to create a checkpoint of a running container''s process and state. The `--checkpoint-dir` option specifies the directory where the created checkpoint files will be stored. Checkpoints allow for saving and restoring the state of a container, which can be useful for things like container migration or disaster recovery. When you create a checkpoint, Docker writes the necessary metadata and snapshot data to the specified directory. The resulting files can then be transferred to another system for use in creating a new container with the same state.'
        leave-running: '[AI] The `docker checkpoint create --leave-running` command creates a checkpoint of a running container''s process and network state without stopping it. This allows you to save the container''s current state for later restoration, while keeping the container running. The `--leave-running` flag ensures that the container continues to run after the checkpoint is created.'
