    command: '[AI] "gnome-maps" is a command-line tool for accessing and searching for locations using the GNOME Maps application in the GNOME desktop environment. It allows users to perform map queries, get directions, and save locations from the terminal.

    flag:
        display: '[AI] `gnome-maps --display` is a command used in the GNOME desktop environment to launch the Gnome Maps application with the X11 `--display` option. The `--display` option specifies the display server where the graphical user interface should be rendered, allowing the application to run on a different display or session than the one initiating the command.'
        force-online: '[AI] `gnome-maps --force-online` is a command-line option for the GNOME Maps application. It forces the tool to use online maps data instead of cached or offline maps. This can be useful when the user wants to ensure they have access to the most up-to-date map information, even if it requires an internet connection.'
        help: '[AI] `gnome-maps --help` is a command in the GNOME desktop environment used to display and interact with map data. When you run this command with the `--help` option, it will show you a brief explanation of how to use the gnome-maps application. The output includes information on how to open the application, search for locations using keywords or coordinates, perform various map interactions such as zooming and panning, and obtain directions between two points. Additionally, it mentions supported map sources like OpenStreetMap, and other useful features such as adding markers and customizing the appearance of the map.'
        help-all: '[AI] `gnome-maps --help-all` is a command in GNOME Maps, a mapping application for GNOME desktop environment. This command displays an extensive help text that covers all available options and their descriptions for the `gnome-maps` executable. By providing the `--help-all` flag, users can get a comprehensive overview of how to use this tool effectively.'
        help-gapplication: '[AI] The command `gnome-maps --help-gapplication` is used to display help information specifically related to the GApplication interface of the Gnome Maps application. This command provides details on how to use and interact with Gnome Maps as a GTK+ application, including its main functions, signals, properties, and methods. It''s meant for developers who want to integrate or extend the functionality of Gnome Maps in their own projects using the GApplication API.'
        help-gtk: '[AI] `gnome-maps --help-gtk` is a command related to Gnome Maps, a mapping application from the GNOME desktop environment. The `--help-gtk` option is specifically for displaying GTK+ related help information. GTK+ is a popular graphical user interface toolkit used in developing applications for the GNOME desktop. By running this command, you will receive detailed information about how to use the GTK+ components of Gnome Maps effectively.'
        local: '[AI] `gnome-maps --local` is a command in the GNOME desktop environment used to open the Maps application with the local data only, without connecting to any online services. The `--local` option instructs the application to use only offline maps and location data stored on the user''s computer. This can be useful for users who want to conserve internet bandwidth or maintain privacy by not sharing their location information online.'
        local-tile-size: '[AI] The `gnome-maps --local-tile-size` is a command-line option for the GNOME Maps application. It sets the size of locally cached map tiles in pixels. A smaller tile size results in faster rendering at the expense of lower image quality, while a larger tile size provides better image quality but requires more resources and longer loading times. The default value is typically 256x256 pixels.'
        version: '[AI] `gnome-maps --version` is a command used in the terminal or command line interface (CLI) to check the current version of Gnome Maps, a mapping application component of the Gnome desktop environment. The `--version` option requests that the command prints out the version number and build information associated with the installed instance of Gnome Maps. This can be helpful for users to ensure they have the latest updates or to troubleshoot compatibility issues with other software.'
