        [AI] The `git sh-i18n` command is not a standard Git command. It seems to be a custom script specific to the Git for Windows project, used for updating Gettext translation files. It stands for "Git shell i18n," which means "internationalization" in the Git shell environment.

        This script automates the process of generating and updating PO (Portable Object) and MO (Machine Object) files, which are essential for translating Git messages and error messages into various languages using Gettext tools like xgettext and msgfmt. This command is helpful for maintaining multilingual support in Git projects.
