documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pkg search` command is used in pkgsrc, the package management system for the NetBSD and some other Unix-like operating systems. It searches the pkg-descriptions database for packages that match a given keyword or regular expression and returns their names and short descriptions. For example, `pkg search -a firefox` would list all packages whose descriptions contain the word "firefox".'
