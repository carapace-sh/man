    command: '[AI] The `tmux` command `previous-layout` allows you to cycle through your saved layouts in the order they were created, going back one at a time. This can be useful when you have multiple session configurations and want to quickly switch between them. It does not affect the currently running sessions or their contents; it only changes the layout of the session manager window.'
    flag:
