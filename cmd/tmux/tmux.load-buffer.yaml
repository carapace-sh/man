documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux load-buffer` command in TMUX is used to load the contents of a file into an active pane''s buffer. When you run this command followed by the path to a file, TMUX reads the file and replaces the current buffer with its content, effectively treating the file as if it had been opened in a new terminal session within the TMUX environment.'
    flag:
        b: '[AI] `tmux load-buffer` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. The `-b` option specifies that the buffer to be loaded is stored in a named session or window instead of a regular file. For example, `tmux load-buffer -b my-session:my-window` would load the contents of `my-window` from the session named `my-session`. This command can be useful when you want to restore the state of a specific window or session that was saved earlier.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux load-buffer` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer, used to load the contents of a file or a buffer into an attached pane. The `-t` option specifies the target window or pane identifier to which the loaded content should be written. So, `tmux load-buffer -t <ID> <file>` loads the contents of `<file>` into the pane or window with the given identifier `<ID>`.'
