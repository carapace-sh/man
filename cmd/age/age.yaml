documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `age` command is not a standard Unix or Linux command, as it does not exist in their core utilities. It might refer to specific commands used in certain applications or scripts to calculate the difference between two dates or the age of a file based on its modification time. For example, in Perl there''s an `age` script that can display the elapsed time since a file was last modified. Always check the documentation for the specific usage and context when encountering a command called "age".'
    flag:
        armor: '[AI] The `--armor` option is used with the `age` command in Unix-based systems, which is a tool for human-readable output of file age information. The `--armor` option modifies the output format to include headers and trailer lines that make it easier to parse or compare the output using tools like `diff`. These headers and trailers contain timestamps and other metadata in a format compatible with OpenPGP armored messages, hence the name "armor" format. The primary purpose of this option is for comparison or automated processing of the output instead of just displaying it to human users.'
        decrypt: '[AI] The `age` command is a Linux tool used to display the age of files or directories, showing when each file was last modified, accessed, or changed. The `--decrypt` option is not a valid flag for this command. The correct way to view encrypted files using the `age` command would be to decrypt them first before checking their ages.'
        encrypt: '[AI] `age --encrypt` is a command used in the Age file manager for macOS to encrypt files or directories using the FileVault 2 full disk encryption feature built into macOS. When run with this argument, Age will prompt you to authenticate with your system account password before encrypting the selected items. The encrypted data is then protected by the user''s login keychain and can only be accessed when logged in on that specific machine or when using Apple''s FileVault-enabled tools like `fsck_apa` or `diskutil`.'
        identity: '[AI] The `--identity` option is a parameter used with the `age` command in Unix-like operating systems, particularly in the Git version control system. It specifies that the output of the `age` command should display the identity (username and email address) associated with each commit instead of just the age or timestamps. This can be helpful for understanding who made a particular commit and when it was done.'
        output: '[AI] The `--output` option in the `age` command is used to specify an output file for the result of the command. The `age` command calculates file age statistics, such as last modification time or access time, and writes the output to the specified file instead of printing it to the console.'
        passphrase: '[AI] The `--passphrase` option in GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard) is used when working with symmetric encryption keys. A passphrase is a secret, user-defined text or phrase that must be entered to access and use the encrypted data or key. The `age` command in GnuPG is a tool for displaying the age of keys. When using the `age` command with the `--passphrase` option, it prompts for the passphrase before checking the validity and expiration date of the symmetric encryption key. This adds an extra layer of security to ensure only authorized users can access the sensitive information.'
        recipient: '[AI] The `--recipient` flag in the `age` command in Git is used to specify the commit or author whose age statistics should be displayed. For example, `age --recipient=authorname` will show the age statistics for commits authored by "authorname". This can help identify stale branches or outdated code.'
        recipients-file: '[AI] The `--recipients-file` option under the `age` command in Linux is used to read email recipient addresses from a file instead of specifying them on the command line. The file should contain one address per line for proper functioning. This can be useful when dealing with large numbers of emails or recipients, as it avoids having to manually enter each address individually.'
