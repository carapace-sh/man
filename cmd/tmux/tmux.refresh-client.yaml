documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux refresh-client` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to update a connected client about the current state of a session. When you make changes to a TMUX session, such as creating or deleting windows or panes, those modifications are not immediately reflected for clients that are attached to that session but are not currently active. The `refresh-client` command can be run from within a session or from the terminal outside of it to synchronize the state of the session with all connected clients, ensuring they have the latest information about the layout and content of the session.'
    flag:
        A: '[AI] The `tmux refresh-client -A` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to force all attached clients to update their panes with the latest data from the server. The "-A" flag stands for "all", indicating that this command applies to all connected clients. By executing this command, any changes made on the server-side, such as window resizing or new output in a pane, will be propagated to all clients.'
        B: '[AI] `tmux refresh-client` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to update the client sessions with the latest changes made to the server session. The `-B` flag stands for "background" mode, which means that the command will run in the background after being executed, allowing the user to continue working in the terminal without waiting for the refresh process to finish.'
        C: '[AI] `tmux refresh-client` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer, used to update a client session with changes made on the server side. The `-C` option (short for "sync-panes") ensures that the client''s panes are resized and synchronized with the layout of the server session.'
        D: '[AI] `tmux refresh-client -D` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to forcibly redraw the client terminal window. The `-D` option stands for "detach and redraw," meaning that the command not only updates the display but also detaches any attached sessions if they''re currently in the background, ensuring the terminal view reflects the most recent state of the Tmux session.'
        L: '[AI] `tmux refresh-client -L` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer environment. It instructs tmux to send a refresh signal to the client (terminal or application), requesting it to redraw the terminal window with updated data from the server session. The `-L` flag stands for "local mode," indicating that the refresh is initiated from the local client side and not the server.'
        R: |-
            [AI] `tmux refresh-client -R` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to synchronize the local and remote sessions. The "-R" option stands for "remote-silent", which means that the command will not output any messages when refreshing the client.

            When you run `refresh-client -R`, tmux fetches the most recent state of all the attached server sessions and applies the changes to the local client in real time. This ensures that your local terminal window displays the same information as the remote session, keeping them in sync.

            This is particularly useful when working remotely on a distributed team, or when you have multiple terminal windows open on different machines but want to keep the same sessions active across them.
        S: '[AI] The `tmux refresh-client` command with the `-S` option is used to refresh the tmux server session information on a client, i.e., a terminal or a window where a tmux session is attached. This can be useful when changes have been made to the session from another client, and you want to update your local view of the session. The `-S` flag specifies that you want to connect to the server using the socket file instead of the default server location.'
        U: '[AI] `tmux refresh-client -U` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer software. It''s used to synchronize the local terminal session with a remote server, updating the display of the client to match the current state of the server''s session. The "-U" option stands for "unsynchronized", meaning that the command will refresh the client even if it is already in sync with the server. This can be useful when changes have been made to the server-side session but have not yet been reflected on the local client.'
        c: '[AI] `tmux refresh-client` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to synchronize client sessions with the server. The `-c` option stands for "detach on succeed," which means that after the refresh, the local session will be detached from the server if the synchronization was successful. This can be useful when managing multiple sessions across different terminals or sessions, ensuring that they are all up-to-date with the latest changes.'
        f: '[AI] `tmux refresh-client -f` is a command used in the tmux terminal multiplexer to forcibly update a connected client session with the latest changes made to the server session. The `-f` option forces the refresh even if there are no differences between the client and server sessions, ensuring that both remain in sync.'
        l: '[AI] The `tmux refresh-client -l` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to forcibly redraw the terminal screen of a connected client. The "-l" flag stands for "local", which means the command will be executed on the local machine running tmux, causing it to send a update signal to all attached clients, instructing them to redraw their screens with the latest session information.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux refresh-client` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to update the client terminal with the latest changes made in the server session. The `-t` option specifies the target session or window title to refresh. So, `tmux refresh-client -t "session_name"` will update the client terminal with the changes in the specified Tmux session named "session\_name".'
