    command: '[AI] `adb reconnect` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB), a versatile tool that allows communication between a computer and an Android device. This command enables you to change the connection method or IP address of an already connected Android device. For instance, if your device''s network connection changes while ADB is active, running `adb reconnect <new_ip_address>:<port>` will update the ADB connection accordingly. This ensures seamless communication between your computer and your Android device despite connectivity changes.'
