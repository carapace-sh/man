    command: '[AI] The `adb get-state` command is used with Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to query the current state of devices connected via ADB. It returns information about the state of each connected device, including its serial number, state (online or offline), and whether it is a device or an emulator. This can be helpful in identifying and managing multiple connected devices during development or system administration tasks.'
