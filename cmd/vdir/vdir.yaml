documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vdir` is a command used in the Mercurial version control system to list the available named branches or directories (referred to as "volages" in Mercurial) under the current repository. It displays each volage''s name and the commit hash of its tip, helping users navigate and manage their branching structure.'
    flag:
        "1": |-
            [AI] The `vdir -1` command is not a standard flag or command in Unix-like operating systems or in version control systems like Git. It seems to be specific to a version control system called VCS (Versi√≥n Control System), which is primarily used in the Spanish-speaking world.

            The `vdir -1` command is used with the `vcs` command-line interface and it is used to list the files in the working directory that have local modifications or are not tracked by the VCS system. The `-1` option makes the output more compact, displaying only the names of the files without any additional information like author or commit message.
        C: '[AI] `vdir -C` is a command in Vim''s file explorer plugin, `vim-plug`, used to change the current directory (cd) in the explorer window. The `vdir` command opens or focuses on the explorer window, and the `-C` flag appends the new directory path to the current one when changing directories. For example, if the current directory is `/home/user`, and you want to change to `/home/user/Documents`, you would use `:VExplore /home/user/Documents --split <CR> :cd %` followed by `:VDir -C Documents`. This sequence opens a split window with the explorer, changes to the new directory and updates the Vim buffer accordingly.'
        S: '[AI] `vdir -S` is a command used in the Vim file explorer plugin for Vim text editor. The `-S` option stands for "split" and causes the file explorer to open in a split window instead of a new tab or pop-up window. When you run `:VExplore` followed by `:h vdir` to explore files with this option, both the file explorer and the original editing window remain visible on the screen. This can be useful for keeping your file navigation and editing in one view while working.'
        U: '[AI] `vdir -U` is a command in Vim''s file explorer plugin, Nvim-Tree. The `-U` flag stands for "up" and is used to navigate up one directory level when using Nvim-Tree. When you run `:NvimTreeOpen` followed by `vdir -U`, it will open the parent directory of your current location in the file explorer.'
        X: |-
            [AI] The `vdir -X` command is not a standard flag or command in Unix or Linux file systems. It seems to be specific to the `vdir`, a virtual directory tool for Go language.

            The `-X` flag is used with `vdir` to enable cross-origin request sharing (CORS) support. CORS is a security measure that allows web applications running on one origin to make requests to servers running on another origin, under certain conditions. Enabling this flag will allow the served files to be accessible from different origins with specified headers allowing or denying access.
        all: '[AI] `vdir --all` is a command in the Vim file explorer plugin for Vim text editor. This command, when used with the `:Explore` or `:E` command to open the file explorer window, will display all directories and hidden files in the current project or the root directory, depending on the configuration of the plugin. It''s equivalent to using the `--depth 0` and `--hidden` flags together.'
        almost-all: '[AI] `vdir --almost-all` is a command in Vim''s file explorer plugin, `vim-filer-navigator`. It functions similarly to the Unix command `ls -R --all`, displaying the contents of all subdirectories recursively. However, unlike `--all`, which shows hidden files and directories as well, `--almost-all` only shows non-hidden regular files and directories in the subdirectories. This can be useful when you want to explore the directory structure while excluding certain types of files or directories from view.'
        author: '[AI] `vdir --author` is a command in the V Dir (Version Directory) file manager for Git. It displays the author information of the committed files or directories in a repository. The option `--author` is used to limit the output to only show the commit author name and email address. This can be helpful when reviewing commits and identifying who made specific changes in a project.'
        block-size: |-
            [AI] `vdir --block-size` is a command-line option for the virtual directory (vdir) tool in Nextcloud, an open-source file hosting platform. This option sets the block size for reading and writing data. A larger block size can improve performance by reducing the number of read/write operations, but it also requires more memory. The default value is typically 4KB (4096 bytes). To use this option, include it when invoking the vdir tool with the `find`, `ls`, or other supported commands:

            ```bash
            vdir find /path/to/nextcloud --block-size 16KB
            ```
        c: '[AI] `vdir -c` is a command in Vim''s file explorer plugin, `vexplorermkdp`, which stands for "create". When you run `vdir -c` followed by pressing Enter, it creates a new directory at the current location of the Vim window. This command is typically used when you want to create a new folder in your file system while using the `vexplorer` plugin within Vim.'
        classify: '[AI] `vdir --classify` is a command used in the Vdir file explorer application, which is designed for handling large volumes of data. The `--classify` option instructs Vdir to apply predefined rules or filters to classify and label files based on specific attributes like file type, size, or date. This can help with organizing and managing files more efficiently by automatically sorting them into categories.'
        color: '[AI] `vdir --color` is a command-line option used with the vim-style file explorer, `vdirstatus`. This option enables colored output when using `vdirstatus` to inspect the status of directories and files under Git version control. With `--color`, the output will be enhanced with different colors for untracked files, modified files, deleted files, and other status indicators, making it easier to identify the file states at a glance.'
        context: '[AI] `vdir --context` is a command used in the `rclone` tool for managing remote file storage. The `vdir` subcommand lists the contents of a remote directory. The `--context` option is used to filter the output, showing only directories or files that match a given context. This context can be defined using regular expressions. By using `--context`, you can easily navigate and manage large volumes of data stored in remote directories.'
        dereference: '[AI] `vdir --dereference` is a command-line option used with the `vdir` tool in Git, specifically for the `git ls-tree` and `git fsck` commands. It instructs these commands to follow symbolic links and traverse directories recursively when listing tree contents or checking file system integrity, respectively. This allows these commands to accurately represent the actual contents of a repository, rather than just their representation in the filesystem.'
        dereference-command-line: |-
            [AI] The `vdir --dereference-command-line` flag is used with the `vdir` command in Git, which is a virtual directory tool for showing the files in multiple Git repositories as if they were in one single directory.

            This specific flag tells `vdir` to apply the given dereference command to each path on the command line before resolving it against the Git repositories. This can be useful when dealing with symbolic links or other special files that need to be handled by a custom script before being displayed in the virtual directory.

            For example, if you have a symlink `mylink` pointing to a file `foo.txt` in repository A, and you want to see the contents of `foo.txt` when using `vdir`, you can use the following command:

            ```bash
            vdir --dereference-command="ln -sf {path} /tmp/ && cat /tmp/{linkname}" path/to/mylink
            ```

            Here, the `--dereference-command` flag is used to execute a `ln -sf` command that follows the symbolic link and then uses the `cat` command to display the contents of the file at the target location.
        dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir: '[AI] The `vdir --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir` flag is a command-line option for the `vdir` sync tool in Nextcloud. It instructs `vdir` to follow symlinks specified on the command line that point to directories, instead of treating them as regular files during the synchronization process. This allows `vdir` to correctly handle and update the content of the linked directories.'
        directory: |-
            [AI] `vdir --directory` is a command used in Vim, a popular text editor, to navigate and manage directories from within the editor. The `--directory` argument is optional and it specifies that you want to work with directories instead of files.

            The `vdir` command allows you to browse your file system in a split window in Vim, displaying the directory structure as a tree. With the `--directory` option, you can easily move between different directories without leaving the editor. It's especially useful when working on projects that involve multiple files spread across various directories.
        dired: |-
            [AI] `vdir` is a Vim plugin that provides an explorative file manager interface within the Vim text editor. The command `:Vex` or `:Vexplore` is used to open it.

            The flag `--dired` stands for "directory list" and is used with the `vdir` plugin. When this flag is set, `vdir` opens in the "diff mode," which displays a split window showing the directory contents as well as the file being edited. This can be useful when you want to navigate files and edit them in place without leaving the Vim editor.
        escape: '[AI] `vdir --escape` is a command in the Vim file explorer plugin for Vim text editor. The `--escape` flag is used to escape special characters in file and directory names during the file selection process. With this flag, special characters like `*`, `?`, `[]`, `\`, and `{ } |` in the input are treated as literal characters instead of having any special meaning, allowing users to navigate to files or directories with unusual or complex names more easily.'
        f: '[AI] `vdir -f` is a command in the Vim file explorer plugin for Vim text editor. The `-f` option stands for "follow symbolsic links." When used, this option enables Vim to traverse and open directories that contain symbolic links (symlinks), displaying the content of the linked directory instead of the symlink itself.'
        file-type: '[AI] The `vdir --file-type` option in Vim is used to display the file type or icon of each file in a list or tree view created by the `:Vexplore` or `:Explore` commands. It automatically sets the file type based on the file extension and adjusts syntax highlighting, indentation, and other features accordingly for the best editing experience. This helps users quickly identify and navigate between different types of files in their projects.'
        format: '[AI] `vdir --format` is a command-line option used with the Vdir file explorer tool in the Rust programming language. It specifies the format of the output when listing files and directories. For example, `--format="{:name}{:'' ''}-{:size}B"`, would display each file with its name followed by a space and then the size in bytes. Other formats can be used to display different information such as last modified date or permissions.'
        full-time: '[AI] `vdir --full-time` is a command in Vim''s file explorer plugin, `vim-filer-nvim`. The option `--full-time` causes the file explorer window to be opened in full-screen mode when it is displayed. This can help users focus on browsing files and directories without other distractions in the Vim editor.'
        g: '[AI] The `vdir -g` command is a VDSM (Virtual Data Center Manager) command used in Red Hat Virtualization. The `-g` option stands for "group." This command lists the members of a specified group within the context of a virtual data center. With `vdir`, you can manage various virtual resources, and using it with the `-g` option helps you manage groups specifically.'
        group-directories-first: '[AI] The `vdir` command is a tool from the Vifm file manager for interacting with directories over the Vim text editor. The option `--group-directories-first` is used to change the default behavior of listing directories in a separate group at the top of the file and subdirectory list. With this option, grouped directories will be displayed first in the output instead. This can be useful for navigating through directory structures with many levels or when dealing with deep hierarchies where keeping track of the current location is important.'
        help: '[AI] `vdir --help` is a command used in Vim''s file explorer plugin, Nvim-Tree or Netrw. It displays help information about the `vdir` (Vim directory) command. This command allows navigating and operating on directories in a split window within Vim or Neovim. The help message provides detailed information on usage, options, and keys for this command.'
        hide: '[AI] The `vdir --hide` command is a subcommand under Version Dirstatus (vdir), which is a popular Git visualization tool. This command is used to hide or exclude specific files, directories, or patterns from the output of vdir. When you run `vdir --hide PATTERN`, it will suppress the display of matched files or directories in the output. For example, running `vdir --hide "*.log"` would hide all files with a ".log" extension from the displayed Git diffs and commits.'
        hide-control-chars: '[AI] The `vdir --hide-control-chars` command is used with the Vim file explorer (vdir) in Vim or Neovim text editors. This option hides control characters in the file and directory listings, making the output cleaner and easier to read by displaying only printable characters. It helps to improve the readability of the output when navigating directories with vdir.'
        human-readable: '[AI] `vdir --human-readable` is a command-line option used with the Vdir file manager in Go. This option, when set, instructs Vdir to display directory and file sizes in a human-readable format (i.e., with units of KB, MB, GB, etc.) alongside filenames when listing directories, making it easier for users to understand the size implications of each file or directory.'
        hyperlink: |-
            [AI] The `vdir --hyperlink` command in Vim is used to create or manage symbolic links (also called "hard links" in some contexts, but Vim specifically refers to them as "symbolic links" or "hyperlinks") in a directory listing.

            When you're navigating through directories with Vim using the `:cd` command or other means and encounter a symbolic link, it might be displayed with its linked-to path instead of the local path. With `vdir --hyperlink`, you can manipulate these links directly from the Vim interface.

            The main actions provided by this command are:

            1. Creating a new hyperlink: Use `:HyNewLink <source> <target>` to create a new symbolic link from `<source>` to `<target>`.
            2. Deleting an existing hyperlink: Use `:HyDelete <hyperlink>` to delete the symbolic link at the specified path.
            3. Following a hyperlink: Use `:e ++h <path>` or `:edit ++h <path>` to open the file or directory that is being linked to by the given path. Note that this doesn't change the current working directory, it just opens the file in a new window.
            4. Listing all hyperlinks in the current directory: Use `:HyList` to display a list of all symbolic links in the current directory, along with their target paths.
        ignore: '[AI] `vdir --ignore` is a command in the Vistools library for Versioning and Data Management systems, specifically for the vdir tool which is used to interactively manage versioned directories. The `--ignore` option allows users to specify files or directories that should be ignored when synchronizing changes between local and remote versions of a directory. This can be useful for excluding large or unnecessary files from being transferred repeatedly, thus improving performance and reducing network traffic. The ignore list is typically specified as a pattern in a file called `.vdirignore` in the root directory of the versioned directory.'
        ignore-backups: |-
            [AI] The `vdir --ignore-backups` command is a flag used with the Version Distributed Interactively (VDI) tool, specifically for the `vdir` command which is used to synchronize directories between multiple locations.

            This flag instructs VDI to ignore files or directories with backup suffixes (e.g., `*.bak`, `*.backup`, `.*~`) when performing the directory comparison and synchronization process. This can help exclude unnecessary backup files from being transferred or updated unintentionally during the synchronization, thereby saving bandwidth and reducing the chances of data corruption or version conflicts.
        indicator-style: |-
            [AI] `vdir --indicator-style` is a command-line option for the Vim-style file explorer plugin, `vdir`. This option sets the visual indicator style used to mark directories and files in the split window where the file exploration takes place.

            The available styles include:

            1. `none` (default): No visual indicator is shown.
            2. `symbolic`: Shows symbols representing directories and files. For example, a folder icon for directories and a file icon for regular files.
            3. `minimal`: Displays the first few characters of the filename or directory name in parentheses.
            4. `fullpath`: Display the full path of the directory or file in the split window.

            These styles help users quickly differentiate between directories and files as they navigate through their file system using Vim and vdir.
        inode: '[AI] The `vdir --inode` command is a Vimm-style file explorer command used in the Vim text editor to navigate through directories using inode numbers instead of filenames or paths. The option `--inode` instructs Vim to switch to the directory containing the specified inode number. Inode numbers are unique identifiers assigned to files and directories by the file system, providing a way to directly access specific entries without relying on their names or locations in the directory hierarchy.'
        kibibytes: '[AI] The `vdir --kibibytes` command is a part of the Elasticsearch tool, called "vdir" which stands for "Version Difference Reporter". This command is used to report on the size differences between two Elasticsearch index snapshots or directories in Kibibytes (KB = 1024 bytes, MiB = 1024 KB, GiB = 1024 MiB). In simple terms, it provides a comparison of the disk usage between two versions of an Elasticsearch index and displays the difference in sizes in units of Kibibytes.'
        l: '[AI] `vdir -l` is a command used in the Vim file explorer plugin for viewing directory listings in Vim text editor. The `-l` option stands for "long listing format." With this option, the output displays file permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and last modification time for each file or directory in the listing.'
        literal: '[AI] The `vdir --literal` command is a subcommand under Version Difference (vdiff) tool in Git. It''s used to list the differences between two directories or paths as if they were files, displaying each file or directory entry as it appears literally. This means that the output shows the exact path structure and file names, rather than showing only the differences between the contents of the files. This can be useful when comparing directories with many files where the focus is on the structural difference, such as in a merge conflict resolution scenario.'
        m: '[AI] `vdir -m` is a command in VersionTree, a version control system for directories. The `-m` option specifies that the operation should be performed interactively in a textual menu interface. This allows users to select specific items or actions, making it useful when dealing with complex operations or large numbers of files. The `vdir` command itself is used to manage and navigate VersionTree repositories.'
        no-group: |-
            [AI] The `vdir --no-group` command is a Vim-specific one used in the context of the `vimdiff` tool for merging and comparing files.

            The `vdir` command is a Vim internal command that opens a new window displaying differences between two files. The `--no-group` flag is an optional argument to this command, which instructs Vim not to group hunks (i.e., logical blocks of changes) by their location in the source files but instead display each change individually, regardless of its origin. This can be useful when dealing with files that have substantial differences or when you want a more fine-grained comparison view.
        numeric-uid-gid: |-
            [AI] The `vdir` command with the option `--numeric-uid-gid` is used in the context of version control systems like Git or Mercurial. This option instructs the command to create directories and files with their owner and group set to the numeric UID (User ID) and GID (Group ID) instead of the default system user or group.

            This can be useful when dealing with large-scale deployments, where automation tools may require specific ownership of files and directories for optimal operation. By setting these permissions explicitly, you ensure that your automated processes run smoothly without needing to make manual adjustments later on.
        o: '[AI] The `vdir -o` command in Vim is used to create or open a new vertical directory window. The `vdir` is a plugin for Vim that displays a tree-like directory listing, and the option `-o` opens a new window for the directory display, splitting the screen vertically.'
        quote-name: '[AI] The `vdir --quote-name` option is used with the Vim file explorer (:`E` or `:Explore`) command in Vim text editor. When this option is set, Vim quotes special characters in the directory names when displaying them in the explorer window to prevent any special meaning of those characters. This ensures that the user intends to use these characters as part of a directory name and not for any other purpose.'
        quoting-style: |-
            [AI] `vdir --quoting-style` is a command-line option for the `rclone` tool's `vdir` command, which is used to list files and directories in a remote storage. The `--quoting-style` flag determines how special characters in file and directory names are quoted in the output.

            There are three available quoting styles: "none", "shell-escape", and "windows".

            1. "None": No special characters in filenames will be quoted or escaped in the output. This can result in unexpected behavior when using the output with other commands that might interpret the special characters as having special meaning.
            2. "Shell-escape": Special characters are escaped using backslashes (`\`) in the output. This is useful when working in a Unix shell, as it allows you to pass filenames with special characters as arguments to other commands without the need for further escaping.
            3. "Windows": Filenames containing special characters are quoted using double quotes ("") or backslashes () depending on the specific character. This quoting style is suitable when working in a Windows command prompt, as it follows the convention used by the Windows file system for handling filenames with special characters.
        recursive: '[AI] `vdir --recursive` is a command used in version control systems like Git, often within Bash scripts or terminal sessions. The `vdir` part refers to the `vdiff` or `vcsdiff` utility for displaying differences between directories or files under version control. The `--recursive` flag, when used with this command, instructs it to compare and show differences between all subdirectories and their contents recursively, not just the top-level directory. This can be useful for comprehending changes made across a larger project structure.'
        reverse: '[AI] `vdir --reverse` is a command in the Vim file explorer plugin for Vim text editor. The `--reverse` option reverses the sense of the filter or search used in the file exploration. By default, Vim searches for files that match the given pattern in the current directory and its subdirectories. With `--reverse`, it searches for files not matching the pattern. This can be useful when working with complex directory structures or multiple file extensions.'
        show-control-chars: '[AI] `vdir --show-control-chars` is a command option for the Vim file explorer (vdir) in Vim text editor. This option, when enabled, displays all control characters in the filename as they are stored in the file system. By default, Vim hides these invisible characters, making filenames appear cleaner. However, enabling this option can be helpful for debugging or understanding files with unusual or non-printable characters in their names.'
        si: '[AI] `vdir --si` is a command in the `vdirmc` (V Davis IRManager for version control) tool used to interact with the Mercurial Version Control System. The `--si` flag stands for "show size-and-age" format and is used to display the list of files or changesets along with their sizes and ages (last modification time). It helps users quickly identify large or recently modified items within a repository.'
        size: '[AI] The `vdir --size` command is a part of the Vdir CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for interacting with Vdir, a file system for versioned data. This specific command is used to retrieve the size information of files or directories within a Vdir repository. It returns the current size of the specified item in bytes, enabling users to easily monitor and manage their data usage.'
        sort: '[AI] `vdir --sort` is a command in the Vim file explorer plugin for Vim text editor. It sorts the files or directories in the current Vim session''s Vimplorer window by name, with options to sort in ascending or descending order using `--sort=asc` or `--sort=desc`, respectively. For instance, `:Vexplore --split right --silent --current-directory=$PWD | vdir --sort=asc`.'
