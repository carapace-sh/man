documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git remote add` is a Git command used to establish a new connection between your local repository and a remote repository, using a shortname of your choice. Syntax: `git remote add <shortname> <url>`. For instance, `git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>` sets up the default remote called ''origin''. This command doesn''t push or pull changes; it just sets up the connection for future interactions like fetching, pushing and cloning.'
    flag:
        fetch: '[AI] `git remote add` is a command used to establish a new connection or alias (a shorthand name) for an existing upstream repository in Git. The `--fetch` option fetches and updates the local repository with any new commits or changes from the newly added remote repository, bringing the local repository''s branches up-to-date with their corresponding remote branches without creating any new local branches.'

            [AI] `git remote add` is a Git command used to establish a new connection or alias for a remote repository with a specific name. The `--master` option is not a valid argument for this command; it seems like there's a typo in your question. Instead, you can use the following syntax:

            ```bash
            git remote add <new_remote_name> <remote_url>
            ```

            Replace `<new_remote_name>` with a descriptive name for the new remote repository and `<remote_url>` with the URL of the remote repository you want to connect to. This command adds the specified remote repository to your local Git configuration, allowing you to fetch or push changes between repositories using the given alias.
        mirror: '[AI] `git remote add --mirror <name> <url>` is a Git command used to set up a new remote repository as a mirrored fetch and push repository. A mirror remote fetches and pushes in both directions, meaning it synchronizes all local and remote branches. This is useful when you want to keep your local repository in sync with a remote repository that you have read-write access to. The `--mirror` flag instructs Git to create a mirror of the given remote URL, and sets up both fetch and push operations for it.'
        tags: '[AI] `git remote add` is a command used to establish a connection between your Git repository and a new remote repository, often on a different server. The `--tags` option specifically tells Git to also fetch and track any existing tags in the remote repository. This means that when you run `git fetch origin --tags`, for example, Git will not only update your local branches with the latest changes from the origin remote but also update your local tags with any new or changed tags on the origin server. This is useful if you want to work with multiple branches or collaborate with other developers using tagged releases.'
        track: '[AI] The `git remote add --track` command is used to create a new upstream remote repository in Git and set up tracking branches for each local branch. When you run this command followed by the remote name and URL, Git will establish a connection between your local repository and the remote one. The `--track` option enables automatic creation of tracking branches, meaning that each local branch will have a corresponding branch on the remote repository. This allows for seamless fetching and pushing of changes between the two repositories.'
