    command: '[AI] `goreleaser docs` is a command used with the Go Releaser tool, which simplifies the process of building, packaging, and releasing Go projects. This specific command generates or updates the documentation for the project using various supported document generators (like Godoc or Sphinx), and then packages it along with the binary during the release process. The generated documentation is typically bundled into the final package or made available as standalone HTML files.'
