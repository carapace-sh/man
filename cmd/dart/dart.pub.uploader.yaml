    command: '[AI] `dart pub uploader` is a command-line tool used in Dart programming language for publishing packages to the Dart Package Manager (pub.dev). It reads a local package directory, authenticates with the pub.dev platform using your `~/.dart/auth.json` file, and then uploads the specified package and its dependencies if they have valid version numbers and are listed in their respective `pubspec.yaml` files. The command line arguments can be used to specify various options such as a different authentication file or a specific version to publish. Once the package is published, it becomes accessible to other developers for use in their projects.'
