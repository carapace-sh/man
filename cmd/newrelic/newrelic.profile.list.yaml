    command: '[AI] The `newrelic profile list` command is used in New Relic''s command-line interface (CLI) to display a list of all Profiles, also known as Application Performance Monitoring (APM) profiles, currently available for your account.

            [AI] The `newrelic profile list --show-keys` command is a part of New Relic's Performance Monitoring tool for listing all available profiles, along with their unique API keys. This command provides essential information for managing and utilizing different application performance monitoring configurations efficiently.

            Here's a brief explanation:

            1. `newrelic`: This refers to the New Relic Command Line Interface (CLI) utility, which is used to manage various aspects of your application(s) and infrastructure monitored by New Relic.
            2. `profile list`: The `profile list` command lists all existing profiles registered with New Relic for a given account or application.
            3. `--show-keys`: The `--show-keys` flag, when used with the `profile list` command, displays each profile's unique API key alongside its name and other relevant information (e.g., application name, environment, etc.). This helps users quickly identify and use their desired profile while working with the New Relic platform or CLI tools.
