documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `systemctl daemon-reload` command is used to reload the systemd manager''s configuration files. Systemd is a system and session manager for Linux operating systems, and it uses configuration files to manage various services and other system components. This command is typically used when changes have been made to those configuration files, such as adding or modifying system services, to ensure that the systemda daemon recognizes the new or updated configurations. The command itself does not make any modifications to the configuration files, but rather reads them again into the systemd manager''s memory so that it can properly manage the affected services.'
