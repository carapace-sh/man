documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `brew tc` command is not a valid command for Homebrew, which is a popular package manager for macOS. There seems to be some confusion as it does not exist in the standard Homebrew installation. If you meant to run a command related to TLS/SSL certificates or TCP/IP utilities, please check the specific tool or software that provides this functionality and use its appropriate command instead.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `brew tc --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `tc` stands for "tools-compilation," and this specific command launches the compilation of Homebrew''s Tools tap (repository) with debugging information enabled. This helps in providing more detailed output during the build process, which can be useful when troubleshooting issues or gaining insights into how Homebrew builds its packages.'
        dir: '[AI] `brew tc --dir` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command is used to install or manage the TensorFlow CMake build system (tc) and specifies the installation directory as an argument. The flag `--dir` allows the user to choose the exact path where the TensorFlow CMake files will be installed, instead of accepting Homebrew''s default location.'
        file: |-
            [AI] The `brew tc --file` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command is for managing and configuring TLS certificates using Homebrew's `tls` component.

            The `--file` option indicates that the command will work on a specific file. When you run `brew tc --file <path-to-certificate>`, Homebrew will take the specified certificate file, check its validity and trustworthiness, and if it's deemed acceptable, add it to macOS's Keychain.

            This is useful when dealing with self-signed certificates or certificates not issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). By adding the certificate to your system's Keychain, macOS will trust the certificate and allow secure connections using that certificate for SSL/TLS protocols.
        fix: |-
            [AI] `brew tc --fix` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to repair broken installations or permissions of installed packages. The `tc` stands for "Tap Checkout," which is a subcommand used to manage Homebrew taps (external repositories of Homebrew formulas).

            The `--fix` flag instructs Homebrew to attempt to fix any issues it identifies during the checkout process, such as broken symlinks or incorrect file permissions. It will automatically download and install any missing dependencies or update existing packages if necessary. In summary, `brew tc --fix` is a troubleshooting command used to maintain a healthy Homebrew installation by repairing potential issues with installed packages.
        help: '[AI] `brew tc` is a command used with Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. The `--help` option is used to display detailed information about a specific Homebrew command or formula. In this case, `brew tc --help` will show the usage and available options for the `tc` (terminal control) formula installed via Homebrew. It helps users understand how to effectively use the terminal control utility.'
        ignore: |-
            [AI] The `brew tc --ignore` command is used with Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. This specific command is part of Homebrew's `tap` subcommand, which helps manage and install third-party Homebrew taps (repositories).

            The `--ignore` flag tells Homebrew to skip the installation or update of a particular tap when running other brew commands like `brew upgrade` or `brew install`. By specifying a tap name after the flag, e.g., `brew tc --ignore my-tap`, Homebrew will exclude that tap from being updated or installed during its next run.
        quiet: '[AI] The `brew tc --quiet` command is used in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS, to check for available updates for Homebrew itself and its installed formulas (packages) without displaying any progress or status messages. The `--quiet` option suppresses the output of detailed information during the update check process.'
        suggest-typed: |-
            [AI] `brew tc --suggest-typed` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command is part of Homebrew Tap `homebrew-tap/td-libmcsf`, which installs the TensorFlow Dataflow (TFD) library.

            The command `--suggest-typed` generates suggestions for TensorFlow and related packages with type annotations, helping developers to use these libraries more effectively in their projects that require static typing. These type annotations are particularly useful when working with languages like Swift, which have strong static typing requirements.
        update: '[AI] `brew tap homebrew/tc` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to install or update the Homebrew Tap named "homebrew/tc". The `--update` flag specifically instructs Homebrew to check for and install any available updates for the packages managed by this Tap.'
        update-all: '[AI] `brew tc --update-all` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command is used to update all components of Homebrew''s Tap Cask, which is an extension that simplifies the installation and management of macOS applications packaged as bundles. The `--update-all` flag tells Homebrew to check for updates for every component in the Cask repository and install any available updates.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] The `brew tc --verbose` command is used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to check the availability and authenticity of Tracker Command (tc) software updates. Here's a brief explanation:

            1. `brew` is the Homebrew command-line interface.
            2. `tc` refers to the Tracker Command software.
            3. `--verbose` option enables detailed output for troubleshooting and understanding the progress of the command.
            4. The entire command (`brew tc --verbose`) checks for updates, downloads them if available, and installs them, providing detailed information about each step in the process. If an update is not available, it will inform you that the latest version is already installed.
