documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git submodule sync` is a Git command used to synchronize the submodules in your Git repository with their respective repositories. It fetches, merges or rebase the latest changes from the submodule''s origin and updates the local submodule accordingly. This command ensures that the submodules are in the same state as their source repositories.'
    flag:
        recursive: '[AI] `git submodule sync --recursive` is a Git command used to update all the nested Git repositories (submodules) within a parent project to their latest versions. The `--recursive` option tells Git to follow the entire directory tree for any submodules, updating them recursively instead of just those listed in the .gitmodules file at the current location. This command is useful when you want to ensure that all your submodules are up-to-date with their respective projects before committing or pushing changes to a remote repository.'
