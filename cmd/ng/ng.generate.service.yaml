documentation:
    command: '[AI] `ng generate service` is a command used in Angular CLI to create a new Angular Service. It generates a new TypeScript file under the `src/app` directory with the given name and sets up the necessary metadata, imports, and an empty implementation for the service.'
    flag:
        flat: '[AI] `ng generate service --flat` is a command used in Angular for generating a new Angular service file. The `--flat` option instructs the Angular CLI to not create associated files like components, interfaces, or other supporting files, keeping only the minimal service file structure. This can be useful when you want to write your own implementation details for the service, without the extra generated scaffolding.'
        project: '[AI] The `ng generate service --project` command is used in Angular to create a new service within an existing Angular project. The `--project` flag specifies which Angular project''s `angular.json` file should be targeted for the generation of the new service. This allows you to create services in multiple projects within the same workspace. When run, Angular will generate the necessary files for a new service with default functionality and structure.'
        skip-tests: '[AI] The `ng generate service --skip-tests` command is used in Angular to create a new service without generating test files. Angular''s CLI (Command Line Interface) generates various files and directories when creating a new service, including a corresponding test file using Jasmine and Karma testing frameworks. However, if you want to skip the generation of these test files, you can use the `--skip-tests` option when running the command. This will create only the necessary files for the service without generating the test files.'
