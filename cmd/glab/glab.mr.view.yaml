    command: '[AI] The `glab mr view` command is used in GitLab to open a Merge Request (MR) for review in a graphical interface. It opens the default web browser and navigates to the specified MR in GitLab''s web interface, allowing users to inspect changes, discuss, and merge the request. This can be helpful for teams that want to collaborate on code changes more effectively in real-time.'
    flag:
        comments: '[AI] `glab` is a Git interface tool for the Kubernetes command-line client, `kubectl`. The command `glab mr view --comments` retrieves the comments associated with a merge request in a Git repository that is connected to a Kubernetes cluster. This can be useful for reviewing the discussion and feedback on proposed changes before deciding whether to merge them into your own branch or cluster.'
        page: '[AI] `glab` is a Git interface for the Kubernetes command-line tool `kubectl`. The command `glab mr view --page` is used to display a page of pull requests (MRs for Merge Requests in GitLab) in GitLab. The `--page` option specifies which page of results to display. For example, `glab mr view --page 2` would show the second page of pull requests.'
        per-page: '[AI] `glab` is a GitHub Action for local development, and `mr` stands for "pull request." The `--per-page` option is used with `glab mr view` command to display a specific number of pull requests per page when listing them in the terminal. For example, `glab mr view --per-page 10` will show ten pull requests at a time. This can be helpful for managing and navigating through large numbers of pull requests.'
        system-logs: '[AI] The command `glab mr view --system-logs` is a GitLab CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) pipeline command using Glab, a GitLab CLI tool. This command is used to view the system logs of a specific GitLab merge request (MR). The `--system-logs` flag instructs Glab to display the underlying container logs that were generated during the MR''s execution in the GitLab CI/CD environment.'
        web: '[AI] The `glab mr view --web` command is used with GitLab''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, Glab. It specifically brings up a web interface for viewing a merge request in a web browser. The `mr` stands for Merge Request and the `view` flag indicates that we want to open it for viewing. The `--web` option opens the interface directly in a web browser instead of using the terminal or command-line output.'
