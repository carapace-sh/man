name: kubectl
description: Runs a kubectl command on a Kubernetes cluster.

    command: |-
        [AI] `tsh` is not a recognized Kubernetes command or tool. However, `kubectl` is the official CLI (Command-Line Interface) for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster managing and deploying applications, configuring and extending Kubernetes, and getting information from the cluster.

        Therefore, there's no such command as "tsh kubectl". If you meant to use `kubectl` by itself, it would require further context to execute a specific action like creating a deployment or describing a pod.
