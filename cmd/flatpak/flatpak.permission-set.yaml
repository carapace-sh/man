        [AI] The `flatpak permission-set` command is used to manage application permissions in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux desktops. This command allows you to view, add, remove or modify the permissions granted to a specific Flatpak application or its runtime.

        You can use it with various options such as:
        - `list`: Display the current permissions for a given application or all applications.
        - `add <permissions> <application>`: Grant new permissions to an application.
        - `remove <permissions> <application>`: Remove permissions from an application.
        - `modify <permissions> <application>`: Modify the existing permissions for an application.

        This command helps you control which resources and system capabilities are accessible to Flatpak applications, enhancing security and maintaining fine-grained control over your system.

        data: |-
            [AI] `flatpak permission-set` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux desktop applications. The `--data` option specifies that the command should be run on data files or directories associated with an installed application.

            The `permission-set` subcommand lists or sets permissions for the given data items. It can be used to grant or revoke various access rights, such as read, write, execute, or network access, for specific data files or directories.

            For example, `flatpak permission-set --data <app-id> <path>` grants or revokes permissions for the given file or directory under an installed application with the specified app ID. It's a way to control access to data of applications installed using Flatpak.
        help: '[AI] `flatpak permission-set` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. This command sets or modifies permissions for installed applications or runtimes. The option `--help` displays the usage and available options for this command, providing a brief description of each argument. It helps users to understand how to use the command correctly for managing permissions in their Flatpak environment.'
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] The `flatpak permission-set` command is used to manage permissions for Flatpak applications. The `--ostree-verbose` option is used with this command to display detailed information about the OSTree file system transactions that are being made while setting or modifying application permissions. This option can be helpful for debugging and understanding the underlying changes being made to the file system by Flatpak when setting permissions for applications using OSTree as the backend.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak permission-set` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux platforms. The command `permission-set` with the `--verbose` option displays detailed information about the permissions granted to a specific Flatpak application or runtime. The output includes the application or runtime name, its ID, the set of permissions it requires or is granted, and their corresponding access levels (e.g., allow, deny, ask). This command provides valuable insight into how applications interact with the system and helps in troubleshooting permission-related issues.'
