documentation:
    command: '[AI] `consul event` is a Command Line Interface (CLI) command provided by Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. This command is used to monitor and display events from the Consul server or specific services registered with it in real-time. The output shows relevant information about each event, such as the event type, source, and data, helping users stay informed about changes within their Consul environment.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] The `consul event` command is a part of Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. The `--ca-file` option is used to specify the file path of a custom CA (Certificate Authority) certificate for secure communication between Consul servers in a datacenter or when interacting with TLS-enabled Consul services. This flag helps ensure secure events are only processed from trusted sources, increasing security within your Consul environment.'
        ca-path: '[AI] `consul event` is a command in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. The `--ca-path` option specifies the location of a trusted CA (Certifying Authority) certificate file. When using TLS (Transport Layer Security), this flag ensures that only events signed by the specified CA are accepted as valid. This adds an additional layer of security to event notifications in Consul.'
        client-cert: '[AI] The `--client-cert` flag in Consul''s CLI (Command Line Interface) `event` command is used to specify a client certificate file when interacting with the Consul HTTP API as a client. This flag ensures secure communication between the client and the Consul server by presenting a valid TLS client certificate during the API request. The provided certificate file should be in PEM format and contain both the private key and the public certificate in separate sections. Using this flag helps maintain the security of your service discovery and configuration management system.'
        client-key: '[AI] The `consul event` command is a tool from the Consul service discovery and configuration management platform. The `--client-key` option is used to specify a client key for an agent or application that interacts with the Consul server. This key is required to authenticate and authorize access to certain features, such as watching for events related to specific keys or services. Without a valid client key, the `consul event` command will not be able to subscribe to the desired events from the Consul server.'
        http-addr: '[AI] The `--http-addr` flag in Consul''s CLI (Command Line Interface) command `event` is used to specify the HTTP address where events will be served. By default, Consul listens for events on its interface with the address `localhost`, but you can use this flag to change it to any valid IP address or domain name along with a port number (e.g., `--http-addr 192.168.0.1:8501`). This allows other applications or users to consume Consul events through HTTP.'
        name: '[AI] `consul event` is a command from the Consul service discovery and configuration tool. The `--name` flag is used to specify the name of an event or a filter for events in Consul''s event stream. When you run `consul event --name <event_name>`, it will display only the events with the specified name, helping you monitor specific events related to your services and configuration in the Consul ecosystem.'
        node: |-
            [AI] The `flag "consul event --node"` is used with Consul, a service discovery and configuration management tool. This flag is specifically for the Consul Event API, which allows users to subscribe to events related to the Consul service registry.

            When you run the command `consul event --node`, it tells Consul to provide information about nodes (agents) in the cluster. The output includes events related to node joining or leaving the cluster, along with details such as IP address, agent name, and status.

            This flag can be useful for monitoring changes to your Consul agents and staying informed about their availability and membership within the cluster.
        service: '[AI] The `flag "consul event --service"` is used with Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This specific flag is related to the Consul Event API. When this flag is passed to a Consul CLI command, it instructs the command to filter events by the specified service name. The goal is to observe and react to changes in the state of the registered services in the Consul cluster.'
        tag: '[AI] The `consul event` command is a part of Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. The `--tag` option allows filtering events based on specific tags assigned to services or nodes in the Consul cluster. When using this option, only events related to the specified tag will be displayed. For instance, running `consul event --tag my_service` would show events only for the service with the "my\_service" tag.'
        tls-server-name: '[AI] `consul event` is a command from the Consul service discovery and configuration tool. The `--tls-server-name` option is used to specify a TLS server name for secure communication between Consul clients and servers during events subscriptions. This allows configuring Consul to use a specific server''s TLS certificate when listening for event notifications, ensuring secure communication and preventing potential man-in-the-middle attacks.'
        token: '[AI] The `consul event --token` command is used in Consul, a Connect and Service Mesh platform by Hashicorp. This command triggers an event in Consul and provides it with a token for authentication. The event could be used to notify applications about various changes in the Consul service registry, such as new or deleted services or changes in their health status. The token is required to ensure that only authorized clients can receive these notifications.'
        token-file: '[AI] The `consul event` command is a tool provided by Hashicorp Consul, an open-source distributed config management and service discovery platform. The `--token-file` option is used to specify the path to a file containing an Access Token or ACL token. This token is required to authenticate and authorize access to events in Consul''s event API. By using this flag, users can securely provide their tokens without having to hardcode them in the command line.'
