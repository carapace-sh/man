documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `git notes get-ref` command is used to retrieve the current reference (a pointer to a branch or commit) of a Git note. Notes are a feature in Git that allow storing annotations, similar to comments, with specific commits. However, they have their own unique namespace and are accessed using references specifically for notes. This command retrieves the reference of the currently active Git note.'
