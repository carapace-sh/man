documentation:
    command: '[AI] `faas-cli secret list` is a command used with the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) CLI tool to display a list of stored secrets in the local Faas-NET Core configuration store. The secrets are encrypted and managed by the Faas-Net Core deployment tool, allowing secure handling of sensitive information such as API keys or database passwords.'
    flag:
        gateway: '[AI] `faas-cli secret list --gateway` is a command used with the FaaS (Function as a Service) CLI tool to list the secrets managed by a specific Faas gateway. Secrets are encrypted environment variables that can be used in Faa functions to store sensitive information such as API keys or database passwords. By using `--gateway` option, you specify which Faas gateway you want to query for its secret list.'
        namespace: '[AI] The `faas-cli secret list --namespace` command is used with the FaaS-CLI (Function as a Service Command Line Interface) tool. This command lists all the secrets in a specific Kubernetes namespace. Secrets are encrypted data that can be used to provide sensitive information, such as API keys or database passwords, to your functions without exposing them in the source code or as plain text in the environment variables. The `--namespace` flag specifies the name of the Kubernetes namespace where you want to list the secrets.'
        tls-no-verify: '[AI] The `faas-cli secret list --tls-no-verify` command is used with the FaaS-cli (Function as a Service Command Line Interface) tool to list the available secrets in a FaaS (Function as a Service) system, such as OpenFaaS or Fn. The `--tls-no-verify` flag disables TLS certificate verification during the connection to the FaaS backend API server. This can be useful when connecting to an untrusted or self-signed certificate environment, but it is important to note that using this option may expose your communication to potential security risks.'
        token: '[AI] `faas-cli secret list --token` is a command used with the FaaS-CLI (Function-as-a-Service Command Line Interface) tool. This command lists all the secrets stored in your FaaS provider''s key management system, which can be accessed using the provided token. The flag `--token` specifies the authentication token required to access the secrets. It''s essential for security reasons that this token is kept confidential, as it grants access to manage and retrieve sensitive information.'
