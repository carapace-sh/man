documentation:
    command: '[AI] `npm start` is a command used in Node.js projects to start the application based on the scripts defined in the `package.json` file under the key `scripts > start`. This command typically runs the primary entry point of your application using Node.js and sets up various development features such as automatic file watching, hot module replacement, and other default behaviors for a more seamless development experience.'
    flag:
        ignore-scripts: '[AI] The `npm start --ignore-scripts` command is used when you want to bypass or ignore the scripts defined in a project''s `package.json` file during the execution of the `npm start` command. This can be useful if, for instance, the existing scripts don''t fit your needs, or if you want to run specific custom scripts instead. The `--ignore-scripts` option tells npm not to execute any scripts defined in the `scripts` section of the `package.json`.'
        script-shell: '[AI] `npm start --script-shell` is a command used in Node.js projects managed with npm (Node Package Manager). This command starts the default script listed in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file, using the specified shell for executing child processes. The flag `--script-shell` lets you specify the shell to use, which by default is `node-repl-engine`. By providing a different value, you can run your scripts in other shell environments like Bash or PowerShell. This can be useful when dealing with scripts that have specific requirements for their execution environment.'
