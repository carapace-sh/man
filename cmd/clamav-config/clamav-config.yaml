documentation:
    command: '[AI] "clamav-config" is a command used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, malware etc. The command is typically used to configure various settings and parameters of the ClamAV scanner, such as the location of the virus definition files or the logging options. It can be invoked with different arguments to modify specific configuration aspects. For example: clamav-config --help will display a list of available options; clamav-config --dbpath /path/to/database will set the database path.'
    flag:
        cflags: '[AI] `clamav-config --cflags` is a command provided by ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine. This command is used to retrieve the compiler flags required to build ClamAV''s applications from source. In simpler terms, it returns the flags that should be passed to the compiler when building ClamAV software, such as `-I`, `-L` and `-l` flags for including header files, linking libraries, respectively. These flags help ensure proper interaction between the ClamAV source code and the development environment.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `clamav-config` is a command-line utility for managing ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine. The option `--help` provides users with a summary of available commands and their usage. Here's what you can expect when using this command:

            1. When run without any arguments, it shows a brief overview of the available subcommands, such as `db`, `update`, `freshclam`, etc., and their descriptions.
            2. When followed by a specific subcommand, for example, `clamav-config db --help`, it displays detailed information about that particular command and its options.
            3. The help output is user-friendly, providing clear descriptions, examples, and default values when applicable. It also includes usage notes and potential error messages to guide users in utilizing the tool effectively.
        libs: '[AI] `clamav-config --libs` is a command used with ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, and other malware on Linux systems. The command `--libs` returns the compiler flags required to link against ClamAV libraries. In simpler terms, it provides the necessary flags for compiling software that uses ClamAV''s antivirus scanning functionality.'
        prefix: '[AI] The `clamav-config --prefix` command is used to set or retrieve the prefix directory for ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine. The prefix directory is where ClamAV installs its binaries, libraries, and configuration files. By default, ClamAV installs in the /usr/local directory, so running `clamav-config --prefix` will return "/usr/local". If you want to install ClamAV in a non-default location, you can use the `--prefix` option when configuring and building ClamAV from source. For example, `./configure --prefix=/my/custom/installation/path`.'
        version: '[AI] `clamav-config --version` is a command used with ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software suite. The command is used to display the version information of the ClamAV configuration files, not the ClamAV virus database or daemon itself. This can be useful for ensuring that you have the correct configuration files for your specific version of ClamAV installed.'
