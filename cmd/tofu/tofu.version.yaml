    command: '[AI] The term "tofu version" is not a standard command or term in computing or technology.

            [AI] The `"tofu version -json"` flag is not a standard flag for any widely used technology or software. It seems to be a custom flag specific to an unknown context. However, based on the name, we can make some educated guesses.

            The term "tofu" suggests that this flag might be related to data serialization or transformation in a specific system or application that uses JSON as its default format. The `-version` part implies that this flag may provide information about the version of the data schema or format being used.

            However, without more context, it is impossible to provide a definitive explanation for this flag. If you have access to the documentation or source code of the system or application using this flag, consult that for accurate information.
