documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea pulls list` command is used in the Tectonic (now Docker Tectonic) container orchestration platform to retrieve a list of available Helm repositories and their respective chart versions that can be installed using Tectonic''s Helmfile. This command does not install or update any charts but merely lists the options available for installation.'
    flag:
        fields: '[AI] The `--fields` option used with the `teapulls list` command in TeaVM (Teaspoon Virtual Machine) is used to specify a comma-separated list of fields to be displayed when listing Tea Pulls. This helps in filtering and focusing on specific information while managing dependencies for your Tea projects.'
        limit: '[AI] The `teapulls list --limit` command is used in GitHub''s Octopus or GitFlow workflows to retrieve a specific number of items (limited by the specified value) from the pull request queue. It displays details like the pull request numbers, branch names, and commit messages for each item. This command helps users manage their pull requests more efficiently by allowing them to review and merge multiple PRs in batches.'
        login: '[AI] `teaproject pull list --login` is a command used in TeaProject, an open-source continuous delivery tool. This command retrieves a list of available Docker image updates, also known as "changes," that can be pulled and applied to your application infrastructure. The `--login` option includes an authentication step, allowing access to private Docker registries, ensuring the images are securely fetched before being pulled and deployed.'
        output: '[AI] `tea pull list --output` is a command from the Tectonic (now Docker Tectonic) container orchestration platform. It lists all the available Kubernetes charts in your Tectonic repository and saves the output to a file specified by the `--output` flag, typically a YAML or JSON file for easier consumption and processing by other scripts or tools.'
        page: |-
            [AI] The `tea pull list --page` command is used in GitHub's Terminal or Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing repositories with the Tea CLI tool. This specific command fetches a list of pull requests from a particular page on a repository, starting from the first page by default.

            Using `--page` allows you to navigate through multiple pages of open pull requests. For example, if you want to view the second page of pull requests, use `tea pull list --page 2`. This command is helpful when dealing with larger repositories that have numerous open pull requests.
        remote: '[AI] The `--remote` option in the `teap pulls list` command is used to fetch the remote repository''s branch or tag list instead of the local one. In other words, it retrieves the list of branches or tags available on a remote Git repository, which can be useful when working with distributed versions control systems to keep track of the latest updates or perform merging and pulling tasks.'
        repo: '[AI] The `teap pulls list --repo` command is used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to display a list of repositories that are currently added as sources for Helm charts. Each repository URL is shown with its respective chart versions and last updated timestamp. This command helps users manage their Helm repositories and keep track of available charts.'
        state: '[AI] `tea pull list --state` is a command used in the Teaspoon CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for Kubernetes, specifically for managing Helm Charts. This command is used to display the current state of all the Helm releases, which are listed as revisions and their corresponding charts, values files, and namespaces in your local `tea/releases` directory. It helps users keep track of their deployed applications and their associated configurations.'
