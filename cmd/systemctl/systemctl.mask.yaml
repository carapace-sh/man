group: unit file
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl mask` is a command used in Linux systemd environments to hide and prevent the enabling or disabling of a systemd service or target without modifying its configuration file. By using this command followed by the name of the unit file, you create a symlink with the suffix ".past" in the /etc/systemd/system directory that masks the original unit file. This means that the given service or target cannot be enabled or disabled but is still present in the system. The masked unit can be unmasked using `systemctl unmask` command to make it manageable again.'
