    command: '[AI] `tmux customize-mode` is a TMUX command used to open the TMUX configuration editor in an interactive mode, allowing users to modify various aspects of their TMUX sessions via a menu-driven interface. This editor enables easy editing and exploration of the underlying TMUX configuration files (primarily `~/.tmux.conf`). Making modifications within this editor automatically saves changes, reducing the need for manually editing configuration files directly.'
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `tmux customize-mode -F` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to enter the customization mode interactively. The `-F` option stands for "force," which means that Tmux will overwrite any existing changes in the configuration file without asking for confirmation. In this way, you can apply new customizations directly and immediately see their effects, making it useful for testing or experimenting with new configurations.'
        f: '[AI] `tmux customize-mode -f` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to load and apply customizations from a configuration file. The `customize-mode` starts an interactive session where you can modify various aspects of your tmux environment, and the `-f` option followed by a file path argumnet, tells tmux to read and apply the changes from that specific file upon entering the customization mode.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux customize-mode -t` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to enter the customization mode with the given name or target `-t`. In this mode, you can modify various aspects of your tmux configuration such as keys bindings, window layouts, and other settings using the built-in editor (VI or Vim) or an external editor. The changes made in this mode will persist across sessions once saved.'
