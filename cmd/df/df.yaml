documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `df` (Disk File System) command is a Linux utility used to display file system disk space usage. It shows the total and used space, as well as available free space, of mounted file systems in various formats. Users can view file system partitions, directories or specific files, along with their corresponding file system types and mount points. The output can be customized through options such as `-h` (human readable) or `-T` (show file system type).'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `df --all` is a Linux command used to display the filesystem disk usage of mounted file systems. The `--all` option makes the output include otherwise hidden filesystems, such as those using automatic mounting or those that are not currently mounted but were previously mounted. It provides more comprehensive information about the available disk space across all filesystems in the system.'
        block-size: '[AI] `df --block-size` is a command used in Unix and Linux operating systems to report file system disk space usage. The `--block-size` option specifies the size with which to print the usage - typically in 1KB, 1MB or 1GB units. By default, it displays sizes in 1KB blocks. This command helps users understand how much storage is being used by files and directories on different file systems and can be useful for capacity planning and troubleshooting disk space issues.'
        exclude-type: '[AI] The `df --exclude-type` command is a Linux utility used to display file system disk usage statistics. The `--exclude-type` option filters out filesystems of specified types from the output. This can be useful when dealing with multiple filesystems and you want to focus on specific ones. For example, `df --exclude-type tmpfs` will exclude temporary filesystems (of type `tmpfs`) from the output.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `df --help` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems to display the file system disk usage of mounted filesystems. The `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use the `df` command, including available options and their meanings. Here's a brief overview:

            - Displays usage statistics for file systems.
            - By default, shows filesystem size, used space, availabilty, and percentage used.
            - Can display additional columns like inode usage and mount point.
            - Options can be used to customize output, such as `--block-size` or `--human-readable`.
            - The `--help` option displays detailed help information for using the command effectively.
        human-readable: '[AI] `df --human-readable` is a command in Unix and Linux operating systems used to display the file system disk usage of mounted filesystems. The `--human-readable` option makes the output more readable by displaying numbers with units (e.g., "10M" instead of "10485760"). This helps users understand how much space is being used at a glance, as they can easily tell that "10M" means ten megabytes.'
        inodes: '[AI] The `df --inodes` command is a Linux utility used to display file system disk usage statistics. The `--inodes` option specifically displays the number of in-use and available inodes in each filesystem. An inode is a data structure that stores metadata about a file or directory, including ownership information, permissions, and pointers to the data blocks that store the actual file content. By examining the inode usage, you can gain insight into the number of files and directories occupying the space on a filesystem.'
        k: '[AI] The `df -k` command is a Linux utility used to display the disk file system usage of mounted file systems in the system. The `-k` option stands for "kilobytes," meaning that the output will be displayed in units of kilobytes, making it easier to understand and compare larger file systems. The output includes columns for File System, Size, Used, Avail, Use%, and Mounted on, providing valuable information about disk usage.'
        local: '[AI] The `df --local` command is a Linux utility used to display the file system disk usage of mounted file systems. The `--local` option is optional and specifically requests the output to only include the local file systems, excluding any remotely mounted filesystems. The output shows columns for file system, size, used space, available space, percentage of use, and mount point.'
        no-sync: '[AI] The `df --no-sync` command in Linux is used to display the file system disk usage statistics without waiting for any ongoing file system updates or syncing to complete first. The `--no-sync` option disables the synchronization of in-memory file system metadata to disk before displaying the output, which can make the command run faster, especially when dealing with large or busy file systems. However, it''s important to note that the output may not reflect the most up-to-date information on the actual disk usage since some changes might not have been written to disk yet.'
        output: '[AI] `df --output` is a command in Unix-based systems used to display file system disk usage statistics. The `--output` option allows specifying which columns or fields to be displayed. By default, it shows filesystem, size, used, available, and percentage used. For example, `df --output=used,percent` would only display the "used" and "% used" columns.'
        portability: |-
            [AI] The `df --portability` command is a variation of the standard Unix `df` (Disk File System) command used to report file system disk space usage. This specific option, `--portability`, is included in some versions of df to ensure output format compatibility across different operating systems, such as Linux and macOS.

            By using this flag, the output of the df command will be displayed in a way that is consistent with other widely used Unix-based systems, helping to avoid potential issues when moving or sharing file system reports between them.
        print-type: '[AI] `df --print-type` is a command in Unix and Linux operating systems used to display filesystem disk usage information. The `--print-type` option specifically requests that the output include a column showing the filesystem type for each mounted file system. This can help distinguish between different types of filesystems (such as ext4, xfs, or ntfs) and understand their specific characteristics.'
        si: '[AI] `df --si` is a Linux command used to display file system disk usage in human-readable format. The `--si` option makes the output use sizes in units of 1,024 (K), 1,048,576 (M), 1,073,741,824 (G), and so on. For example, it will display "50M" instead of "52912kB". The command shows file system, mount point, total space used and available, percent used, and the mount point type.'
        sync: '[AI] The `df --sync` command is used in Unix-like operating systems to check the amount of disk space used by files and directories in the file system, while also forcing the filesystem to update its on-disk metadata to reflect any recently written data. In simpler terms, it displays the disk usage statistics and ensures that all data is immediately written to the disk.'
        total: '[AI] `df --total` is a Linux command used to display the total disk space usage of all mounted file systems in a tabular format. The `--total` option provides the sum of the used and available space for each file system. The output shows columns for File System, Used, Avail, Use%, Mounted on, and Type. It helps monitor the overall disk usage across the file systems.'
        type: '[AI] The `df --type` command is a Linux utility used to display filesystem disk usage statistics. The `--type` option filters the output to show only the filesystem types, while the default output includes both filesystem type and mount point information. This can be useful when dealing with multiple file systems or when you want to focus on the specific file system types in your system.'
        v: '[AI] The command `df -v` in Linux is used to display the file system disk usage. The `-v` option stands for "verbose," which means it provides more detailed output than the default usage without this option. Specifically, it displays each partition or filesystem with additional columns showing the mount point, type, and other information. It also allows long format output when used with other file systems such as ext4. The main columns displayed are File System, Size, Used, Avail, Use%, and Mounted on.'
        version: '[AI] The `df --version` command is used to display the version information of the `df` (Disk Filesystem) utility in Unix-like operating systems. It returns the version number and sometimes other relevant information about the implementation of the df tool, helping users ensure they are running the latest or required version for their use case.'
