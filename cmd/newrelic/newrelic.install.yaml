documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `newrelic install` command is used to install the New Relic agent, which is a software component that enables monitoring and performance optimization of applications. This command typically needs to be run in a terminal or command prompt with appropriate administrative privileges, depending on the operating system. It may require specifying the New Relic instrumentation key, application name, and other details during the installation process. Once executed, it downloads, installs, and configures the New Relic agent for your application.'
    flag:
        assumeYes: '[AI] `newrelic install --assume-yes` is a command used in New Relic''s agent installation process for various platforms, including Java, Node.js, and Python. The `--assume-yes` flag is an option that allows the installation to proceed without asking for user confirmation at each step. It assumes "yes" as the answer to all prompts during the installation process, making it a convenient choice when automating installations or when the user wants to minimize interactive input.'
        localRecipes: '[AI] `newrelic install --localRecipes` is a command used in New Relic, a software analytics company''s toolkit, to install and apply local recipes for specific applications or technologies during the agent installation process. Local recipes are configuration files that contain settings tailored to particular applications or frameworks, ensuring optimal performance monitoring once the agent is up and running. This command streamlines the setup by automatically detecting and configuring the specified application or technology based on the provided recipe file.'
        recipe: '[AI] The `newrelic install --recipe` command is used to install the New Relic agent in a cookbook-driven infrastructure using Chef, a configuration management tool. The "--recipe" option specifies the name of the Chef recipe file that manages the installation and configuration of the New Relic agent. After running this command, Chef will download, configure, and install the New Relic agent according to the instructions in the specified recipe.'
        recipePath: '[AI] The `newrelic install` command is used to install New Relic, a software performance monitoring solution, in various environments such as Docker or Kubernetes. The `--recipePath` option specifies the path to a custom recipe file that customizes the installation process. This could include specific configuration settings, dependencies, or build steps for your application environment. Using this flag allows for greater flexibility and control over the New Relic installation process.'
        tag: '[AI] `newrelic install --tag` is a command used in New Relic, a software performance monitoring tool. This command installs or configures an agent on a system with a specific tag. Agents are lightweight applications that collect and send data to the New Relic platform for real-time analysis and reporting. The `--tag` option allows you to assign a label or identifier to the installation, making it easier to manage and filter your agents within the New Relic dashboard.'
        testMode: '[AI] `newrelic install --testMode` is a command used in New Relic software performance monitoring tool. This command initiates an installation of the New Relic agent with the test mode enabled. Test mode runs the agent in a non-production environment, allowing users to verify if the configuration settings are correct before deploying it to production systems. It does not affect the running applications or make any changes to the database or network configuration.'
