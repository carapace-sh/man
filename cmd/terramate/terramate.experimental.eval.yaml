documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `terramate experimental eval` command is used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, to evaluate an Experimental module or configuration. Terraform''s experimental features are not enabled by default and may change between major versions, thus the need for a separate evaluation process. This command runs the specified experimental configuration through the Terraform engine without applying the resulting changes, allowing users to test its behavior before deploying it in production.'
    flag:
        as-json: '[AI] The `terramate experimental eval --as-json` command is used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, for evaluating expressions experimentally and returning the results in JSON format. This command is typically used during development to test complex logic or new features that are not yet ready for use in regular Terraform configuration files. The `--as-json` flag instructs the command to output the evaluation result as a JSON object instead of the default HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) format.'
        global: '[AI] The `terraform experimental eval --global` command is used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, to evaluate expressions or actions that are not part of the stable public API but may be under development. The `--experimental` flag enables the use of these experimental features, and the `--global` flag specifies that the evaluation should apply to the entire state, rather than just a specific resource or module. In summary, this command allows users to experiment with new Terraform functionality before it is officially released.'
