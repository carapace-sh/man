    command: '[AI] `dbt docs serve` is a command used in dbt (Data Build Tool), an open-source data transformation and testing toolkit. This command starts a local server for serving documentation generated by dbt''s `docs` feature. The served documentation can be accessed through a web browser at `http://localhost:8383` by default, allowing users to explore dbt models, tests, and other project metadata in an interactive format.'
    flag:
        no-browser: '[AI] The command `dbt docs serve --no-browser` is used in dbt (data build tool) projects to generate and serve documentation for the database models and tests defined in the dbt project. The `--no-browser` flag is optional but it disables the built-in web server with a local development server, meaning that the generated HTML files can be served using an existing web server like Apache or Nginx instead. This way, the documentation can be accessible via a custom domain name or integrated into other websites more easily.'
        port: '[AI] `dbt docs serve --port` is a command used in dbt (data build tool) to generate and serve documentation for dbt projects. The `--port` option specifies the port number on which the documentation server will run, allowing users to access it via a web browser by navigating to `localhost:<port_number>`. For example, `dbt docs serve --port 8001` starts the documentation server listening on port 8001.'
        profile: '[AI] `dbt docs serve --profile` is a command used in dbt (Data Build Tool), an open-source data transformation and orchestration toolkit. This command starts the dbt documentation server locally, using a specified profile to configure connection settings for data sources. It makes dbt documentation accessible at a given URL, allowing users to explore and understand the models, tests, transformations, and other elements in their dbt project more easily.'
        project-dir: '[AI] `dbt docs serve --project-dir` is a command used in dbt (Data Build Tool), an open-source data transformation and testing tool for data analysts and engineers. This specific command serves the generated documentation from the given dbt project directory using a local development server, making it accessible through a web browser at `http://localhost:8383` by default. It''s useful to share or collaborate on dbt projects with others and provides an easy-to-understand interface for exploring data models, tests, transformations, and documentation within the project.'
        target: '[AI] `dbt docs serve --target` is a command used in dbt (data build tool) for generating and serving interactive documentation for your dbt projects. The `--target` option specifies the output directory where generated HTML files will be placed. This command starts a local development server to serve the documentation, allowing you to view it in a web browser by visiting `http://localhost:8003` by default. Updating your dbt project will automatically update the served documentation as well.'
        vars: '[AI] `dbt docs serve --vars` is a command used in dbt (Data Build Tool), an open-source data transformation toolkit. This command generates and serves interactive documentation for dbt projects. The `--vars` flag is used to pass custom variables to the Jupyter Notebook server that dbt uses to render the docs. These variables can be used to customize the look and feel or behavior of the documentation. For example, you might use `--vars="notebook_config={''DisallowDeleteKey'': False}"` to allow deleting keys in the rendered Jupyter Notebooks.'
