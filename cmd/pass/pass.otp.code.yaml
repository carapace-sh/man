description: generate and print an OTP code from the secret key stored
flags:
    -c, --clip: copy to clipboard
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "pass otp code" is typically used in a Passwords Manager application, such as KeePass or LastPass. This command is meant to enter or submit an One-Time Password (OTP) or Two-Factor Authentication code that has been generated outside of the password manager and is required for login or authentication purposes alongside your username and password. It is important to note that this command should only be used when prompted by the password manager software itself, as entering OTP codes into applications without proper context could pose a security risk.'
    flag:
        clip: '[AI] The `--clip` flag in the command `pass otp code` is used with the password manager application Pass (from the macOS utility suite). This flag instructs Pass to copy the One-Time Password (OTP) code for a specific entry and place it directly into the system clipboard, ready for pasting into a login form or similar.'
