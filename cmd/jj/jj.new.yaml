        insert-after: '[AI] The `--insert-after` option in Git, specifically when used with the `git jj` (interactive rebase) command, instructs Git to insert a new commit at the position right after the specified commit in the current branch''s history. This results in an interactive rebase session where you can edit and amend the commits before they are applied on top of the base branch.'
        insert-before: '[AI] `git jj` is a Git extension for interactive rebasing, developed by Jeff King. The command `git jj new --insert-before <commit>` creates a new interactive rebase session and sets the stage to insert a new commit before the specified commit in the commit history. This allows users to modify or add new commits while maintaining the continuity of the existing branch.'

The `--message` option allows you to specify a commit message for the initial commit on the new branch. This command creates the branch from the current branch and sets up tracking, ready for pushing to a remote repository.'
