documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `flutter build windows` command is used to build a Flutter application for deployment on the Windows platform. It compiles the Dart code into native machine code using the Flutter engine, and packages it with necessary resources and configurations to generate an installable Windows application package (MSI or AppX) that can be distributed to users.'
    flag:
        analyze-size: '[AI] `flutter build windows --analyze-size` is a command used in Flutter development to analyze the size of a Windows application package before building it. The `--analyze-size` option triggers an analysis of the binary files that will be included in the final package, providing estimates for the space they will occupy. This information can help developers optimize their apps by identifying and removing unnecessary files or components, ultimately reducing the app''s size for a better user experience on Windows platforms.'
        dart-define: '[AI] `flutter build windows` is a command used in Flutter, a mobile app development framework, to build an application for the Windows platform. The `--dart-define` option that follows the build command allows defining constant values in the Dart code during the build process. This can be useful for passing configuration values or customizing behavior at build time without changing the source code directly. For example, you might define a flag to enable or disable certain features based on the target platform or environment. The format is `--dart-define name=value`.'
        debug: '[AI] `flutter build windows --debug` is a command used in Flutter development to build a Windows desktop application from the project''s source code. The `--debug` flag enables the generation of debug symbols and additional diagnostic data, which can be helpful during the testing and debugging process. This command creates an executable file for the application along with other necessary files, enabling you to run the app on a Windows system.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `flutter build windows --help` is a command used in Flutter, a mobile app development framework, to generate a Windows desktop application from the existing Flutter project. The `--help` argument displays detailed usage information about this specific Flutter build command. Here's what it does:

            1. It builds a Windows desktop application from your Flutter project using the Flutter tool.
            2. It generates an installer package (MSI or AppX) for the Windows platform.
            3. The `--help` flag provides information about the following:
               - Mandatory arguments such as the output directory where the generated application will be placed.
               - Optional arguments, like setting up a certificate for code signing or using a specific desktop icon.
               - Description of each argument and its purpose.
            4. It helps you understand how to use this command effectively while creating your Windows desktop app.
        no-analyze-size: '[AI] `flutter build windows --no-analyze-size` is a command used in Flutter development for building a Windows application package without running the size analysis during the build process. The `--no-analyze-size` option disables the Flutter tool from performing an optional size analysis of the generated code, which can help save time during the build process if not required. Otherwise, the default build command includes this analysis to provide information about the size and memory usage of the application.'
        no-null-assertions: |-
            [AI] `flutter build windows` is a command used in Flutter, a mobile app development framework, to build a Windows desktop application from its source code. The `--no-null-assertions` flag is an option that disables null safety checks during the build process.

            In Flutter 2.12 and later versions, null safety is enforced by default, meaning that the Dart compiler will not compile a program if it detects potential null reference errors. By using `--no-null-assertions`, you're asking the build system to ignore these checks, which can be useful when dealing with legacy code or third-party libraries that haven't been updated for null safety yet. Note that ignoring these checks can lead to runtime errors if null values are encountered in your application.
        no-obfuscate: '[AI] `flutter build windows --no-obfuscate` is a command used in Flutter development to build a Windows application from the project sources. The `--no-obfuscate` option instructs Flutter not to perform code obfuscation during the build process, meaning that the original code structure and names will be preserved in the output executable file. This can be useful for debugging or when sharing the application with collaborators.'
        no-pub: '[AI] `flutter build windows --no-pub` is a command used to build a Windows desktop application from a Flutter project. The `--no-pub` option disables the running of `pub get` during the build process, assuming that the required dependencies have already been installed locally using `flutter pub get`. This can lead to faster build times if you have large or multiple projects with similar dependency sets.'
        no-track-widget-creation: |-
            [AI] `flutter build windows --no-track-widget-creation` is a command used in Flutter, a UI toolkit from Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. This specific command is used to build a Windows application package without enabling the tracking of widget creation during the build process.

            The `--no-track-widget-creation` flag disables a performance optimization feature that tracks the creation of each widget in the application's user interface (UI) tree, allowing Flutter to generate more efficient code when building the Windows app package. By omitting this option, you may be sacrificing some build time efficiency gains for potentially other benefits like debugging or development speed.
        no-tree-shake-icons: '[AI] `flutter build windows` is a command used to build a Flutter application for the Windows platform. The `--no-tree-shake-icons` option disables tree shaking of icons during the build process. Tree shaking is a technique used in Flutter to exclude unused code at compile time, improving app size and performance. However, for desktop apps like Windows, icons are crucial for user experience, and some icons may not be detected during tree shaking. Thus, disabling tree shaking with `--no-tree-shake-icons` ensures that all the icons are included in the build, ensuring a comprehensive set of available icons for the end-user.'
        null-assertions: '[AI] `flutter build windows --no-root-check --release --dart-define=FLUTTER_BUILD_MODE=Release --mode release --target=windows --web-only --no-tree-shake-icons --disable-web-security --split-debug-info --no-code-coverage --no-analyze --no-logs --no-helg-check --no-sound-detection --disable-projector --no-annotations --no-long-message --enable-optimized-binary --null-assertions` is a command used in Flutter to build a Windows app from the source code. The `--null-assertions` flag enables null safety features in Dart, which allows the compiler to assume that all non-nullable types are not null at compilation time unless explicitly asserted. This can help catch potential null reference errors at compile time instead of runtime, improving application stability and reliability.'
        obfuscate: '[AI] `flutter build windows --obfuscate` is a command used in Flutter development to generate an obfuscated version of a Windows application. Obfuscation is a process that makes the code more difficult for others to read or understand, by renaming variables, removing comments and unnecessary code, and sometimes even encrypting parts of the code. This command combines building the Windows app with the `--obfuscate` option, which uses tools like ProGuard or R8 to perform obfuscation on the Dart code before compiling it into native Windows executable files.'
        profile: '[AI] The `flutter build windows --profile` command is used to build a Flutter application for the Windows platform and generates a standalone executable file. The `--profile` option enables the specified profile during the build process, which can be used for optimizing the build for different scenarios such as release mode or minimum size. This command creates an optimized executable with minimal startup time and memory usage.'
        pub: '[AI] `flutter build windows --pub` is a command used in Flutter development to create a Windows executable from the source code of a Flutter application. The `--pub` option indicates that dependencies managed by the Dart package manager, Pub, should be fetched and included in the build process. This command generates an installer package for the application that can be installed on Windows systems.'
        release: '[AI] `flutter build windows --release` is a command used in Flutter, a mobile app development framework, to generate a release version of an application for the Windows platform. This command performs several optimizations and minifies the code, resulting in smaller binaries with improved performance. Additionally, it builds and packages the application into a standalone executable file (MSI or AppX package) suitable for distribution.'
        split-debug-info: |-
            [AI] `flutter build windows --split-debug-info` is a command used in Flutter development to generate a Windows application package with split debug information.

            When building a Flutter application for Windows, the output is typically a single .exe file containing all the application code and debug information. However, this single file can be quite large, especially during development when frequent builds are common.

            The `--split-debug-info` option allows the debug information to be split into separate .pdb files for each individual DLL (Dynamic Link Library) instead of being embedded within the main executable. This results in smaller .exe file sizes and faster build times, making the development process more efficient.
        target: '[AI] `flutter build windows --target` is a command used in Flutter development to create a Windows-specific executable or package from an existing Flutter project. The `build` task invokes the Flutter construction system to compile and package the application, while `windows` specifies the target platform. The `--target` option determines the output format; it can be set to `appbundle` for creating an AppX bundle or `desktop` for a standalone executable. This command generates files suitable for distribution on the Windows operating system.'
        track-widget-creation: '[AI] `flutter build windows --track-widget-creation` is a command used in Flutter, a mobile app development framework, to build a Windows desktop application. The `--track-widget-creation` flag enables the creation of a widgets DLL during the build process. This DLL contains pre-initialized instances of the Flutter engine''s widgets and improves the startup time and reduces memory usage for the desktop app.'
        tree-shake-icons: '[AI] `flutter build windows` is a command used in Flutter development to create a Windows application from the project code. The `--tree-shake-icons` option enables icon size reduction through tree shaking, an optimization technique that eliminates unused code and resources. This results in smaller binary sizes for the final application. In summary, this command builds a Windows app with reduced icon file sizes by applying icon tree shaking during the build process.'
