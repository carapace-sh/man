        debug: '[AI] `brew postinstall --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs the `postinstall` script of a Homebrew installation with debugging output. The `postinstall` script is usually executed after the installation process to configure and set up the installed software. The `--debug` flag enables detailed debug information to be displayed during the execution of the script, which can be helpful for troubleshooting any issues that may arise during the installation or configuration process.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `brew postinstall` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. It's typically invoked automatically after installing or upgrading a Homebrew package. This command runs custom scripts that are installed along with the package to perform additional setup tasks, such as symlink creation or configuration file adjustments.

            The `--help` flag is used to display detailed information about how to use the `postinstall` command. It provides options for specifying a particular formula (package) to run postinstall commands for, as well as an explanation of the various environment variables and error handling behaviors that can be configured.
        quiet: '[AI] `brew postinstall --quiet` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs scripts in the Postinstall file of a recently installed Homebrew formula, silently (without displaying any messages). The `--quiet` option prevents progress and error messages from being displayed, making the installation process run more quietly in the background.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] `brew postinstall --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is executed automatically after the installation or upgrade of a Homebrew package. The `postinstall` script is included in the package's formula and is responsible for performing additional tasks that cannot be accomplished during the regular installation process.

            The `--verbose` flag increases the level of output, making the terminal display detailed information about the post-installation process, including the commands being executed and their respective outputs. This option helps in understanding the behind-the-scenes activities of the package installation or upgrade.
