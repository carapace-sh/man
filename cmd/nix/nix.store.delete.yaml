    command: |-
        [AI] `nix store delete` is a Nix package manager command used to remove a specifically identified Nix expression or file from the Nix store. The general syntax is:

        ```bash
        nix store delete <path-to-expression-or-file>
        ```

        This command deletes the specified expression or file from your Nix store, which in turn may lead to other dependencies being removed as well if they are no longer needed. It's important to be cautious when using this command since deleting a package might impact other packages that depend on it. Always double-check before executing the command.
    flag:
        arg: '[AI] The `nix-store delete` command is a part of Nix Package Manager, which is used to manage and install software packages in Linux systems. The `--arg` option is used to specify an argument for the deletion operation. The full command `nix store delete --arg <path>` deletes the specified path from the Nix store, which is a read-only file tree storing all Nix expressions and their builds. This command does not affect installed packages or configurations but removes the build artifacts and expressions associated with the given path.'
        argstr: '[AI] The `nix store delete` command is a part of Nix Package Manager, which allows managing software packages and their dependencies in a declarative way. The specific option `--argstr` is used to pass arguments to the deletion function, defined in a Nix expression or configuration file. With this option, you can provide additional information about what exactly should be deleted, such as a specific store path or a set of store paths. For example, `nix store delete --argstr ''my-package-version'' my-package` will delete the specific version of ''my-package'' named ''my-package-version''.'
        commit-lock-file: '[AI] The `nix store delete` command with the `--commit-lock-file` option is used to remove a specific Nix package and its associated lock file in the Nix store. This operation is atomic, meaning that it either succeeds completely or fails without making any changes if another process is modifying the package at the same time. By deleting both the package and its commit lock file, Nix ensures that there are no inconsistencies or conflicts within the store.'
        debug: |-
            [AI] `nix-store delete --debug` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command deletes files or directories from the Nix store, which is where Nix stores built packages and their dependencies.

            The `--debug` flag enables verbose output during the deletion process, providing more detailed information about what files are being deleted and any potential errors that may occur. It can be useful for troubleshooting or understanding the effects of a delete operation.
        debugger: '[AI] `nix-store delete --debugger` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command deletes a specific path from the Nix store, which is a read-only filesystem hierarchy where all Nix packages are installed. The `--debugger` flag enables extended debugging information to be printed during the deletion process. It can help in understanding what exactly is being deleted and any potential issues that might arise.'
        eval-store: '[AI] The `nix-store delete --eval-store` command is a Nix expression that deletes specific evaluated Nix store paths. This command does not directly interact with files or directories in the filesystem but instead manipulates the Nix store''s evaluation database. By providing a list of store paths as arguments, this command removes the associated evaluated expressions from the store, resulting in their deletion from the actual Nix store when the garbage collector runs next.'
        ignore-liveness: '[AI] The `nix store delete` command is used to remove Nix package caches or snapshots in Nix expression language (NixML) stores. The option `--ignore-liveness` tells Nix to delete the specified store entry regardless of its current state, i.e., even if it''s marked as "alive" and actively being used by some configuration or profile. This can be useful when you want to permanently remove a package cache entry that''s no longer needed but wasn''t marked as obsolete in Nix''s garbage collection process. However, be careful while using this command since deleting an ''alive'' store entry might lead to inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.'
        impure: '[AI] The `nix-store delete --impure` command is used to remove files or directories from the Nix expression tree in a NixOS or Nixpkgs system, but keeps their built outputs in the store if they are still needed by other dependencies. This means that the files will be removed from the cache and the file system, but their built outputs (symlinks to the actual data) will remain intact. This can help save disk space without affecting the functionality of the system.'
        include: '[AI] The `nix-store delete` command is a part of Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `--include` option is used to specify a list of paths or file hashes to be deleted from the Nix store. When you run `nix-store delete --include <path1> <path2> ...`, it will recursively delete files and directories under the given paths, as well as their symlinks, in the Nix store. Note that deleting files or directories from the Nix store may affect installed packages and their dependencies, so use this command with caution.'
        inputs-from: '[AI] The `nix store delete` command is a utility from Nix Package Manager, which is used to remove build artifacts and cached data from the Nix store. The `--inputs-from` option specifies one or more file paths or Nix expressions to be used as inputs for the deletion process. This means that only the outputs associated with those inputs will be deleted. It helps maintain a clean Nix store by selectively removing unnecessary data without interfering with the functioning of installed packages or configurations.'
        log-format: '[AI] `nix store delete` is a command in Nix Pakages Manager used to remove stored builds or configurations. The option `--log-format` specifies the format of the output log when deleting an entry. By default, it''s set to "plain", but you can choose other formats like "json" or "pretty". This flag does not affect the deletion action itself but only how the command reports the result of the operation.'
        no-registries: '[AI] The `nix store delete` command with the `--no-registries` option is used to delete files or directories from the Nix expression tree, which is a component of the Nix Package Manager. This command deletes the files and directories located under the store path (usually `/nix/store`) without affecting any registries. Registries are remote or local caches of Nix expressions, which define how software packages should be built and installed. By using `--no-registries`, you exclude those cached expressions from being modified during the deletion process.'
        no-update-lock-file: '[AI] The `nix store delete` command with the `--no-update-lock-file` option is used to delete a specific Nix package or file from the Nix store database, without updating or modifying the lock files that maintain consistency between the store and the system''s configuration. This can be useful when you want to remove an old version of a package without affecting your current system setup. It is important to note that using this command requires superuser privileges.'
        no-write-lock-file: |-
            [AI] The `nix store delete` command is a part of Nix Package Manager, which is used to manage software packages and their dependencies in a declarative and reproducible way. The `--no-write-lock-file` flag modifies the behavior of this command:

            When you use `nix store delete <path-to-store-item>`, it removes the specified item from the Nix store, which is a global cache of software packages and their dependencies. By default, this command acquires a write lock file to prevent concurrent deletions. However, with the `--no-write-lock-file` flag, you disable this safety mechanism, allowing multiple instances of the command to delete items from the store at the same time without checking for conflicts. This could potentially lead to inconsistent or incorrect state of your Nix store, and is generally discouraged unless you're aware of the risks and have a good reason to bypass the locking mechanism.
        override-flake: '[AI] The `nix store delete --override-flake` command is used to remove a specific Flake channel (a Nix expression that builds and manages packages) and its associated built outputs from the Nix store, even if those outputs are depended upon by other packages. The `--override-flake` flag allows deletion of the channel despite dependency conflicts. This command helps in managing the Nix store and keeping it clean by removing unused or outdated channels and their corresponding built outputs.'
        override-input: '[AI] The `nix store delete` command is a part of Nix Pakages Manager. It''s used to remove built or cached outputs from the Nix store, which is a central part of the Nix distribution system. The `--override-input` option is passed to this command when you want to force the removal of a specific input file even if it''s still being used by other outputs in the store. This can be useful when dealing with broken or unneeded inputs. However, using this option should be done carefully as removing an essential input might lead to breaking other builds in the system.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] `nix store delete --print-build-logs` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command deletes a specific Nix store entry and prints the build logs associated with that entry''s previous builds. It helps users keep their system clean while maintaining a record of build histories, which can be useful for debugging and tracking down issues.'
        quiet: '[AI] `nix store delete --quiet` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The command deletes a specific store entry permanently without displaying any output or confirmation messages. The `--quiet` option suppresses all informational messages during the execution of the command. In summary, it silently removes a Nix store item from the file system.'
        recreate-lock-file: '[AI] The `nix store delete` command is a part of Nix Package Manager, which is used to manage software packages and their dependencies in a declarative and reproducible way. The `--recreate-lock-file` option is used when you want to force delete a stored configuration or profile and recreate a new lock file. This can be useful if there are issues with the current lock file, such as corruption or version compatibility problems. When using this command, any files that are managed by Nix under the specified store path will be deleted. After deletion, a new lock file will be generated when you next call `nix-build` or `nix-env --install`.'
        update-input: '[AI] `nix store delete --update-input` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command deletes a specific Nix store entry and updates any dependencies that the deleted entry previously provided. The `--update-input` option ensures that the dependencies are rebuilt with the latest available versions to maintain consistency within the Nix environment.'
        verbose: '[AI] `nix store delete --verbose` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command is used to delete a specific store entry, which is a file or directory in the Nix store that stores built packages. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output displayed during the deletion process, providing more detailed information about what is being deleted.'
