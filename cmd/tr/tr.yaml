    command: |-
        [AI] `tr` is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It stands for "translate" or "transform." The main function of `tr` is to translate or transform the input data by replacing, deleting, or inserting characters.

        The basic syntax is: `tr [OPTION] ... STRING1 [STRING2]...`, where options (if any) modify the behavior of `tr`. The two strings define the input and output character sets, respectively.

        For example, `tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < file.txt` would convert all lowercase letters in a text file to uppercase. Other common usage includes deleting specific characters (e.g., `tr -d '\r' < file.txt`) and inserting characters at certain positions (e.g., `echo "hello" | tr '\n' '\r\n'`).
    flag:
        delete: '[AI] The `tr` (translate or transmit) command in Unix-like operating systems is used for translating or deleting characters. The option `--delete` is used with this command to delete specified characters instead of translating them. Thus, the flag `tr --delete` would delete occurrences of the specified characters from the input stream. For instance, `tr --delete ''\n'' < file.txt` would remove all newline characters (`\n`) from the content of the file.txt file.'
        help: '[AI] The `--help` option is a common command-line argument used in various Unix-like tools, including the `tar` and `grep` utilities. It is not a standalone flag but rather an argument that requests help or usage information from the respective command. When you run `tar tr --help`, what you are actually doing is executing the `tar` command with the `tr` (translate or transform) option followed by the `--help` argument. This will display the detailed help or usage message related to the `tr` option within the `tar` command, explaining how it functions and the arguments it supports.'
        squeeze-repeats: |-
            [AI] The `tr` command with the `--squeeze-repeats` option in Unix or Unix-like operating systems is used to translate or delete consecutive identical characters into a single character. In other words, it removes runs of consecutive identical characters from input and writes the result to output.

            For example, if we have a string "aaabbbbcc" and we apply `tr --squeeze-repeats < string.txt`, the output would be "abc".

            This option is particularly useful when dealing with compressed or corrupted data, where runs of identical characters are common. It can also be used for text processing tasks like removing extra spaces or tabs from a file.
        truncate-set1: '[AI] The `tr` command in Unix or Linux is a filter used for translating or deleting characters. The option `--truncate` or `-s` followed by an integer `N`, causes output to be truncated after N bytes, if the input exceeds that length. The option `--truncate-set1` (or `-C`) sets the replacement character for the truncation to ASCII character 1 (i.e., ^A), which is commonly used as a signal end-of-file marker in some contexts. So, this combination of options would truncate the output after N bytes, and use the character ^A as the replacement for the truncated data.'
        version: '[AI] The `tr` (translate or transpose) is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The `--version` option is used to display the version information of the `tr` command, including its name, version number, and compilation information. When you run `tr --version`, it will print out something like `tr: tr [Version]` where `[Version]` is the specific version number.'
