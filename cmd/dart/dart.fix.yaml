documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `dart fix` command is a utility provided by Dart, a programming language, to automatically apply suggested fixes for common coding errors and issues in your Dart source code. When you run this command in your terminal or IDE, it analyzes the codebase, identifies potential problems, and proposes corrections. After reviewing the proposed changes, you can decide to accept them, thereby applying the fixes directly to your code. This command is designed to save time by automating common coding tasks and improving code quality.'
    flag:
        apply: '[AI] The `dart fix --apply` command is a feature of the Dart language''s `analyzer` package. It automatically applies suggested fixes to identified issues in a Dart codebase, without requiring manual confirmation for each individual fix. This can save time and effort for developers by batch-applying multiple fixes at once. The `--apply` flag instructs the tool to make these changes directly to the files in the working directory, rather than just displaying the suggested changes for review.'
        dry-run: '[AI] The `dart fix` command with the `--dry-run` option is used to check and preview potential fixes for Dart code without actually applying those changes. This can be helpful in understanding what changes will be made before committing them, reducing the risk of unintended consequences. Essentially, it performs a analysis of your code and suggests possible improvements while showing you what these changes would look like without applying them yet.'
        help: '[AI] `dart fix --help` is a command used in Dart programming language to display help information about the ''dart:fix'' package''s ''fix'' sub-command. This command attempts to automatically fix reported issues in Dart code using integrated lint rules and quick-fixes provided by the editor or IDE. Running `dart fix --help` provides details on available options such as specifying a file or directory, running in batch mode, or customizing the fix engine used.'
