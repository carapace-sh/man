documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `gh pr checks` command is used with the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) to retrieve the status of the automated checks for a particular pull request in a GitHub repository. It returns details about the checks, such as their names, status (e.g., success, failure, error), and the time they were initiated. This information can help developers understand if there are any issues preventing their pull request from being merged.'
    flag:
        fail-fast: '[AI] The `gh pr checks --fail-fast` command is a feature of GitHub''s Pull Request (PR) process using the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface). This option ensures that the PR builds and passes all checks before merging or commenting on the PR. If any check fails, the process will immediately stop and fail without continuing to run subsequent checks, allowing developers to address the issue promptly. This behavior can help prevent potentially problematic code changes from being merged inadvertently.'
        interval: '[AI] `gh pr checks --interval` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to manage and monitor checks for a pull request (PR). This command sets up or updates an interval at which GitHub checks the PR for actions, such as workflow runs, statuses, and static analysis. The interval argument specifies how often in minutes the checks should be performed. For example, `gh pr checks --interval 10` sets the check interval to every 10 minutes.'
        required: '[AI] `gh pr checks --required` is a GitHub command used in the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) to require status checks to pass before a pull request can be merged. When this option is set for a branch or repository, GitHub will run all specified checks when a pull request is opened and the merge button will only become available if all checks have passed. This helps ensure code quality, security, and compliance before merging changes into the main branch.'
        watch: '[AI] `gh pr checks --watch` is a GitHub CLI command used to monitor the status of continuous integration (CI) checks for a specific GitHub pull request (PR). The `--watch` flag keeps the output updated in real-time as new check runs are triggered. It helps developers stay informed about the progress and status of their PR checks, enabling them to address any issues promptly.'
        web: '[AI] `gh pr checks --web` is a command used with GitHub''s Git Hub Action (GHA) and the Git Hub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. It is used to check the status of workflow runs, specifically those related to pull request checks. With `--web`, you can view the progress and results of these checks on GitHub''s web interface in real time. This command does not trigger any actions; it only allows you to monitor them externally.'
