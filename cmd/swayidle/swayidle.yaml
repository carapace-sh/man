documentation:
    command: '[AI] `swayidle` is a command-line utility for Sway WM (Window Manager), which enables power saving features by automatically suspending or hibernating the system when it''s idle. It uses various sensors, such as mouse and keyboard inactivity or display off, to determine if the system is idle. Once idle, `swayidle` can be configured to perform actions like suspending the system, locking the screen, or even turning off the monitor completely to save power.'
    flag:
        C: '[AI] `swayidle` is a power management tool for Wayland compositors like Sway. The option `-C` sets it to "dim only" mode, which means that when the system is idle (no user input), the screen brightness will be gradually reduced to save power. Unlike other modes like "suspend," this mode keeps the system running and does not disrupt ongoing tasks.'
        S: '[AI] `swayidle` is a power management utility for the Wayland compositor Sway. The `-S` option stands for "suspend" mode, which means that when no user activity is detected for a configured period of time, the system will enter a low-power state to save energy. This can be useful for laptops or other portable devices to extend battery life. The suspension is usually achieved by putting the GPU into a power-saving state and suspending the Linux kernel.'
        d: '[AI] `swayidle` is a power management tool for the Wayland composite window manager Sway. The command `swayidle -d` stands for "disable idle" and is used to turn off the idle time functionality of swayidle. This means that the computer will not enter low-power modes based on user inactivity, which can help prevent unwanted system suspensions or screen locking.'
        h: '[AI] `swayidle` is a background daemon for Wayland compositors like Sway, which manages idle time and power saving settings. The command `swayidle -h` displays its help information, providing an overview of available commands, their usage, and options to configure the power management features of Sway with swayidle.'
        w: '[AI] `swayidle` is a power management tool for the Wayland compositor Sway. The command `swayidle -w` stands for "wait idle" and instructs Sway to enter low-power mode when the system has been idle for a specified period of time, with the "-w" flag indicating that this should be done without user interaction. This can help conserve energy by putting the display into a low-power state when not in use.'
