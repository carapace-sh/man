documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul acl policy delete` command is used to remove an Access Control List (ACL) policy from Consul, a Connect and Config Management tool. This command takes one required argument: the name or ID of the policy to be deleted. When executed successfully, it removes the specified policy from Consul''s ACL configuration. It''s important to note that deleting a policy may affect the access control of your Consul-managed services and infrastructure, so ensure that you have a clear understanding of the implications before running this command.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] `consul acl policy delete --ca-file` is a command used with the Consul Access Control List (ACL) tool to delete an ACL policy. The `--ca-file` flag specifies the path to a CA file for verifying the TLS certificate presented by the Consul server during communication. It ensures secure and encrypted communication between your client and the Consul server while performing the deletion operation.'
        ca-path: '[AI] The `consul acl policy delete --ca-path` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) policy from Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool. The `--ca-path` option specifies the path to a CA (Certificate Authority) certificate file when using SSL/TLS for secure communication with the Consul server. This option ensures that the request to delete the policy is authenticated and encrypted before being processed by the server.'
        client-cert: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl policy delete --client-cert` command is used in the Consul Access Control List (ACL) system to delete an existing ACL policy with a specific client certificate. Consul is a popular service discovery, configuration, and orchestration tool.

            The `consul` CLI (Command Line Interface) command `acl policy delete` deletes an ACL policy defined in Consul. The `--client-cert` flag specifies the client certificate of the entity that is authorized to perform this action. It ensures that only clients with the specified certificate can issue the delete command, adding a layer of security and access control to Consul's configuration.
        client-key: |-
            [AI] `consul acl policy delete --client-key` is a command used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command is part of the Access Control List (ACL) subsystem, which helps manage secure access to resources within Consul.

            The `delete` action specifies that an existing ACL policy should be removed. The `--client-key` flag is used to identify the client making the request, which must have sufficient permissions to delete policies. The client key is a unique identifier assigned to each Consul client when it registers with the server. By including this flag, the command ensures that only authorized clients can issue the `delete` action for specific policies.
        datacenter: '[AI] The `consul acl policy delete --datacenter` command is used in Hashicorp Consul to remove an Access Control List (ACL) policy from a specific datacenter in a Consul cluster. This command removes the specified ACL policy from the given datacenter''s policy tree, effectively revoking access control granted by that policy. The `--datacenter` flag is used to specify which datacenter the policy resides in within the Consul cluster.'
        http-addr: '[AI] The `consul acl policy delete --http-addr` command is used in Hashicorp Consul to remove an Access Control List (ACL) policy that permits access to the Consul HTTP API at a specific address. The `--http-addr` option specifies the IP address and port number of the Consul HTTP API server to which the policy applies. By deleting an ACL policy, you revoke the associated permissions for the principal (user or role) that was granted those permissions by the policy. This command is useful in managing access control to your Consul configuration and data.'
        id: '[AI] The `consul acl policy delete` command is used to remove an Access Control List (ACL) policy from Consul, which is a connectivity and configuration management tool. The `--id` flag specifies the unique identifier of the policy to be deleted. This command grants administrators the ability to manage ACL policies programmatically for securing access to services and data in Consul.'
        name: '[AI] The `consul acl policy delete` command is used to remove an Access Control List (ACL) policy from Consul, which is an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. The `--name` flag specifies the name of the policy to be deleted. When executed, Consul removes the specified policy from its ACL management tree, revoking any associated permissions.'
        namespace: '[AI] The `consul acl policy delete` command is used to remove an Access Control List (ACL) policy in Consul, a Connectivity and Orchestration tool. This command specifically refers to the deletion of policies in a given Kubernetes namespace. When you include the `--namespace` argument, Consul will only delete ACL policies that have been applied to the specified Kubernetes namespace.'
        stale: '[AI] `consul acl policy delete --stale` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, an infrastructure coordination platform. This command is utilized to delete stale Access Control List (ACL) policies in the Consul system. ACL policies that are no longer in use or have become outdated due to changes in resources or permissions are considered "stale." By running this command, you can remove these unnecessary policies and maintain a clean and efficient policy structure within your Consul environment.'
        tls-server-name: '[AI] The `consul acl policy delete --tls-server-name` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) policy from Hashicorp Consul''s Key Value Store or HTTP API, specifically for policies that use TLS server certificates with a specified name. When you run this command, you provide the name of the policy to be deleted as an argument. The `--tls-server-name` option specifies the name of the TLS server certificate used by Consul''s ACL service to secure communication between clients and the server. By deleting a policy using this command, you are effectively revoking access granted under that policy.'
        token: '[AI] The `consul acl policy delete --token` command is used to remove an Access Control List (ACL) policy from Consul, a popular service discovery and configuration management tool. The `--token` argument specifies the token with sufficient permissions to perform the policy deletion operation. This command is typically used when it''s necessary to revoke access or change security configurations within the Consul environment.'
        token-file: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl policy delete` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) policy from Hashicorp Consul, a service discovery, configuration, and orchestration tool. The `--token-file` flag specifies the path to a file containing a valid Consul token. This token is required for authentication and authorization purposes when performing administrative tasks, such as deleting an ACL policy. The command syntax would look like:

            ```bash
            consul acl policy delete POLICY_ID --token-file TOKEN_FILE_PATH
            ```

            Replace `POLICY_ID` with the unique identifier of the policy you wish to delete and `TOKEN_FILE_PATH` with the path to the token file.
