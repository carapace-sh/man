documentation:
    command: '[AI] `yarn plugin import` is a Yarn 2 command used to install and import plugins directly into a Yarn workspace as first-class citizens. Unlike npm scripts, Yarn workspaces can treat plugins like regular packages by adding them to the `package.json` file under `devDependencies` or `peerDependencies`. This command automates that process by fetching the plugin and its dependencies, then updating the `package.json` accordingly.'
