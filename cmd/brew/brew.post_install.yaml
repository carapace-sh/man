    command: '[AI] `brew post_install` is a hook script run by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, after successfully installing a new package or formula. It provides an opportunity to perform custom tasks or configurations specific to the installed package, such as setting up symlinks, creating configuration files, or installing additional dependencies. This hook script is typically located in the `post-install` subdirectory of the Homebrew formula''s directory.'
    flag:
        debug: |-
            [AI] `brew post_install --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. When you install a new package or formula using Homebrew, it may include a `post_install` script. This script runs automatically after the installation process to perform additional tasks or configurations related to the installed software.

            The `--debug` flag is optional and enables more detailed output from Homebrew during the execution of the `post_install` script. It helps in troubleshooting and understanding the flow of the command, making it easier to identify issues that may occur during installation.

            For instance, when you run `brew install somepackage --debug`, it will execute the `somepackage` formula and display debug information for the `post_install` script, which might include variables' values, error messages, or other helpful details.
        help: |-
            [AI] `brew post_install` is a command provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux. The `post_install` script is run automatically after a new Homebrew package is installed or upgraded.

            The `--help` option is used to display detailed information about how to use the `brew post_install` command with various arguments and options. It provides users with instructions on how to customize the behavior of the post-installation scripts for specific packages, as well as troubleshooting suggestions if issues arise during this process.

            Here's an example output when using the `--help` option:

            ```sh
            Usage: postinstall [Formula...]

            Run post-install scripts for the given Homebrew formulae. By default, only installed
            formulae will be processed. Use --reinstall to also process formulae that have
            been upgraded but not yet reinstalled.

            Options:
              --help                          Show this message and exit.
              --verbose                       Run command with greater output.
              --quiet                         Suppress progress output; only critical messages
                                             are printed.
              --debug                         Enable debug logging.
              --reinstall                     Reinstall the formulae after running their post-install
                                             scripts, which can be useful for packages that modify
                                             files in place or perform other actions that need to be
                                             repeated.
            ```
        quiet: '[AI] `brew post_install --quiet` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `post_install` part refers to a script that gets executed after a Homebrew package is installed. The `--quiet` flag means that the output of the installation process will be suppressed, making it run more silently. So, this command runs the `post_install` script of the installed package without displaying any messages or progress indicators.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew post_install` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is typically used by developers to run custom scripts after a Homebrew package has been installed. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output produced during the installation process, providing more detailed information about what is happening at each step. So, when you use `brew post_install --verbose`, it runs the post-installation script with increased verbosity.'
