documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "firefox" command is used to open the Mozilla Firefox web browser from the terminal or command line interface in various operating systems, such as Linux and macOS. When you type and execute this command, it launches the Firefox application, allowing you to browse the internet using its features and functionalities.'
    flag:
        P: '[AI] The `-P` option in Firefox is used to specify a profile to use when launching the browser. A Firefox profile is a collection of settings, bookmarks, and other data that determines how the browser looks and behaves for a given user. By using `-P` followed by the name or path of a specific profile, you can open Firefox with that profile''s data instead of the default one. This can be useful when you have multiple users or use cases on a single machine and want to keep their data separate.'
        ProfileManager: '[AI] The `--ProfileManager` command-line option for Firefox opens the Profile Manager, which is a utility that allows managing multiple Firefox profiles from the terminal or command prompt. It enables creating new profiles, deleting existing ones, and switching between different profiles without needing to log in and out each time. This feature can be useful for testing different configurations, maintaining separate browser sessions, or providing multiple users with their own personalized browsing experiences on a single Firefox installation.'
        allow-downgrade: '[AI] The `--allow-downgrade` flag in Firefox is used to override the default security setting that prevents installing or running add-ons, themes, and extensions with known security vulnerabilities or lower version compatibility than what''s currently installed. By using this flag, users can manually allow the installation of potentially risky software. It should be noted that using `--allow-downgrade` increases the security risk for your Firefox browser and may expose it to various threats. Therefore, it is recommended to use this flag only when necessary and with caution.'
        browser: '[AI] The command `"firefox --browser"` is used in the context of the Firefox web browser to launch it with a specific profile or custom user settings. The `--browser` option tells Firefox to use a custom profile directory, specified in the environment variable `MOZ_PROFILE_DIR`, instead of the default one. This can be useful for testing different configurations or keeping work and personal data separate.'
        devtools: '[AI] The `--devtools` flag for Firefox is used to open the Developer Tools window when starting a new browser session. It''s typically invoked from the command line when launching Firefox in headless mode or automating tests, allowing users to inspect and modify web pages, debug JavaScript code, and analyze network traffic without requiring user interaction with the graphical user interface.'
        display: '[AI] The `--display` option in Firefox is used to specify which X Window System display or Wayland composite window manager to use when running Firefox as a standalone application on Linux systems. It takes an argument that represents the name or ID of the desired display, ensuring Firefox opens on the correct screen and not causing confusion with multiple displays. This option helps in managing Firefox windows across multiple monitors and provides a better user experience by allowing users to navigate and interact with web content efficiently.'
        first-startup: '[AI] The `--first-startup` flag is a command-line option for Mozilla Firefox web browser. It is used during the first run of a fresh Firefox profile to display a wizard that helps users configure their settings, such as language preference, privacy options, and default homepage. This flag ensures that the first-time user experience (FTEU) is displayed even if the user has suppressed it with other preferences. It''s important to note that using this flag will override any existing preferences and customizations in the profile.'
        full-version: '[AI] The `--full-version` command-line argument for Firefox is used to display the full version information of the installed Firefox browser, including the version number, build identifier, and compilation timestamp. It provides detailed and precise information about the specific version of Firefox being run, which can be helpful for troubleshooting, compatibility checks, or other purposes.'
        headless: '[AI] `--headless` is a command-line argument for the Firefox web browser. It runs the browser in headless mode, which means that it starts up without a graphical user interface (GUI). This can be useful for automated testing, data scraping, or other tasks where manual interaction with the browser isn''t necessary. Instead of rendering a GUI, Firefox will focus on processing web content and executing JavaScript code efficiently. The output from such headless browsing tasks are usually handled through command-line interfaces or APIs rather than a visible browser window.'
        help: '[AI] `firefox --help` is a command used in the Terminal or Command Prompt to display help information about the Firefox web browser when run with this argument. It provides an overview of various command-line options that can be used to customize the browsing experience, such as opening specific URLs, enabling or disabling add-ons, setting profiles, and more. The detailed list and descriptions are displayed in the console, allowing users to quickly understand how to use Firefox from the command line for various purposes.'
        jsconsole: '[AI] The `--jsconsole` flag is a command-line option for the Firefox web browser that enables the JavaScript Console. This console provides a way to interactively test and debug JavaScript code in the context of a web page loaded in Firefox. It allows users to execute JavaScript commands, inspect variables, monitor errors, and observe DOM modifications in real time, making it an essential tool for web developers and power users.'
        migration: '[AI] The `--migration` command-line option in Firefox is used to perform a data migration between two profiles. When you run Firefox with this option, it will compare and merge the data from two specified profiles into a new or existing profile. This is particularly useful when migrating bookmarks, saved passwords, or other settings from one Firefox profile to another. Note that this command does not start the Firefox browser itself but only performs the migration process.'
        new-instance: '[AI] The command `firefox --new-instance` is used to open a new instance of the Firefox web browser with an empty profile and new session, meaning no previously opened tabs or windows will be restored. This can be useful when you want to start Firefox with a clean slate for security reasons or to avoid cluttering your current browsing session.'
        new-tab: '[AI] The command `firefox --new-tab` is used to open a new tab in the Firefox web browser through the terminal or command prompt. This command is typically used in Unix-based systems like Linux, but can also be applied in Windows using a compatible terminal emulator. When executed, this command launches Firefox and immediately opens a new tab without displaying a window or requiring user interaction to do so. It''s useful for automation scripts or when you want to open a link in a background tab.'
        no-remote: '[AI] The `--no-remote` flag in Firefox is used to open a new instance of Firefox browser with independent profiles and processes, rather than opening a new tab or window within an existing Firefox session. This can be useful for testing different configurations, running automated tests, or ensuring privacy and isolation between browsing activities.'
        preferences: '[AI] `firefox --preferences` is a command-line option for the Firefox web browser that opens the Preferences dialog or creates a new profile if run with no existing Firefox window open. It allows users to modify various browser settings directly from the command line without having to use the graphical user interface. These preferences can include things like home page, privacy settings, and user agent string.'
        profile: '[AI] The `--profile` option in Firefox is used to specify which profile to use when launching the browser. A Firefox profile contains user-specific data such as bookmarks, saved passwords, and customized settings. By default, Firefox uses the system default profile or creates a new one if it doesn''t exist. Using `--profile` allows you to open Firefox with a specific profile, which can be useful for testing different configurations or keeping separate sets of data for multiple users. The argument to `--profile` is the path to the profile directory.'
        safe-mode: '[AI] `--safe-mode` is a command-line argument for the Firefox browser. It starts Firefox in a diagnostic state, disabling extensions and resetting various preferences to their defaults. This can help troubleshoot issues with the browser or specific add-ons.'
        search: '[AI] The `--search` flag is a command-line option for the Firefox web browser. When used, it opens a new tab with the default search engine and performs a search using the given query as the search term. For example, `firefox --search "kitten videos"` would open Firefox, go to a new tab, and perform a search for "kitten videos" using the default search engine. This can be useful for quickly performing a search from the command line or from a script.'
        ssb: '[AI] `--ssb` is a command-line option for Mozilla Firefox. It stands for "Single Session Browser," which means it opens Firefox using a new profile with no previous browsing or save data. This can be useful for private or temporary browsing, as no history or cookies will be retained after the session is closed.'
        start-debugger-server: '[AI] The `--start-debugger-server` flag is a command-line option for the Firefox web browser. When this flag is used, Firefox starts up with its built-in debugger server enabled. This allows developers to connect to Firefox using remote debugging tools like the WebDriver protocol or the JavaScript Debugger in Visual Studio Code, for example, to inspect and modify running code in real time. It''s useful for diagnosing complex issues, optimizing performance, and understanding browser behavior during development.'
        sync: '[AI] The `--sync` command-line option in Firefox is used for Sync functionality. It allows users to synchronize their browser settings, bookmarks, history, open tabs, and other data across multiple devices. When you use this option with the Firefox profile directory or the Firefox Portable installation, it initiates the Sync service, which then establishes a connection to the Firefox Accounts servers to begin the synchronization process. This ensures that your browser data stays in sync across different devices.'
        version: '[AI] The `--version` command is an option used with the Firefox web browser to display its current version number. When you open a terminal or command prompt and type `firefox --version`, Firefox returns the version number in the format "Major.Minor.SecurityUpdate". For example, "91.0.1". This information helps users ensure they have the latest security updates and can troubleshoot issues related to specific browser versions.'
