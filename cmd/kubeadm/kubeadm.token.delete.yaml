        [AI] `kubeadm token delete` is a command used to remove an existing token in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. When you create a new cluster or join a node to an existing one, Kubeadm generates a set of tokens for various purposes like bootstrapping and client authentication.

        This command deletes a specific token by its name or UID. Once deleted, the corresponding client or joining node can no longer use that token to authenticate and interact with the cluster. It is typically used when you want to revoke access for a particular service account or node.
