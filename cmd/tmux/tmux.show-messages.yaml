    command: '[AI] `tmux show-messages` is a TMUX command used to display the messages in the TMUX status bar or the system tray (if using a graphical terminal). This command can be followed by the message type as an argument, such as "error", "warning", or "info". When no argument is provided, it shows all types of messages. The default behavior is to display only new messages. To clear the messages after displaying, use `tmux show-messages -C` or `tmux show-messages -q`.'
    flag:
        J: '[AI] `tmux show-messages -J` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer that displays all system and application messages in the terminal pane where the Tmux session is running. The `-J` flag stands for "join" multiple messages into a single line before displaying them, making the output more compact and easier to read when there are many messages.'
        T: '[AI] The `tmux show-messages -T` command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, displays the last message or error that occurred in the session or pane without clearing it. The `-T` option is used to display the message as text on the screen rather than echoing it to the terminal output. This can be useful for debugging or tracking errors within TMUX sessions.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux show-messages` command with the `-t` option is used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to display the messages in the status bar of the specified window or pane. The `-t` flag followed by the target window ID or pane number is provided as an argument to indicate which window or pane''s messages should be displayed. This command helps users keep track of notifications and messages generated within Tmux sessions without having to constantly check the logs.'
