    --apiserver-advertise-address=: The IP address the API Server will advertise it's listening on. If not set the default network interface will be used.
    --apiserver-bind-port=: Port for the API Server to bind to.
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --control-plane-endpoint=: Specify a stable IP address or DNS name for the control plane.
    --image-repository=: Choose a container registry to pull control plane images from
    --kubeconfig=: The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster. If the flag is not set, a set of standard locations can be searched for an existing kubeconfig file.
    --kubernetes-version=: Choose a specific Kubernetes version for the control plane.
    --pod-network-cidr=: Specify range of IP addresses for the pod network. If set, the control plane will automatically allocate CIDRs for every node.

    command: |-
        [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase addon kube-proxy` argument specifies that you want to install and configure the `kube-proxy` addon.

        `kube-proxy` is a network proxy that runs in each node of the cluster. It automatically creates, configures, and updates iptables rules based on the pod labels and service selectors. This allows services in the cluster to be exposed on nodes' IP addresses without requiring manual configuration.

        So, `kubeadm init phase addon kube-proxy` command initializes a Kubernetes cluster with the `kube-proxy` addon installed and configured.
    flag:
        apiserver-advertise-address: '[AI] The command `kubeadm init phase addon kube-proxy --apiserver-advertise-address` is used to install and configure the Kubernetes proxy component, kube-proxy, during the initialization of a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. The `--apiserver-advertise-address` flag specifies the IP address that the Kubernetes API server should advertise to other components in the cluster. This is necessary so that nodes in the cluster can communicate with the API server using this IP address, and kube-proxy needs this information to properly route traffic between pods and services within the cluster.'
        apiserver-bind-port: |-
            [AI] The command `kubeadm init phase addon kube-proxy --apiserver-bind-port` is used to install and configure the Kubernetes proxy addon named `kube-proxy` during the initialization of a new Kubernetes cluster managed by `kubeadm`.

            The `--apiserver-bind-port` flag specifies the port number on which the Kubernetes API server is listening for incoming connections. This information is required by the `kube-proxy` addon to communicate with the API server and perform its functions, such as proxying traffic between nodes in the cluster and enforcing network policies.

            In summary, this command installs the `kube-proxy` addon and passes it the API server's port number for communication.
        config: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool for initializing Kubernetes clusters. The `phase addon kube-proxy --config` option is used to install and configure the `kube-proxy` addon during the initialization process.

            `kube-proxy` is a network proxy component that automatically creates, configures, and manages iptables rules for Kubernetes services based on their declarative configuration. By running `kubeadm init phase addon kube-proxy --config`, you are instructing `kubeadm` to install the `kube-proxy` addon using the default configuration provided by Kubernetes, rather than using a custom configuration file. This ensures that the `kube-proxy` is installed and configured correctly for your cluster.
        control-plane-endpoint: |-
            [AI] The `kubeadm init` command is used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase addon kube-proxy --control-plane-endpoint` option is used to install and configure the `kube-proxy` addon for this cluster.

            `kube-proxy` is a network proxy component that automatically directs network traffic to the appropriate pod based on Kubernetes label selectors. It maintains the service endpoints and proxies the traffic accordingly, ensuring communication between services and their clients.

            By adding `--control-plane-endpoint`, you are specifying the endpoint for the control plane components in your cluster (such as etcd and the API server). This information is required so that `kube-proxy` can properly route traffic to these components and ensure they are accessible from nodes within the cluster.
        image-repository: |-
            [AI] The `kubeadm init` command is used to bootstrap a new Kubernetes cluster. The option `--addon kube-proxy` enables and installs the `kube-proxy` addon during initialization.

            The `--image-repository` flag specifies the Docker registry from which to pull the `kube-proxy` image used by this addon. For example, `--image-repository=quay.io/kubernetes-sigs` refers to the official Kubernetes SIGs repository, where you can find the latest stable version of `kube-proxy`. This flag is optional and defaults to `gcr.io/google-containers` for the Google-maintained kube-proxy image if no value is provided.
        kubeconfig: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `addon kube-proxy` is an optional feature that can be enabled during the initialization phase. This adds and configures the Kubernetes proxy component, which is responsible for routing traffic between the external world and the pods running in the cluster.

            The `--kubeconfig` flag specifies the output file where to save the kubeconfig information, which is necessary for managing the cluster using tools like `kubectl`. With this command:

            ```bash
            kubeadm init phase addon kube-proxy --kubeconfig <filename>
            ```

            You are initializing the Kubernetes cluster and adding the kube-proxy addon, saving the generated kubeconfig information in the specified file. This allows you to manage your cluster using `kubectl` with the given configuration file.
        kubernetes-version: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase addon kube-proxy` specifies that you want to install the `kube-proxy` addon during this process. The `--kubernetes-version` flag indicates which specific version of Kubernetes you want to use for your cluster. In summary, this command initializes a new Kubernetes cluster and installs the `kube-proxy` addon with the specified Kubernetes version.'
        pod-network-cidr: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm`, which is a tool for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters. The `phase addon kube-proxy --pod-network-cidr` option in this command configures the installation of the `kube-proxy` addon, which is a network proxy component that works with the Kubernetes API to route traffic between pods in a cluster. The `--pod-network-cidr` flag sets the CIDR block for assigning IP addresses to the pods in the cluster using an external pod networking solution, if used. This ensures proper network communication among pods within the cluster.'
