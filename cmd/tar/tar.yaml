    command: |-
        [AI] `tar` is a utility used in Unix-based systems for creating and extracting archives or packages from files. The name `tar` stands for "tape archive," reflecting its historical use to write data to magnetic tapes.

        Tar archives combine multiple files into a single archive file, often accompanied by compression using gzip or bzip2. This makes transferring, storing, and managing large collections of files more convenient. The basic syntax for creating an archive is:

        ```
        tar cvf <archive_name>.tar <files_or_directories_to_include>
        ```

        To extract the contents of a tar archive, use:

        ```
        tar xvf <archive_name>.tar
        ```

        Additional options like `z`, `j`, and others can be used for compression and decompression with gzip or bzip2. Tar also supports creating and extracting directories as part of the archive structure, maintaining the original directory tree relationships when restoring the files.
    flag:
        absolute-names: '[AI] The `--absolute-names` option in the `tar` command is used to restore or extract files from a tar archive with their absolute paths instead of relative ones. This means that when extracting files, the output will be placed in the specified extraction directory with their original file paths preserved. This can be useful when dealing with complex file structures or when moving the extracted files to another location.'
        acls: '[AI] `tar --acls` is a command used with the `tar` utility in Unix-based systems for creating or extracting tar archives, with the added functionality of preserving Access Control Lists (ACLs) and other file attributes during the archiving and extraction process. ACLs define specific access permissions for different user groups or individual users on a file or directory beyond the standard read, write, execute permissions. By using `--acls`, you ensure that these more complex access permissions are maintained when dealing with tarred files.'
        add-file: '[AI] The `tar --add-file` command is a utility in the Tar archiving format used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. This option is used to add individual files to an existing tar archive without creating a new one. The syntax is: `tar -rf <archive>.tar <file_to_be_added>`. When you run this command, tar reads the named archive and writes the specified file to it. The `-r` flag tells tar to append new members to the archive and the `-f` flag indicates that the named archive file is an input or output argument.'
        after-date: '[AI] The `--after-date` option in the `tar` command is used to include only files that have been modified after a specified date. This can be useful for creating tar archives of newly created or updated files. The date can be provided in various formats, such as "YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYYMMDD". For example, `tar cvf archive.tar --after-date="2022-01-01"` would create an archive containing only files modified on or after January 1, 2022.'
        anchored: '[AI] The `--anchored` option in the `tar` command is used to keep pathname components within archived directories relative to that directory, instead of relative to the working directory during extraction. This means that when extracting an archive with `--anchored`, each subdirectory will be extracted as a separate entity, preserving the original file hierarchy. Without `--anchored`, subdirectories would be extracted as if they were located in the current working directory during extraction.'
        append: '[AI] The `--append` option used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems is used to modify an existing tar archive instead of creating a new one. When this option is specified, the new data will be appended to the end of the existing archive without overwriting it. This can be useful when you want to add new files to an archive without replacing any existing ones.'
        atime-preserve: '[AI] The `--atime-preserve` option in the `tar` command is used to preserve the access time of files when they are being archived and restored. Access time refers to the last time a file was accessed or read by any process, including the user or other applications. By default, `tar` does not preserve access times during the archive and restore process. Using this option ensures that the original access times are maintained, which can be important in some use cases, such as backups or version control systems.'
        auto-compress: '[AI] The `--auto-compress` option in the `tar` command compresses files automatically while creating or appending to a tar archive. It uses the most effective compression method available based on the file type (gzip for regular files, bz2 for binary files, etc.). This flag helps reduce the size of the output archive and makes it easier to transfer or store large data sets.'
        backup: '[AI] `tar --backup` is a command in the `tar` utility in Unix-like operating systems for creating or extracting archives. The `--backup` option ensures that files with the same name as those in the archive are backed up before extraction, by appending a tilde (~) character and a version number to the original file names. This is useful for preventing data loss when overwriting existing files during extraction.'
        block-number: '[AI] The `--block-number` option is a flag used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems for creating or extracting tar archives. This option specifies the number of data blocks each file should occupy in the archive. By default, `tar` determines the optimal block size based on the file''s content. However, using this flag allows explicit control over how many blocks a file should have. For example, you might use it to create or extract an archive with a specific block size for better compression or efficiency in certain situations.'
        blocking-factor: '[AI] The `--blocking-factor` option in the `tar` command is used to specify the number of data blocks that should be written to a single file in the output archive. This option can improve the performance of the `tar` command by reducing the number of write system calls made during the archiving process, as well as making the output file size more evenly distributed. A common value for `--blocking-factor` is 64KB (or 0x20000 in decimal), but it can be set to any value depending on the specific use case and available system resources.'
        bzip2: |-
            [AI] The `tar --bzip2` command is a combination of two utilities, `tar` and `gzip`, in Linux or Unix environments for archiving files with the compression method `bzip2`.

            The `tar` command is used to create, extract, and manipulate archive files. With the `--` option, any following arguments are treated as options for the next command. In this case, `--` separates the options for `tar` from those for `bzip2`.

            `bzip2`, which is combined with `tar` using the `--bzip2` option, is a lossless data compression algorithm used for archiving files. It offers better compression than gzip in certain cases but takes longer to compress and decompress files. This results in larger archive files that take up less disk space once compressed.

            So, the `tar --bzip2` command creates or extracts an archive with the `.tar.bz2` extension (also called a "tarball with bzip2 compression"), where both `tar` and `bzip2` are applied to the archive file.
        catenate: '[AI] The `tar --catenate` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems, specifically `tar` (Tape Archive), used for creating and extracting archives from a single or multiple files into one large output file. The `--catenate` option causes `tar` to concatenate extracted files into the output file instead of writing each file individually. This is useful when dealing with text files, as it allows for easy merging or processing of the entire archive as a whole.'
        check-device: '[AI] The `--check-device` option in the `tar` command is used to verify that the device or file specified for the archive exists and is accessible before extracting or creating an archive. This can help prevent errors due to invalid devices or files, particularly when working with large archives or remote sources. When this option is used, `tar` will display a message indicating whether the device or file is valid before proceeding with the archive operation.'
        check-links: |-
            [AI] The `--check-links` option is a flag used with the `tar` (Tape Archive) utility in Unix-based systems for extracting archive files. It is primarily used to ensure the integrity of symbolic links within the archive during extraction.

            When this flag is specified, `tar` will follow all symbolic links in the archive and check if they still point to the correct target files in the extracted directory. If any link is found to be broken or pointing to an incorrect location, `tar` will report an error indicating the problematic link and its intended target.

            In summary, the `--check-links` flag helps maintain the consistency of symbolic links while extracting tar archives.
        checkpoint: '[AI] The `--checkpoint` option in the `tar` command is used during tar file creation or extraction with multi-volume or parallel processing. It allows saving and restoring the state of a running `tar` operation, enabling resumption from a failed or interrupted transfer. This can be particularly useful when dealing with large or incomplete data transfers over unreliable networks. The checkpoint information is saved to standard error output by default or can be redirected to a file for later use.'
        checkpoint-action: |-
            [AI] The `--checkpoint-action` option in the `tar` command is used to specify what action to take when a checkpoint (a saved state of the archive creation process) is reached. There are three possible values for this option:

            1. `none`: Tar will not create any checkpoints during the archiving process.
            2. `pause`: Tar will pause at each checkpoint, allowing you to inspect or modify the archive before it continues. This is useful when dealing with large archives or when you want more control over the archiving process.
            3. `resume`: Tar will resume an existing archive creation from the last checkpoint if the archive exists and is not complete. If no such checkpoint exists, tar will start a new archive from scratch. This option is useful when dealing with large archives that may be spread across multiple tapes or other storage media.
        clamp-mtime: '[AI] The `--clamp-mtime` option in the `tar` command is used to modify the modification time of files being extracted or written to a tar archive. By default, `tar` preserves the original file''s modification time during extraction. However, `--clamp-mtime` sets the extracted file''s modification time to the current one or to a specific time given as an argument (e.g., `--clamp-mtime="2021-10-01 12:34:56"`). This can be useful when dealing with files from different systems or archives with inconsistent timestamps, ensuring that the extracted files have consistent modification times on the target system.'
        compare: '[AI] `tar --compare` is a command in GNU Tar (short for Tape Archive), which is used to compare the differences between two archives or between an archive and a directory. The `--compare` option compares the contents of two tar files, showing the differences between them line-by-line. If used with a directory instead of an archive, it compares the contents of that directory against the corresponding archive. It helps in maintaining data consistency by identifying added, deleted or modified files.'
        compress: '[AI] The `tar --compress` command in Unix-based systems is used to create a tar archive with compression applied using gzip (gzip is the default compressor for tar). The "--compress" option activates this feature, resulting in a single tarball file that includes data compression. This helps reduce the size of the archive and saves storage space during transfer or backup.'
        concatenate: '[AI] The `--concatenate` option, also known as `-C`, is used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems for archiving files. When this flag is specified, tar will write the output of multiple files into a single file within the archive instead of creating separate files. This results in a single file being extracted when the archive is decompressed, making it easier to handle large numbers of small files.'
        confirmation: '[AI] The `--confirmation` flag in the `tar` command is used to require user confirmation before writing data to an archive. This option adds an extra layer of safety, as it forces the user to explicitly approve each write operation. When this flag is used, tar will prompt for confirmation before extracting or adding files to the archive.'
        create: '[AI] `tar --create` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems for creating or extracting archives using the Tar (Tape Archive) format. The `--create` option specifies that a new archive should be created, and the files and directories to be included are specified as arguments to the command. When run, it writes the archive data to a file with a `.tar` extension by default. It can also create gzipped or bzipped archives using options such as `--gzip` (`.tar.gz`) or `--bzip2` (`.tar.bz2`).'
        delay-directory-restore: '[AI] The `--delay-directory-restore` flag is an option for the `tar` command in Linux and other Unix-based systems. It is used when extracting archives to delay the restoration of directories until all files have been extracted. This can be useful in cases where the directory hierarchy may contain symbolic links or other complex structures, as restoring directories before all files are extracted could lead to errors or unexpected results. By delaying directory restoration until after all files have been extracted, `tar` ensures that the directory structure is reconstructed correctly and in its intended state.'
        delete: |-
            [AI] `tar --delete` is a command-line option used with the `tar` (tape archiving) utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. This option is also known as `--exclude-from` or `--file`.

            When used, `--delete` instructs `tar` to remove files from an archive that no longer exist in the working directory. The specified file containing the list of files to be excluded from deletion must be provided using the `--file` option. This can be useful when maintaining an archive of a changing file system and you want to keep it synchronized with the current state.
        dereference: '[AI] `tar --dereference` is a command-line option for the `tar` utility in Unix-based systems. When used, it tells `tar` to follow symbolic links and treat them as if they were the files or directories they reference during the archiving or extraction process. This means that instead of including the symbolic link itself in the archive or extracting a symbolic link from an archive, `tar` will handle the referenced file or directory directly.'
        diff: '[AI] `tar --diff` is a command in GNU Tar, which is a utility for creating and extracting archive files in tar format. The `--diff` option, also known as `--compare`, is used to compare the contents of two archives or directories. It shows the differences between the two by displaying the names of files that have been added, deleted, or modified in the second archive compared to the first one. This can be useful for identifying changes between two versions of a software or data set.'
        directory: |-
            [AI] The `--directory` option in the `tar` command is used to extract a tarball (an archive created using tar) into a specified directory instead of the current working directory. This can be useful when dealing with multiple archives or maintaining the file hierarchy during extraction. For instance, if you have an archive named "archive.tar" that contains a directory named "mydir", and you want to extract it to a directory called "extraction" in your home folder, you would use:

            ```bash
            tar xvf archive.tar --directory=./extraction/
            ```

            This command will extract the contents of the archive into the `mydir` directory within the `extraction` directory.
        exclude: '[AI] The `--exclude` option in the `tar` command is used to exclude specific files or directories from being archived during the tar operation. When you use this option, you specify one or more patterns that represent the files or directories to be excluded. These patterns can include file names, directory names, or globs (shell-style wildcards). The excluded files and directories will not be included in the resulting tar archive.'
        exclude-backups: '[AI] The `--exclude-backups` option is a flag used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems for creating or extracting archives. This flag is used to exclude files with backup suffixes, such as those ending with ".bak", ".old", or ".backup", from being processed during archive creation or extraction. It helps prevent accidental inclusion of unintended backup files and reduces the size of the archive.'
        exclude-caches: '[AI] The `--exclude-caches` option in the `tar` command is used to exclude files or directories with the ".cache" extension or containing the string "/.cache/" in their names from being archived during extraction or creation of a tar archive. This can help reduce the size of the archive and exclude unnecessary data, such as compiler cache files, that may not be required for the intended use of the extracted data.'
        exclude-caches-all: '[AI] The `--exclude-caches` option in the `tar` command is used to exclude files or directories with specific attributes (like caches, backups, etc.) from being archived during extraction. When using the `--exclude-caches-all` flag, tar excludes all files matching the pattern `.*[/][]/[.]*(~|.\ *)|/\.svn|\/.git(/{|/)/|/\.hg|/\.bzr` from being extracted or restored in the destination directory by default. This can help maintain the consistency and integrity of the extracted files, while also saving time and disk space by excluding unnecessary cache files.'
        exclude-caches-under: |-
            [AI] The `--exclude-caches-under` option is a flag used with the `tar` command in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems for creating or extracting archives. This option excludes directories and their subdirectories that are below (under) a specified directory from being included in the tar archive or being extracted, if they are recognized as caches based on their names.

            This flag can be useful when dealing with large projects, where temporary cache directories and other unnecessary files accumulate over time. By excluding these directories, you can keep your archives smaller and reduce clutter. The most common use cases include Git repositories (`.git` directory) or build artifacts (`node_modules`, `bower_components`, etc.).

            For example, when creating an archive with the command:

            ```bash
            tar czvf myarchive.tar.gz --exclude-caches-under=./path/to/cache/dir .
            ```

            It will exclude all directories and their subdirectories under `./path/to/cache/dir` from being included in the archive. Similarly, when extracting an archive with the command:

            ```bash
            tar xzf myarchive.tar.gz --exclude-caches-under=./path/to/cache/dir
            ```

            It will skip any directories or files under `./path/to/cache/dir` while extracting.
        exclude-from: '[AI] `tar --exclude-from` is an option used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems for archiving files. This option takes a file as an argument that lists patterns to exclude from the archive. For instance, if you have a file named "exclude.list" containing patterns like "*.log" or "dir1/", you can create an archive while excluding specific files or directories by using `tar czf archive.tar.gz --exclude-from=exclude.list <files_or_directories_to_be_archived>`. The specified patterns in the exclude file will not be included in the final archive.'
        exclude-ignore: '[AI] The `--exclude-ignore` option in the `tar` command is used to specify a list of patterns to exclude from the exclusion list defined by the `--exclude` or `--one-file-system` options. Essentially, it allows you to include certain patterns back into the extraction process after they have been excluded using other options. This can be useful in situations where you want to extract all files except for a specific set of files that match certain patterns, but then need to include some of those patterns back into the extraction.'
        exclude-ignore-recursive: '[AI] The `--exclude-ignore-recursive` option in the `tar` command is used to exclude specific files or directories from being archived, even if they match a pattern defined in the `.tar` or `.tgz` file''s exclusion list. This means that files or directories explicitly listed with `--exclude-ignore-recursive` will be excluded regardless of any exclusion rules set in the archive itself. It is useful when you want to override existing exclusion rules and include specific files or directories in the tarball.'
        exclude-tag: '[AI] The `--exclude-tag` option is a modifier used with the `tar` command in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems for creating or extracting tar archives. This option is used to exclude files or directories that match a given pattern from being processed by the tar command. The pattern is specified using the tag syntax, where the tag consists of a name enclosed within single quotes (`''...''`). For example, `--exclude-tag=''backup/''` would exclude any file or directory named ''backup'' and its contents when creating or extracting an archive. This can be useful for excluding large directories that are not needed for the intended use of the archive.'
        exclude-tag-all: '[AI] The `--exclude-tag-all` option in `tar`, a commonly used archiving utility, is used to exclude files or directories with specific tags or attributes from being archived. The tag "all" signifies that all available exclusion tags are applied. Commonly used exclusion tags include ".git", ".svn", and ".hg". Therefore, `tar --exclude-tag-all` will exclude any file or directory matched by the default set of exclusion tags. It''s important to note that this option is mainly useful when creating an archive from a source directory.'
        exclude-tag-under: '[AI] The `--exclude-tag-under` option is a modification flag used with the `tar` command in Linux and Unix systems for archiving files. This flag excludes directories with specific names from being included in the tar archive, but only if those directories are located under another explicitly mentioned directory. For instance, if you use `--exclude-tag-under=dir1/` while creating a tarball, directories named ''dir1'' and any subdirectories under it will be excluded from the archive. Directories with the same name outside of ''dir1'' will not be affected.'
        exclude-vcs: '[AI] The `--exclude-vcs` option is a flag used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems for creating or extracting tar archives. This flag instructs tar to exclude files or directories that match certain patterns from version control systems, such as .git or .svn, when operating on the archive. The primary goal is to prevent accidental committing or checking of large and unnecessary version control directories into the archive, which can save disk space and improve transfer efficiency.'
        exclude-vcs-ignores: '[AI] The `--exclude-vcs-ignores` option is a flag used with the `tar` command in version control systems, such as Git. It instructs `tar` to exclude files and directories that are ignored by the version control system''s .gitignore files when creating or extracting an archive. This helps ensure that unintentionally committed or extracted ignore files do not affect the content of the archive.'
        extract: '[AI] The `--extract` option in the `tar` command is used to extract files from a tar archive. When you use this option with `tar`, it will extract all the files from the archive to their original directories as they were in the archive. This is opposite to the `--extract-all` or `-x` option, which extracts all files from an archive to the current directory without preserving their original directory structure.'
        file: '[AI] The `--file` option in the `tar` command is used to specify a file name for the output of the tar archive. This option is typically used when creating an archive instead of appending data to an existing archive. When used with the `-cf` or `-xcf` flags (for create and extract with a gzipped archive respectively), it results in generating a new tarball with the given filename instead of adding to an existing one. For example, `tar -czf myarchive.tar.gz mydir/` creates a new compressed tar archive named "myarchive.tar.gz" from the contents of the directory "mydir".'
        files-from: '[AI] The `--files-from` option in the `tar` command is used to read a list of files or file names to be extracted or archived from a given file instead of specifying them individually on the command line. The specified file contains one file name per line. This can be particularly useful when dealing with large numbers of files or when automating the process using scripts.'
        force-local: '[AI] The `--force-local` option in the `tar` command is used when extracting files from a tar archive. It overwrites local files that have the same name and size as the files in the archive, even if they were modified more recently than the archived files. This can be useful when dealing with backups or ensuring that locally modified files match the originals exactly.'
        format: '[AI] The `--format` option in the `tar` command is used to customize the output format of the `tar` list (`-t`) or extract (`-x`) commands. It allows specifying a custom template for displaying file information, such as file name, permissions, ownership, size, and timestamps. This can be useful for automating tasks or analyzing archive contents in specific ways. The syntax is `--format=''template''`, where ''template'' is a string containing placeholders and formatting directives for the desired output.'
        full-time: '[AI] The `--full-time` option, when used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems, causes `tar` to write date-stamps using the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. This is different from the default behavior where no explicit time component is included, and only the date (MM-DD-YYYY) is written. This option is useful when dealing with multiple archives having the same filenames but different modification times, as it allows for better identification of the distinct files.'
        get: '[AI] The `tar --get` command is not a standard option for the `tar` utility in GNU or Unix-like operating systems. It seems there''s a misunderstanding, as `tar` does have the `--extract` (or `-x`) option which is used to extract files from an archive. The `--get` option does not exist. If you meant to ask about the `--extract` option, it is used to extract specific files from a tarball archive, while leaving other files and directories intact.'
        group: '[AI] The `--group` option is a flag used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems for archiving files. It modifies the extraction process by preserving the original file ownership and group membership during the extraction of tar archives. This means that when you extract a tar archive using the `--group` option, the extracted files will have the same group ownership as they had in the original archive. This flag can be useful when dealing with archives containing files that need to be restored with specific group permissions for correct file system functionality.'
        group-map: '[AI] The `--group-map` option in the `tar` command is used to specify a custom mapping of group numbers or names for files and directories during archive creation or extraction. It takes a newline-separated list of pairs, where each pair consists of a source group and a target group (or name). For example, `--group-map=1:5:2:6` maps group 1 to group 5 and group 2 to group 6. This option is helpful when dealing with file permissions preservation across different systems that use different group IDs or names.'
        gunzip: |-
            [AI] The `tar --gunzip` command is a combination of two common UNIX utilities: `tar` and `gzip`.

            The `tar` (Tape Archive) utility is used for creating, extracting, and managing archives or packages of files. It allows you to bundle multiple files into a single archive and compress it for efficient storage or transfer.

            The `gzip` (GNU Compress) utility is a data compression tool that uses the Lempel-Ziv coding algorithm with a sliding window and adaptive Huffman coding (LZ77). It compresses individual files, not archives, creating a file extension of .gz or .gzip.

            When using `tar --gunzip`, you are actually combining the process of extracting a tarball (using the `-x` or `-xf` option) and simultaneously decompressing any gzipped files within that tarball with the `--gzip` or `-z` flag. In summary, it extracts the tar archive while uncompressing the gzipped files inside it, resulting in having all the original files extracted to their intended directories.
        gzip: |-
            [AI] The `tar --gzip` command is a combination of two common Unix utilities: `tar` and `gzip`.

            `tar` is an archiving utility used to create, extract, or manipulate file archives. It can read and write various archive formats such as `tar.gz`, `tar.bz2`, etc.

            `--gzip` (or `-z`) is a flag passed to `tar`. When this option is used, `tar` compresses or expands the data in gzip format before or after archiving it. This results in smaller archive sizes and faster transfer times over networks due to compression.

            So, when you use `tar --gzip`, you are creating a compressed tarball (`.tar.gz`) file instead of an uncompressed one (`.tar`). It combines the actions of archiving files with gzip compression into a single command.
        hard-dereference: '[AI] The `--hard-dereference` flag is a option for the `tar` command in Unix-based systems. It tells `tar` to extract hard links as files with the same name and content instead of creating symbolic links or leaving the original hard link unchanged. This means that when you extract a tar archive using this option, each hard link in the archive will be converted into an equivalent file with the same contents. This can be useful in certain situations where maintaining the exact file structure and content is important.'
        help: '[AI] `tar --help` is a command used in Unix-based systems to display help information about the `tar` utility. When you run this command, tar will print out detailed usage instructions and a list of available options that can be used with it. This includes information on how to create, extract, or manipulate tar archives, as well as options for handling file permissions, ownerships, and symlinks. The help text also explains the format of tar archive files and provides examples of common usage scenarios.'
        hole-detection: '[AI] The `--holed-detection` flag in the `tar` command is used for checking and reporting archives with holes. A tar archive with holes has missing or incorrect data between valid parts. This flag enables Tarfile''s built-in hole detection when extracting or verifying an archive, providing information about any detected holes and helping ensure archive integrity.'
        ignore-case: '[AI] The `--ignore-case` option in the `tar` command is used to perform file extraction or creation operations in a case-insensitive manner. When this option is specified, tar will match filenames with disregard to the case of the letters in the names. This can be useful when working with filesystems that support case-insensitive naming, such as NTFS under Windows or certain Linux file systems in case-insensitive mode.'
        ignore-command-error: '[AI] The `--ignore-failed-read` and `--ignore-failed-write` options in the `tar` command with the suffix `--ignore-command-error` create a situation where tar will continue to compress or extract files even if it encounters an error while executing commands (such as chmod or chown) during the process. Instead of halting the operation, tar logs these errors and continues with the rest of the archive operations. This can be useful when dealing with large archives or scripts where minor errors in file permissions do not impact the overall success of the operation.'
        ignore-failed-read: '[AI] The `--ignore-failed-read` option is a flag used with the `tar` command in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It tells tar to continue extracting or archiving files even if an error occurs while reading from or writing to a specific file. If this flag is not set, tar will stop the process as soon as it encounters such an error. By ignoring failed reads, you can allow tar to continue processing other files in the archive, which may help you avoid the failure of the entire operation.'
        ignore-zeros: '[AI] The `--ignore-zeros` option in the `tar` command is used to skip processing files that have zero byte sizes. When this option is set, tar will not include such files during extraction or creation of the archive. This can be useful when dealing with empty or corrupted files.'
        incremental: '[AI] The `--incremental` option in the `tar` command is used to create or update an existing tar archive with only the files that have been modified since the last backup. This is also known as an incremental backup. When used with the `-c` (create) or `-u` (update) flags, this option allows for more efficient backups by reducing the amount of data that needs to be written to the archive, as only the changed files are added instead of the entire set of files every time.'
        index-file: '[AI] The `--index-file` option in the `tar` command is used to create or update a tar file index. An index file is a separate file that stores metadata about the files in a tar archive, allowing for faster access and random access to specific files within the archive. When you use the `--create` or `-c` option with `--index-file`, tar will create both the archive and the index file. If you only specify `--update` or `-u`, tar will update an existing archive and its corresponding index file. This can be useful for incrementally updating a large archive without having to restore the entire archive each time.'
        info-script: '[AI] `tar --info-script` is a command option used with the tar archiving utility in Unix-like operating systems. This option produces output that can be used as a script by other programs, describing each file as it is being extracted from the archive. The output includes file permissions, number of hard links, owner and group, size, and filename.'
        interactive: '[AI] The `--interactive` flag is an option for the `tar` command in Unix-based systems. It modifies the extraction or creation of tar archives to be interactive, meaning that the user will be prompted for confirmation before each file is extracted or overwritten. This can be useful when working with a large number of files to prevent accidental overwriting or extraction of unintended files.'
        keep-directory-symlink: '[AI] The `--keep-directory-symlink` flag is an option for the `tar` command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is used to preserve a directory symlink (a symbolic link pointing to a directory) during the extraction of a tar archive. By default, tar extracts symlinks as files with no special properties, but with this flag, the extracted symlink will remain functional and continue to point to its original target directory. This can be useful when dealing with directories that are linked between different parts of an archive or file system.'
        keep-newer-files: '[AI] The `--keep-newer-files` option in the `tar` command is used to preserve file modification time and only update output files if their source files are newer than the corresponding output files. This prevents unnecessary data overwriting during the extraction process, ensuring that previous changes to extracted files are preserved.'
        keep-old-files: '[AI] The `--keep-old-files` option in the `tar` command is used to preserve the original files that are being archived, even if those files are subsequently overwritten during the extraction process. This means that both the old and new versions of the files will exist after extracting the tarball.'
        label: '[AI] The `--label` option in the `tar` command is used to assign custom labels or tags to the extracted files or directories during the extraction process. It allows users to specify key-value pairs that will be stored as metadata within the tar archive, which can later be used for identification and organization purposes when working with large numbers of archives. This feature is particularly useful in automated workflows and scripting scenarios where maintaining consistent and descriptive labels is essential.'
        level: |-
            [AI] The `--level` option in the `tar` command specifies the extraction compression level for files during the tarball creation or modification. It can take three values:

            1. `-c` or `--create-empty-file`: Creating new empty files without data but with correct permissions and ownerships.
            2. `-a` or `--append`: Adding new files to an existing archive without overwriting existing data.
            3. Other values like `-j` (for gzip compression), `-J` (bz2), and `-Z` (compress): Extract files with a specific level of compression, such as gzip or bz2. The default is no compression.
        list: '[AI] The `tar --list` command is a utility used in Unix-like operating systems for creating and extracting tar archives. When used with the `--list` option, it simply lists the contents of an existing tar archive without extracting them. This can be useful for checking the contents of an archive before deciding to extract it or for obtaining a list of files that will be included when creating a new archive.'
        listed-incremental: '[AI] The `--listed-incremental` option with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems is used to create an incremental backup of files. It generates a tar archive listing only the files that have been modified since the last backup, specified by a previous archive or a given timestamp. This results in smaller backups than a full backup as it includes only the changes since the last backup.'
        lzip: |-
            [AI] The `tar --lzip` command is a combination of two utilities in Unix-like operating systems: `tar` and `lzip`.

            `tar` is an archiving utility used to create or extract files as tarfiles, which are collections of files and directories. It supports various options for filtering the data to be included or excluded from the archive.

            `lzip` is a lossless data compressor, often used with `tar` to create compressed archives with the `.tar.lz` file extension. When using the `--lzip` option with `tar`, it instructs `tar` to pass the output to `lzip` for compression instead of gzip by default. This results in better compression ratio compared to using gzip, but may take longer to compress due to lzip's more complex compression algorithm.
        lzma: |-
            [AI] The `tar --lzma` command is a combination of two utilities, `tar` and `gzip`.

            `tar` is an archiving utility used to create or extract files compressed in tar format. `--lzma` is a flag passed to `tar` that enables LZMA compression instead of the default gzip compression. LZMA stands for Lempel-Ziv-Markowitz-Abbreviated, which is a lossless data compression algorithm known for its high compression ratio and speed. So, `tar --lzma` creates or extracts tar archives with LZMA compression.
        lzop: '[AI] The `tar` command with the options `--lzop` creates a tar archive with compression using both `gzip` (p) and `lzop` (O) algorithms. This results in more efficient compression, particularly for larger files or data sets, as `lzop` is known to excel at compressing such files. The resulting archive file will have the `.tar.lzop` or `.tlz` extension.'
        mode: '[AI] The `--mode` option in the `tar` command is used to set or change the file permissions of files and directories during archiving or extraction. It takes a symbolic mode expression as its argument, following the standard Linux format `[ugoa]_[rwx]`. For example, `--mode=0755` sets the permission for all files in the archive to be readable, writable by the owner, and executable. The default behavior is not to change file permissions during archiving or extraction.'
        mtime: '[AI] The `tar` command with the option `--mtime` is used to extract files from a tar archive based on their modification time. When this option is specified, only files that have been modified since or before a given time will be extracted. The time can be specified using various formats such as absolute or relative time, or a specific date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. This can be useful for extracting only recently changed files from a backup archive or synchronizing files with a remote server.'
        multi-volume: '[AI] `tar --multi-volume` is a flag used with the `tar` command in Linux and other Unix-like systems to create or extract archives that are larger than the maximum file size limit. This flag allows creating or extracting multiple volumes of an archive, each with a separate filename suffix, making it possible to handle large data sets that cannot fit into a single archive file.'
        new-volume-script: '[AI] The `--new-volume-script` option in the `tar` command is used to specify a custom script for creating and managing volumes when using Tar files with the Linux Kernel''s `cattle` or `livestock` user-space tools, like LVM2 or Docker. This script is executed when a new volume is created or restored from the tar archive, allowing users to set up specific configurations or automate tasks related to their data volumes.'
        newer: '[AI] The `--newer` option in the `tar` command is used to include only files that have a newer modification time than those in a specified archive or a previously processed directory. This can be useful for creating an incremental backup, where only new or changed files are added to the archive. For example, `tar cfvz backup.tar --newer=*.bak my_directory/` will create a new archive named `backup.tar` containing only files in `my_directory/` that have been modified more recently than any file with the `.bak` extension in the current directory.'
        newer-mtime: '[AI] The `--newer-mtime` option in the `tar` command is used to include only files in an archive that have a newer modification time than those already existing in the destination directory when extracting, or when creating a new archive, only include files with a newer modification time than specified files. This can be useful for keeping backups up-to-date or for synchronizing file modifications between different systems.'
        no-acls: '[AI] The `tar --no-acls` command is used with the GNU `tar` utility in Linux and other Unix-based systems for creating or extracting tar archives. The `--no-acls` option disables the recording of Access Control Lists (ACLs) during the archive creation or restoration process. ACLs define more granular file permissions beyond the standard user, group, and others levels. By excluding them from the archiving process, all tar files created with this option will have default file permissions only. This can simplify file handling across different systems where default file permissions are consistent.'
        no-anchored: '[AI] The `--no-anchored` flag is an option used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems for creating or extracting tar archives. This flag instructs `tar` not to handle files with hard links as if they were separate files, but instead include the symbolic link itself and its target in the archive. With `--no-anchored`, when extracting, `tar` will create new hard links rather than copying the content of the linked file. This can be useful for preserving the original file structure when dealing with symlinks within a tar archive.'
        no-auto-compress: '[AI] The `tar` command with the `--no-auto-compress` option is used to create or extract tar archives without automatically compressing them using gzip or bz2. In other words, it allows you to create or extract tar archives as plain files without any compression. This can be useful when dealing with large files or specific use cases where compression is not desired.'
        no-check-device: '[AI] The `--no-check-device` option in the `tar` command is used to disable device file (character and block) check during the extraction process. This means that tar will not compare the major and minor numbers of devices in the archive with those on the system during extraction, allowing extraction even if there''s a mismatch between them. It can be useful when dealing with archives created on different systems or when extracting to a different environment. However, it may also lead to potential data loss or unexpected behavior if used carelessly.'
        no-delay-directory-restore: '[AI] The `--no-delay-directory-restore` flag is an option for the `tar` command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is used to prevent tar from restoring directories with empty names as if they were files, causing them to be overwritten during extraction instead. This can be useful when extracting archives that contain both files and empty directories with the same name, preventing unintended data loss.'
        no-ignore-case: '[AI] The `--no-ignore-case` option in the `tar` command is used to disable case sensitivity during file extraction or creation. By default, `tar` is case sensitive and will only match files with exact case as specified. With this option, it extracts or creates files regardless of their case differences. For example, if you have a tarball named "file.txt" in the system where file names are case sensitive, and you want to extract "File.txt" from that tarball using `tar --xvf` command with `--no-ignore-case`, it will successfully extract "File.txt" as "file.txt".'
        no-ignore-command-error: '[AI] The `--no-ignore-command-error` flag in `tar` is used to prevent tar from ignoring errors that occur when executing commands specified in the `TAR_FLAGS` or `CAT_FILES` options. By default, tar will continue extraction if it encounters an error while executing these commands, but with this flag set, tar will halt the extraction process and report each error separately. This can be useful when dealing with complex tar archives or when it''s important to maintain a strict level of control over the extraction process.'
        no-null: '[AI] The `--no-null` option in the `tar` command is used to prevent Tar from treating empty fields as null bytes when reading or writing data. This can be important when dealing with files that have special characters or non-printable characters, as null bytes can cause issues during file transfers or archiving processes. With `--no-null` enabled, the tar command ensures that these characters are treated as data rather than null bytes.'
        no-overwrite-dir: '[AI] The `--no-overwrite-dir` flag used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems is used to prevent tar from extracting files into an existing directory with the same name. This means that if a directory with the same name as an extracted directory already exists, tar will not overwrite it and instead will either fail or prompt for confirmation before proceeding. This flag helps avoid unwanted data loss or modification when extracting archives.'
        no-quote-chars: '[AI] The `--no-quote-chars` flag is a command-line option for the `tar` utility in Unix-like operating systems. It inhibits the quoting of special characters in filenames during tar extraction or creation. In other words, it prevents tar from interpreting certain characters as special, allowing filenames with spaces or other special characters to be processed correctly without needing to escape them explicitly. This can simplify usage when dealing with filenames that contain unusual characters.'
        no-recursion: '[AI] The `tar` command with the option `--no-recursion` or `-N` tells the tar archiver not to create recursive archives. In other words, it will only include files at the current level of the directory hierarchy and exclude subdirectories. This is useful when you want to archive specific files without their containing directories.'
        no-same-owner: '[AI] The `--no-same-owner` flag is used with the `tar` command in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It instructs `tar` not to preserve file ownership and permissions during the extraction process. By default, `tar` tries to restore the original file ownership and permissions when extracting archives. However, using the `--no-same-owner` flag prevents this behavior, allowing new files to be created with default user and group ownerships instead.'
        no-same-permissions: |-
            [AI] The `--no-same-permissions` flag is used with the `tar` command in Linux and other Unix-like systems. It modifies the default behavior of `tar` when extracting files from an archive.

            By default, `tar` preserves file permissions during extraction, meaning that the extracted files will have the same ownership and access permissions as the original files in the archive. However, when using the `--no-same-permissions` flag, `tar` does not preserve the file permissions during extraction. Instead, the extracted files will be given default ownership and permissions based on their content (i.e., executable binaries will have execute permissions, regular files will have read/write permissions for the owner, and read-only permissions for others). This flag can be useful when extracting files to a different file system or environment where the default permissions may not be suitable.
        no-seek: '[AI] The `--no-seek` option in the `tar` command is used to disable the seeking of files during extraction or creation of tar archives. This means that the archive will be processed sequentially, without jumping back and forth between files. It can improve the performance of the `tar` command when dealing with large files or archives, especially when reading from standard input or output to a file.'
        no-selinux: '[AI] `tar --no-selinux` is a command-line option for the tar utility in Linux systems. SELinux is a security module that enforces mandatory access control policies. The `--no-selinux` option disables SELinux context restoration during tar file creation or extraction. This means that files'' SELinux labels will not be preserved during the operation, resulting in no change to the targeted files'' SELinux contexts.'
        no-unquote: '[AI] The `--no-unquote` flag in GNU `tar` is used to prevent tar from interpreting special characters in filenames as part of the filename itself. Instead, tar treats these characters literally, enclosing the entire filename in quotes during extraction or creation of tar archives. By default, tar performs filename quoting automatically based on certain rules, but `--no-unquote` disables this behavior and leaves it to the user to ensure proper quoting if needed.'
        no-verbatim-files-from: '[AI] The `--no-verbatim-files-from` option in `tar` is used to prevent `tar` from treating input files as verbatim when extracting or creating an archive. This means that special characters and file permissions will be respected during the process instead of being ignored, which can be important for preserving the original state of the files. In essence, it ensures that the archive retains the same file attributes as the original files.'
        no-wildcards: '[AI] The `--no-wildcards` option in the `tar` command is used to prevent the extraction of files with wildcard characters (`*`, `?`, etc.) in their names from tarballs. With this option, tar will only extract files with exact matches to their names in the archive. It helps to avoid unexpected extraction of incorrect or multiple files during the extraction process.'
        no-wildcards-match-slash: '[AI] The `--no-wildcards-match-slash` option in the `tar` command is used to disable the matching of leading slashes (/) in wildcard patterns during the extraction process. By default, tar treats a leading slash as indicating a directory path and extracts accordingly. With this option disabled, only files with the specified pattern will be extracted, regardless of any leading directories. This can prevent unintended directory creation or extraction errors when using wildcards with tar.'
        no-xattrs: '[AI] The `tar` command with the option `--no-xattrs` is used to create or extract tar archives without preserving extended attributes (also known as file attributes). Extended attributes are data stored in addition to the regular file contents and metadata (like ownership, permissions, etc.). These attributes can include things like ACLs (Access Control Lists), timestamps, and user-defined keys with associated values. The `--no-xattrs` option is useful when you want to maintain consistency between different systems where extended attributes may or may not be supported, or when transferring files across systems without preserving unnecessary metadata.'
        "null": '[AI] The `--null` option in the `tar` command is used to handle fields with empty values or fields that should not be present in the archive as null-terminated strings, instead of empty spaces. This can be useful when dealing with specific data formats like CSV files where empty values are represented differently from missing fields. By using `--null`, tar will ensure that such data is correctly preserved during archival and extraction processes.'
        numeric-owner: '[AI] The `--numeric-owner` option is a flag used with the `tar` archiving utility in Unix-like operating systems. It instructs `tar` to restore file permissions and ownerships using numeric UIDs (User IDs) and GIDs (Group IDs) instead of names when extracting files from an archive. This can be useful when dealing with systems where the user or group names may not be identical between the source and target environments, but their corresponding numerical IDs are the same.'
        o: '[AI] The `tar` command with the option `-o` (or `--owner`) sets the ownership of files during extraction. It allows specifying a new owner and group for the extracted files, using the format `<user>:<group>`. For example, `tar -xopf archive.tar.gz file.txt -C /new/directory --owner=myuser:mymgroup` will extract `file.txt` to `/new/directory` with ownership set to `myuser:mymgroup`.'
        occurrence: |-
            [AI] The `--occurrence` option is not a valid flag for the `tar` command in GNU Tar or other common tar implementations. It seems there might be some confusion with other command-line tools that have similar names and flags.

            In general, `tar` is an archiving utility used to create, read, write, and extract files from various archive formats like .tar and .tgz (gzip compressed). Common flags in `tar` include:

            * `c`: Create a new archive.
            * `x`: Extract files from an archive.
            * `t`: List the contents of an archive without extracting them.
            * `f`: Use an archive file as the argument instead of standard input or output.

            For more details on these and other options, refer to your specific tar implementation's documentation.
        old-archive: '[AI] The `tar --old-archive` command is a utility in Unix-based systems for creating and manipulating tape archives. The `--old-archive` option is specifically used to create an old-format tar archive, which is a legacy format with fewer features compared to the newer gtar or bsdtar formats. This option is rarely used today as most modern use cases favor the newer formats due to their additional capabilities and compatibility with more tools. However, it might still be encountered in some specific situations, such as when dealing with older software packages or legacy systems.'
        one-file-system: '[AI] The `--one-file-system` option in `tar` is used to exclude subdirectories from being archived when they span multiple file systems. This means that only files within a single file system will be included in the tar archive, preventing potential issues during extraction such as inconsistent file system metadata or permission errors. In other words, this flag ensures that each tar file contains data from a single file system, maintaining the integrity and compatibility of the archived data.'
        one-top-level: '[AI] The `--one-top-level` flag is a option for the `tar` command in Unix and Linux systems. It is used to extract only the top level directory of an archived tarball, discarding the nested directories within it. This can be useful when dealing with archive structures where the inner most directory is intended to be the working directory upon extraction. For instance, `tar xzvf myarchive.tar.gz --one-top-level` will extract only the top level directory named ''myarchive'' from the archive.'
        overwrite: '[AI] The `--overwrite` option in the `tar` command is used to write files in the archive with the same name as existing files in the destination, overwriting the latter. Without this option, `tar` would skip overwriting existing files. This can be useful when creating or updating an archive and ensuring that specific files are included with their most recent versions.'
        overwrite-dir: '[AI] The `--overwrite-dir` option in the `tar` command is used to allow overwriting of directories during extraction or creation of tar archives. When this option is specified, a directory with the same name as an existing directory inside the archive will be replaced instead of causing an error. This can be useful when dealing with backups or synchronizing file systems, where ensuring that the most recent data overwrites older data is desirable.'
        owner: '[AI] The `--owner` option in the `tar` command is used to specify the new owner of files when they are extracted from a tar archive. This option takes an optional numeric UID (User ID) or GID (Group ID), or a username to set both the user and group ownership accordingly. For instance, `tar xvf --owner=myuser:mygroup file.tar` extracts the contents of `file.tar`, setting the new owner as `myuser` and the new group as `mygroup`.'
        owner-map: '[AI] The `--owner-map` option in the `tar` command is used to preserve the original file ownerships during tar and untar operations. When this option is specified, the user and group IDs of the source files are maintained in the tar archive and restored when extracting the archive. This ensures that file permissions are preserved along with ownership information. In other words, `--owner-map` helps to maintain the security context of files during archiving and restoration.'
        pax-option: '[AI] The `--pax` option with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems is used for creating or extracting archives while preserving the original file attributes and permissions, including ownership, timestamps, and symbolic links. The acronym `PAX` stands for "Portable Archive Exchange format," which facilitates the interchangeability of archive formats across various Unix systems. By using this option, you ensure that the archive preserves the file''s metadata accurately. For example, `tar -cpf output.tar --pax output_directory/` would create a PAX-preserving tar archive while maintaining the original file information.'
        portability: '[AI] The `--portability` flag in the `tar` command is used to create or extract tar archives with a specific format that is designed to be portable across different systems and environments. This means that the created archive should be able to be read and written by various tar implementations, regardless of differences in file permissions, ownerships, timestamps, or other system-specific details. By default, `tar` may not preserve these details exactly, so using `--portability` ensures a more consistent and reliable transfer of data between systems.'
        posix: |-
            [AI] The `--posix` option is a flag used with the `tar` command in Unix-like operating systems. It modifies the behavior of `tar` to conform to the POSIX standard for tar files, which means:

            1. Only standard files (regular files, hard links, and symlinks) are written to tar files.
            2. The order of extraction is preserved.
            3. Long file names are handled correctly without any truncation or mangling.
            4. Permissions, ownerships, and timestamps are respected during extraction.
        preserve-order: '[AI] The `--preserve-order` option in the `tar` command is used to maintain the original order of files in the archive. Without this option, files are extracted in the order they appear in the tar file, which might not reflect their original directory structure or hierarchy. With `--preserve-order`, the files are extracted in the same order as they were in the original directory before archiving. This is particularly useful when dealing with directories containing many files and preserving the original file tree structure is essential.'
        preserve-permissions: '[AI] The `--preserve-permissions` flag is a option used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems for archiving files. It instructs tar to preserve the original file permissions, ownerships, and timestamps when extracting files from the archive. This means that the extracted files will have the same permissions, ownerships, and timestamps as the original files in the archive. This is useful when preserving metadata during backups or file transfers.'
        quote-chars: '[AI] `tar` is a common data compression and archiving utility in Unix-like operating systems. The option `--quote-chars=CHAR` is used to specify a character that should be escaped when extracting files with special characters in their names from tar archives. This helps avoid issues with pathnames containing those special characters. For example, if CHAR is set to ''\'', then a file named "My File\ with spaces.txt" will be extracted as "My File with spaces.txt".'
        quoting-style: |-
            [AI] The `--quoting-style` option in the `tar` command is used to specify how filenames with special characters should be quoted during tar extraction or creation. It accepts three values:

            1. `none`: No quoting is applied to filenames, even if they contain special characters. This can lead to errors if the filenames are not handled correctly by the extracting system.
            2. `shell-esc`: Filenames are quoted using a leading and trailing backslash (\). This allows the shell to interpret the backslashes as escape characters and preserve the original filenames, but it may not be portable across all systems.
            3. `safe_overescaping=on|off`: Filenames are quoted using a leading and trailing single quote (''). With this option set to 'on', tar will handle escaping special characters within quotes itself, ensuring that the original filenames are preserved and allowing the use of literal quotes within filenames. With it set to 'off', tar does not perform any character escaping inside the quotes, leaving that task to the user or the shell.
        read-full-records: '[AI] The `--read-full-records` option in the `tar` command is used to read and output tar records completely, without truncation. By default, `tar` outputs each record up to its header size (512 bytes). With this flag, `tar` will output the entire record, regardless of its size. This can be useful when dealing with large or corrupted tar archives where full records need to be inspected for troubleshooting or data extraction purposes.'
        record-size: '[AI] The `--record-size` option in the `tar` command sets the size of a record or data chunk written to the tar archive. It specifies the number of bytes in each record, and by default, it is set to 512 bytes. Adjusting this value can affect the compression ratio and the speed of the tar operation. A larger record size may lead to better compression but slower writing, while a smaller record size may result in faster writing but less effective compression.'
        recursion: '[AI] The `--recursion` option in the `tar` command is used to create or extract archives recursively, meaning it will include all files and directories within the specified directory hierarchy. This is useful when working with large or complex directories containing multiple levels of subdirectories. Without `--recursion`, only the top-level directory would be included in the archive.'
        recursive-unlink: '[AI] The `--recursive-unlink` option in the `tar` command is used to remove files or directories recursively when extracting an archive. When this option is specified during extraction, any empty directories encountered will be removed, along with the files and directories they contain. This can be useful when dealing with backups or archives that have redundant or unnecessary files and directories. However, use this option with caution as it permanently deletes data.'
        remove-files: '[AI] The `--remove-files` option is a flag used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems for archiving and extracting files. When this flag is specified during extraction, tar will remove the source files from the file system after they have been successfully extracted from the archive. This can be useful for ensuring that the original files are overwritten or deleted when extracting an updated version of a file into the same location. However, use this option with caution as it can lead to data loss if used incorrectly.'
        restrict: '[AI] The `--restrict` option in the `tar` command is used to restrict creation or extraction of files based on their names or modes. It allows specifying a list of patterns to include or exclude during the operation. For example, `--remove-file` removes extracted files that already exist and `--one-file-system` prevents traversing multiple file systems during archive creation or extraction. These are specific uses of `--restrict`. Overall, it provides control over file selection based on their names and attributes during the `tar` operation.'
        rmt-command: '[AI] The `--remove-file` or shorthand `--rmf-force` option, also known as the `--remove-command` or `--rmt-command`, is a flag used with the `tar` (Tape Archive) command in Unix and Linux systems. This option instructs `tar` to remove source files or directories from the file system after they have been successfully extracted from an archive. In other words, it ensures that the original files are deleted after being restored from the archive. This is particularly useful when working with backups or managing file versions where no longer needed copies should be removed from the system.'
        rsh-command: '[AI] The `--rsync-rsh` option in `tar` is used to specify a custom remote shell (RSH) command to be used when using `tar` with the `pqfe` options for creating or updating tar archives across a network using `rsync`-like behavior. This can be useful when connecting to remote servers with specific RSH requirements, such as SSH. The flag takes the RSH command as an argument (e.g., `--rsync-rsh="ssh -i keyfile"`).'
        same-order: '[AI] The `--same-order` option in the `tar` command is used to preserve the original order of files within a directory when extracting or archiving. When this option is not used, the order of extracted files may be changed due to the way tar handles directories and file names during the compression/decompression process. By using `--same-order`, you ensure that the files are extracted in the same order they originally appeared in the source directory.'
        same-owner: '[AI] The `--same-owner` option in the `tar` command is used to preserve file ownership and permissions during the archiving or extraction process. When this option is specified, tar ensures that the original file''s owner and group are maintained for each file being processed. This can be particularly useful when working with files that have specific access control lists or ownership requirements. By using `--same-owner`, you ensure that the archive faithfully reflects the original file state, both in terms of content and metadata.'
        same-permissions: '[AI] The `--same-permissions` option in the `tar` command is used to preserve file permission bits during the extraction process. When this option is specified, tar will restore original file permissions after extracting files from an archive. This means that file modes, such as read, write, and execute permissions, are maintained for directories and files during the extraction process. This can be useful when transferring or restoring files between systems with similar permission structures to ensure consistent access control.'
        seek: '[AI] The `--seek` option in the `tar` command is used to move the read or write pointer to a specific offset within the tar file without extracting or appending any data. This can be useful when working with large files or when performing certain low-level operations on tar archives. It takes an argument representing the desired offset. For example, `tar --seek=1M myarchive.tar` moves the read pointer to the 1 megabyte mark within the file `myarchive.tar`.'
        selinux: |-
            [AI] The `tar --selinux` command is a modification of the standard `tar` (tape archiving) utility in Linux. It includes an option `--selinux` that enables the creation and restoration of SELinux contexts for files during the archiving and extraction process.

            SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a security extension for Linux operating systems, which provides mandatory access control to enforce fine-grained security policies. Each file and process has an associated security context that defines its level of privileges.

            With `tar --selinux`, the SELinux contexts are saved alongside the file data when archiving and can be restored when extracting, ensuring the correct security contexts for the files remain intact during the transfer or backup process. This helps maintain the desired security policy and state of the system.
        show-defaults: '[AI] The `tar --show-defaults` command in GNU Tar is used to display the current set of default options for tar commands. It provides information about how tar will behave during extraction or creation of tar archives, without actually performing any operation. This can be helpful for understanding the behavior of tar in a given environment and for troubleshooting issues related to tar operations.'
        show-omitted-dirs: '[AI] The `--show-omitted-dirs` option is a flag used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems. When extracting an archive, this flag causes tar to display the names of directories that are present in the archive but were omitted during the extraction due to extracting into a subdirectory of the original directory structure. This can be useful for understanding the original directory layout when restoring files from a backup.'
        show-snapshot-field-ranges: '[AI] The `--show-snapshot-field-ranges` option in the `tar` command displays the byte ranges of each field within the tar archive''s header. This information is useful for understanding the layout and format of the headers, which can aid in data extraction or validation of archives.'
        show-stored-names: '[AI] The `tar --show-stored-names` command is used with the tar archiving utility in Unix or Linux systems. This option, when specified, lists only the names of the files stored in the tar archive without extracting them. This can be useful for checking the contents of a tar file without taking up extra disk space by extracting the files unnecessarily.'
        show-transformed-names: '[AI] `tar --show-transformed-names` is a flag used with the `tar` command in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. This option affects how file names are displayed during extraction of tar archives. With `--show-transformed-names`, tar will show the original file names of the extracted files, along with any transformations applied during the archiving process, such as hard links or symlinks being shown as the target file name instead of the link itself. This can be useful for understanding the relationship between the files in the archive and their corresponding files in the extracted directory.'
        skip-old-files: '[AI] The `--skip-old-files` option in the `tar` command is used when extracting or updating files with tar. It tells tar to only extract files that have newer versions in the archive than on disk, and ignore files that already exist and have the same or older version in both the archive and on disk. This can save time and resources by avoiding unnecessary file copying when working with large archives or frequent updates.'
        sort: '[AI] The `tar --sort` command is used with the tar archiving utility in Unix-like operating systems. The `--sort` option sorts the output of the `tar xf` (extract) or `tar tf` (list) commands based on the file modification time, with the newest files appearing first. This can be useful when dealing with large numbers of files and wanting to ensure that newly extracted or listed files are processed after older ones.'
        sparse: '[AI] The `--sparse` option in `tar` is used to create or extract sparse archives. Sparse files are large files that only occupy a specific amount of disk space based on the data within them, instead of taking up the full size as if all bytes were populated with data. This can be useful for handling large, empty areas in a file, such as in backups or image files, reducing disk usage and improving efficiency. With `tar --sparse`, these sparse files are handled as regular files during archival and extraction processes, preserving their sparseness.'
        sparse-version: '[AI] The `--sparse-version` option in the `tar` command is used when creating or extracting sparse tar files. A sparse file is a special type of file that only occupies storage for the data it actually contains, saving disk space by not storing zeros unnecessarily. With `--sparse-version`, the `tar` command creates or extracts such sparse files as part of the archive. This can be useful when dealing with large files with a significant amount of empty space.'
        starting-file: '[AI] The `--starting-file` option in the `tar` command is used to specify a file as the reference point for archiving or extracting files from a tar archive. When extracting, `--starting-file` tells tar to begin the extraction at that specific file instead of starting at the root directory of the archive. This can be useful when dealing with large archives or when you want to extract only a subset of the files within it. When archiving, this option is not commonly used as the default behavior is to include all files under the specified directory hierarchy.'
        strip-components: '[AI] `tar --strip-components` is a command-line option used with the `tar` utility in Linux and Unix systems for extracting archives. The `--strip-components` option specifies the number of directories to remove from the extracted path. For example, if an extracted file path is "/archive/file.txt" and you use "--strip-components 1", the resulting path will be "./file.txt". This can simplify the extracted paths or help move files directly into a desired directory.'
        suffix: '[AI] The `--suffix` option in the `tar` command is used to specify a string that will be appended as a suffix to the names of extracted files from a tar archive. For example, if you have a gzipped tarball named "data.tar.gz" and you want to extract its contents with a ".bak" suffix, you can use the following command: `tar xf data.tar.gz --suffix=.bak` This will result in extracted files with names like "data.txt.bak" instead of just "data.txt".'
        tape-length: '[AI] The `--tape-length` option in the `tar` command is used to specify the maximum length of data read or written as a single I/O operation from/to magnetic tapes or other sequential devices. By default, `tar` reads or writes data in blocks of 512 bytes, but this option allows increasing the block size up to the limit supported by the device, which can improve performance when dealing with large files or multiple small files in a single archive. The value is given in bytes. For example, `--tape-length=10M` sets the I/O length to 10 megabytes.'
        test-label: '[AI] The `tar --test-label` command in Tar, a common archiving utility, is used to check the labels or comments associated with tar files without extracting their contents. By providing the `--test-label` option followed by the tar file name as an argument, you can examine the stored label without affecting the archive itself.'
        to-command: '[AI] The `--to-command` option in the `tar` command is used to specify a custom command that should be run after extracting the archive contents. This option takes one argument, which is the command string. When an archive is extracted using the `tar xf` command and this option is set, the extracted files will first be processed by the given command before being accessed normally. This can be useful for automating certain tasks during archive extraction. For example, you might use it to apply some file permissions or ownerships, run a script on each extracted file, or perform any other custom action.'
        to-stdout: '[AI] The `--to-stdout` option in the `tar` command is used to write the extracted contents of a tarball directly to the standard output stream (i.e., the terminal), instead of creating or appending to a file. This can be useful for piping the output to other commands, such as `gzip`, `less`, or `xargs`. The flag modifies the behavior of the `tar` command to not create a new file but rather print its contents on the console.'
        totals: '[AI] The `--totals` option in the `tar` command is used to display the total size of each extracted directory or file, along with the name and permissions. When you extract files from a tar archive using this option, tar will print out a summary line for each file or directory, indicating its name, permissions, and the total size before extraction. This can be useful when you want to see the disk usage of the files in an archive before extracting them.'
        touch: '[AI] The `tar` command with the `--touch` option is used in Unix-based systems for updating the modification time of files, without changing their content or archiving them. When you run `tar cf -- --file <path> --touch`, it only updates the modification time of the specified file, as if it had been accessed or modified.'
        transform: '[AI] `tar --transform` is an option used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems for extracting or creating tar archives. It allows users to apply a shell-style expression to each file name during the extraction process, enabling renaming of files before they are extracted or written to the archive. The syntax is as follows: `--transform=''pattern{/REPLACEMENT/g}''`. Here, ''pattern'' specifies a regular expression that matches the file names in the archive, and ''{/REPLACEMENT/g}'' defines the new name for the matched files. This can be useful when dealing with large numbers of files requiring consistent renaming.'
        uncompress: '[AI] The `tar --uncompress` command is used in Linux and Unix systems to extract files from a tarball (a type of compressed archive file with the ".tar.gz" or ".tgz" extension). The "--uncompress" option tells tar to use an external compression program like gzip to decompress the archive before extracting the files. When you run `tar xzf <archive_name>.tar.gz`, the command first decompresses the archive using gzip and then extracts the files.'
        ungzip: '[AI] The `tar --uncompress` or shorthand `tar --u` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems used for combining multiple files into a single archive, called a tarball, and compressing it using gzip or another compression method. The `--ungzip` or `-J` option with this command is used to extract the contents of a gzipped tarball by decompressing the gzip compression, resulting in an uncompressed tarball, which can then be extracted using the `tar -xvf` command. In summary, `tar --ungzip` or `tar --uJ` is used to extract the contents of a gzipped tarball without the need for separately decompressing the gzip compression.'
        unlink-first: '[AI] `tar --unlink-first` is a command-line option for the `tar` utility in Unix-based systems. It specifies that files should be extracted from the archive in reverse order of their appearance, and that the first file extracted should be removed from the working directory before extraction begins. This can be useful when extracting files into a directory that already contains some of the same files, to avoid overwriting existing files with newer versions accidentally.'
        unquote: '[AI] The `tar --unquote` option is used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems for extracting files from a tar archive. It tells the `tar` command to treat escape sequences in file names within the archive as literal characters instead of special characters. This is particularly useful when dealing with archive files containing file names that include spaces or other special characters, as these can cause extraction issues without the `--unquote` option.'
        update: '[AI] The `tar --update` or `tar -u` command in the `tar` utility is used to update an existing tar archive with new files or modifications to existing ones. It appends new data to existing files in the archive without overwriting them, and adds any new files not already present in the archive. This option is useful when you want to add new versions of files to a previously created archive while preserving the previous versions.'
        usage: '[AI] The `tar` `--usage` option is used to display a help message or usage information for the `tar` command. When you run `tar --usage` in your terminal, it will print out detailed information about how to use the `tar` command, including valid options and their descriptions. This can be helpful if you''re unsure of the correct syntax for using `tar` to create or extract archives.'
        use-compress-program: '[AI] The `--use-compress-program` option in the `tar` command is used to specify a custom compress program to be used when creating or extracting tar archives. By default, `tar` uses gzip for compression, but with this flag, you can specify an alternative compressor such as bzip2 (`--use-compress-program=bzip2`) or xz (`--use-compress-program=xz`). This allows users to choose the compression algorithm that best suits their needs based on factors like file size reduction and decompression speed.'
        utc: '[AI] The `--utc` option in the `tar` command is used to create or extract archives with Unix Coordinated Time (UTC) as the time standard. This means that the timestamps for files inside the archive will reflect the actual UTC time, and not the local time of the system where the `tar` command is being run. This can be useful when dealing with archives that need to maintain consistent timestamps across different systems or locations.'
        verbatim-files-from: '[AI] The `--verbatim-files-from` option in the `tar` command is used to include special characters or filenames with unusual characters in tar files without modification. By default, tar escapes special characters in filenames during extraction, which can lead to incorrect filenames being restored. With `--verbatim-files-from`, tar will preserve the exact filename as it appears in the archive when extracting files. This option is particularly useful when dealing with archives containing non-standard filenames.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `--verbose` flag used with the `tar` command in Unix-based systems increases the amount of output information displayed during the compression or extraction process. It provides more details about the files being processed, including file names, sizes, and permissions. This can be helpful for debugging or understanding what actions the tar command is performing.'
        verify: '[AI] `tar --verify` is a command used with the tar archiving utility in Unix-like operating systems. This option is used to verify the integrity of previously created tar archives by checking the stored Adler-32 or CRC-32 checksums against the computed ones from the archive''s contents during extraction. It ensures data consistency and helps prevent unintended modifications or corruption in the archive.'
        version: '[AI] `tar --version` is a command used in Unix-based systems to display version information about the GNU Tar archive utility. When executed, it returns output showing the tar version number, compilation settings, and other relevant details such as operating system and build date. This helps users ensure they have the latest version or check the compatibility of their current installation with other software.'
        volno-file: '[AI] The `--no-volume-name` flag in the `tar` command is used to prevent giving a name to created volumes during the extraction or creation of tar archives using the `docker exec` or `docker run --rm` commands with the `tar` as the command. It means that the extracted or created volumes will not be named and instead, they will be identified by their anonymous IDs. This flag is particularly useful when working with multiple volumes and wanting to avoid naming conflicts or simplifying volume management.'
        warning: '[AI] The `--warning` option in the `tar` command is used to produce warnings when certain conditions are met during the archiving or extraction process. It does not prevent any actions, but rather alerts the user about potential issues that may need attention. For instance, it can be used to warn about file permission changes, file collisions during extraction, or when extracting to a non-empty directory.'
        wildcards: '[AI] `tar --wildcards` is a option in the `tar` command used in Unix-based systems for creating and extracting archives. This option enables globbing behavior when specifying file names as arguments to the `-T` (or `--file`) option which lists files to be added or excluded from the archive. For instance, instead of passing individual file names such as `file1.txt file2.txt`, you can use wildcards like `file*.txt` allowing you to handle multiple files that match the pattern in one go. This can save time and effort when dealing with large sets of similar files.'
        wildcards-match-slash: '[AI] The `--wildcards-match-slash` option in the `tar` command is used to match slash (/) characters in tarball file name wildcards. When this option is enabled, tar recognizes a trailing slash in a wildcard pattern as a directory indicator. For example, `tar xf archive.tar --wildcards-match-slash /path/to/dir/*/` will extract all files under the `/path/to/dir/` directory that match the given wildcard pattern. Without this option, tar would treat each slash as a separate pattern element and fail to extract the desired files.'
        xattrs: '[AI] The `tar` command with the `--xattrs` option is used to preserve extended file attributes when creating or extracting tar archives. Extended file attributes are additional data stored alongside a file, such as ACLs (Access Control Lists) and user-defined attributes. By using the `--xattrs` flag, these attributes will be preserved during the tar operation. This can be important for ensuring that the file attributes of the original files are maintained when working with tar archives.'
        xattrs-exclude: '[AI] `tar --xattrs-exclude` is a flag used with the `tar` command in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. This flag allows excluding specific extended file attributes when creating or updating a tar archive using the `tar` command. The syntax for using this flag is `--xattrs-exclude=<pattern>`, where `<pattern>` is a pattern that matches the extended file attribute names to be excluded. For example, `--xattrs-exclude=''*.com:*''` would exclude all Compressed Unix file attributes from being archived. This flag can be useful when dealing with files or directories having unnecessary or unwanted extended attributes and wanting to minimize the archive size or maintain consistency between different systems.'
        xattrs-include: '[AI] The `--xattrs-include` option in the `tar` command is used to include specific extended file attributes when creating or updating a tar archive. By specifying one or more attributes with this option, only the files with those attributes will be affected when using the `tar` command for archiving or extraction. This can be useful when working with files that have complex metadata and you want to ensure their attributes are preserved during backup or transfer processes.'
        xform: '[AI] The `--xform` option in the `tar` command is used to modify or filter the data inside tar files before extracting them. It applies various transformations such as compression, decompression, text transformations (like case conversions or text substitutions), and even executing shell commands on the file contents. The general syntax is `--xform=" formula "`, where ''formula'' specifies the transformation to be applied. For example, `--xform=''s/oldtext/newtext/g''` replaces all occurrences of ''oldtext'' with ''newtext'' in text files inside the tar archive.'
        xz: |-
            [AI] The command `tar --xz` is used in Unix-based systems for extracting compressed tar files using gzip compression.

            The `tar` is an archiving utility, which can create and manipulate tarfiles. The options `--x` (extract) and `--z` (filter the archive through gzip) are used together to extract a gzipped tarfile. This results in the files being extracted from the tararchive and the gzip compression being removed, leaving the original file format.
        zstd: '[AI] `tar --zstd` is a command used in Unix-based systems for creating or extracting tar archives with the Zstandard (ZSTD) compression method. The `tar` part is an archiving utility, while `--zstd` is a flag that specifies the use of Zstandard compression when compressing or expanding data within the archive. This combination allows achieving high compression ratios while maintaining good decompression speeds.'
