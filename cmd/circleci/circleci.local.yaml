documentation:
    command: '[AI] `circleci local` is a CircleCI command-line tool that allows users to run CircleCI workflows and jobs locally for development testing or debugging purposes. It''s essentially a way to bring CircleCI functionality to your local environment, without pushing code to the CircleCI platform. The command downloads the required Docker images, runs the tests specified in your .circleci/config.yml file, and provides output similar to what you would see in the CircleCI web interface.'
