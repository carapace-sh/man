    command: '[AI] The `systemctl list-machines` command is used to display a list of all machine files (also known as machine configurations or machine units) in the systemd system and session manager''s machine directory (usually located at `/etc/machine-info/`). Machine files define properties and settings for remote machines or containers that can be managed by systemd. This command does not start or stop machines but just lists their names, which can be used as arguments to other systemctl commands for managing those machines.'
