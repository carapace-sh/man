    command: '[AI] `brew nodenv-sync` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command synchronizes NVM (Node Version Manager) with Node.js versions managed by a separate Node Environment Variables (N env) tool called `nodenv`. By running `brew nodenv-sync`, you ensure that Homebrew''s list of available Node.js versions is updated to match NVM, maintaining consistency between the two tools and providing access to the latest Node.js versions via `nodenv`.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `brew nodenv-sync --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command uses Nodenv, a Node.js version management plugin for Homebrew. The `--debug` flag enables debug mode during the execution of `nodenv-sync`. It synchronizes and manages multiple Node.js versions installed through Homebrew and ensures that the correct version is used for each project. Running it with debug mode will provide more detailed information about what the command does, making it useful for troubleshooting or gaining a deeper understanding of how Nodenv functions.'
        help: '[AI] `brew nodenv-sync --help` is a command used in the terminal on macOS systems with Homebrew and Nodenev installed. This command, when run, displays detailed help information about the `nodenv-sync` sub-command of Nodenev. Nodenvenv is a version manager for Node.js, allowing users to easily switch between multiple installations of Node.js. The `--help` flag generates a detailed usage guide that explains how to use `nodenv-sync` with various options, including its purpose, which is to keep Homebrew''s Node.js and Nodenvenv configurations in sync.'
        quiet: |-
            [AI] `brew nodenv-sync --quiet` is a command used in macOS with Homebrew (a package manager) and Node.js (a JavaScript runtime). The `nodenv` part of the command refers to Node.Env, a Homebrew plugin that manages multiple node version installations.

            The `nodenv-sync` subcommand tells Homebrew to ensure all installed Node.js versions have the correct `nodenv` shims in place. This means it updates symlinks to different Node.js versions so the `nodenv` tool can use them correctly.

            The `--quiet` option makes the command run without displaying any informational messages during execution, resulting in a silent operation.
        verbose: '[AI] `brew nodenv-sync --verbose` is a command used in MacOS with Homebrew package manager and Nodenv, a Node.js version management tool. This command syncs Nodenv with the latest Node. versions available in Homebrew, displaying detailed information about the process in real time. It ensures that the local Node.js installations are consistent with those managed by Homebrew for optimal environment setup.'
