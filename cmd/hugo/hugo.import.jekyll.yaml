documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `hugo import jekyll` command is used to import a Jekyll blog into Hugo, a static site generator. It reads Jekyll data files (such as `_posts`, `_config.yml`, and front matter in Markdown files) and converts them into Hugo content. The imported data is then available for building and publishing a Hugo site using the Hugo command-line interface or a theme.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `hugo import jekyll` is a command used in Hugo, a popular static site generator for building websites and blogs. This command is utilized to import Jekyll data files into a Hugo project. By appending `--force`, the command overwrites any existing Hugo files with the same names as those being imported, without prompting for confirmation. In other words, it forces the import process even if there are file conflicts.'
