documentation:
    command: '[AI] "Benthos Streams" is not a standard command in any known programming language or tool. It may be a term specific to a particular domain or project, possibly related to marine or river ecology studies using the Benthos platform. In this context, it could refer to real-time data streams from underwater sensors monitoring benthic environments for various parameters like water quality, temperature, and biological activity. For more information, it''s essential to consult the specific documentation or community associated with "Benthos Streams."'
    flag:
        no-api: '[AI] The `benthos streams --no-api` is a command used in Benthos, an open-source data processing pipeline. This command runs Benthos in streaming mode without using the API. Streaming mode processes data as it comes in real-time, while disabling the API means that external requests are not accepted and the system focuses solely on the incoming stream.'
        prefix-stream-endpoints: '[AI] The `benthos --prefix-stream-endpoints` flag is used with the Benthos data processing system. It sets a prefix for all input and output stream URLs in the configuration file. This allows organizing multiple streams under a common base URL, simplifying management and reducing repetition in the configuration file. For example, if you have multiple Kafka input streams, each with a unique URL, you can use this flag to set a prefix for all of them, making your configuration cleaner and more consistent.'
