documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `gh extension search` command is used with the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool to search for GitHub Marketplace extensions. This command allows users to find and discover new extensions that can be installed and used within their GitHub workflows, IDEs, or other tools for enhanced functionality. The search query can be provided as an argument for specific results. For instance: `gh extension search typescript`.'
    flag:
        jq: |-
            [AI] `gh` is a GitHub command-line tool. The command `gh extension search --jq` is used to search for extensions in the GitHub Marketplace that match a given query using the `jq` language for filtering and processing JSON data.

            The `extension search` subcommand searches for extensions based on keywords provided, while `--jq` allows the user to use the JQ query language to filter and manipulate the output JSON data. Together, these commands enable users to efficiently find and select specific GitHub extensions that meet their requirements.
        json: |-
            [AI] `gh` is a command-line tool for GitHub interaction. The given command, `gh extension search --json`, is used to search for extensions available in the GitHub Marketplace with filtering and outputting results in JSON format.

            Here's a brief explanation of the individual parts:

            1. `gh`: Invokes GitHub CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool.
            2. `extension`: Specifies that we are working with extensions.
            3. `search`: Indicates that we want to perform a search operation.
            4. `--json`: Requests the output in JSON format for further processing or analysis.
        license: '[AI] The `gh extension search --license` command is used with GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, `gh`. This command searches for GitHub extensions that have a specific license. You can provide the license name or its key as an argument to the command. For example, `--license MIT` will search for extensions licensed under the MIT license. The output of this command provides information about each extension such as its name, author, description, and version number.'
        limit: '[AI] The `gh extension search --limit` command is used with GitHub''s `gh` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool to search for extensions available on GitHub Marketplace. The `--limit` option sets the maximum number of results returned by the command in a single page. By default, it returns 10 results per page but you can increase this limit using the `--limit` flag followed by the desired number. For instance, `gh extension search --limit 25` would return 25 extensions per page. This is helpful when you need to quickly browse through a large number of extensions and don''t want to manually navigate multiple pages.'
        order: '[AI] The `gh extension search --order` command is used with GitHub''s command-line tool (GitHub CLI or gh) to search for extensions in the GitHub Marketplace. The `--order` option specifies the sorting order of the search results. Supported values include "popularity" (default), "relevance", and "installed". For example, `gh extension search --order popularity` returns the most popular extensions first.'
        owner: '[AI] The `gh extension search --owner` command is used in GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, called `gh`. This specific command searches for extensions owned by a particular user or organization within the GitHub Marketplace. By providing an owner argument, you can filter the search results to display only those extensions belonging to that specific user or organization.'
        sort: '[AI] The `gh extension search --sort` command is used in GitHub''s command-line tool (Git Hub for Desktop or git-hub CLI) to search for extensions available on GitHub Marketplace. The `--sort` option specifies how the search results should be ordered, for example, by popularity, newest, or alphabetically. The output will list the extension name, author, description, and installation instructions.'
        template: '[AI] The `gh extension search --template` command is used with GitHub''s `gh` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool to search for extensions (also known as apps or integrations) in the GitHub Marketplace that match a given template. The template can be specified using various parameters such as language, framework, or package manager. This command returns JSON output containing metadata of matching extensions.'
        web: '[AI] The `gh extend search --web` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to perform extended searches in GitHub repositories, using a web interface. The `--web` flag opens the search results in a web browser instead of displaying them directly in the terminal. The `gh extend search` command allows for more complex queries with multiple keywords and filters.'
