            [AI] `flatpak permission-show` is a command-line utility in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. This command displays permissions that have been granted or denied for a specific application or runtime. The option `--help` provides information about how to use the `permission-show` command with various arguments and options. It prints out a usage message explaining what the command does, the format of valid arguments, and examples of commands you can use. For instance, `flatpak permission-show --help` will display something like:

            ```text
            Usage: flatpak permission-show [OPTIONS] [--] [GROUP|APPLICATION]

            Show the permissions for a given Flatpak application or group.

            Options:
              -h, --help               Show this help message and exit.
              --app=APPLICATION        The Flatpak application to show permissions for.
              --group=GROUP            The Flatpak group to show permissions for.
            ```

            This helps users understand how they can use the command effectively to manage their applications' permissions in Flatpak.
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] The `flatpak permission-show` command is used to display permissions granted to Flatpak applications on a system, specifically for those using the OSTREE filesystem backend. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output provided, displaying detailed information about each permission including the application ID, user or mask, and the path or URL of the resource being granted access. The `--ostree-verbose` option is an additional flag specifically for OSTREE backends, providing even more verbose output related to the OSTREE filesystem and its snapshots.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak permission-show` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and sandboxing technology. The verbose option `--verbose` is used to display detailed information about the permissions granted or required for a specific application or runtime. When you run `flatpak permission-show --verbose <application-or-runtime>`, it will list all the permissions (access control rules) that are currently active for the given Flatpak entity, including their source, target, and current status (allowed or denied). This can help in troubleshooting application compatibility issues or managing access control settings.'
