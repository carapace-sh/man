        [AI] The `apt-cache dotty` command is a utility provided by apt (Advanced Package Tool), which is used for interacting with the local package repository index files. This specific command displays the dependency tree of packages, showing the hierarchical relationships between them in a graph-like format.

        When you run `apt-cache dotty [package]`, it generates and displays the dependency tree for the specified package as a series of indented lines, where each line represents a parent-child relationship between packages. This command helps to understand the dependencies and their cascading effects when installing or upgrading software using APT.
