name: etcd-peer
description: Generate the certificate for etcd nodes to communicate with each other
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save and store the certificates.
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubernetes-version=: Choose a specific Kubernetes version for the control plane.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command `kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer` is used to generate and output the Etcd peer certification files during the initialization process of a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. The "etcd-peer" argument specifies that these files are intended for use in an Etcd cluster member that will serve as a peer to other members. These certificates are necessary to secure communication between different Etcd peers in the cluster and ensure data consistency.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line utility for bootstrapping a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm. The `phase certs etcd-peer --cert-dir` option specifies that `kubeadm init` should generate and output the SSL certificates needed for etcd members to securely communicate with each other. The `--cert-dir` flag indicates that these certificates should be saved in the specified directory.'
        config: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The option `phase certs etcd-peer --config <path>` specifies that this command should generate and output the Etcd peer certificate authorities (CAs) for use in setting up a secure, distributed Etcd cluster. The `--config <path>` argument is used to specify the location of the Kubernetes configuration file, which contains various settings for the cluster. These CA certificates are necessary for establishing secure communication between Etcd peers in the cluster.'

            [AI] The command `kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer --kubernetes-version` is used to generate and configure Etcd peer certificates during the initial setup of a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm.

            Here's a brief explanation of each component in this command:

            1. `kubeadm`: A tool for bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters, managing the Kubernetes master node, and performing various administrative tasks on a Kubernetes cluster.
            2. `init`: The subcommand used to perform an initial setup or configuration of a new Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm.
            3. `phase certs`: Specifies that you want to generate and configure the certificate authorities (CAs) and client/server certificates for the specified components during the initialization phase.
            4. `etcd-peer`: Indicates that the command will generate and configure peer certificates specifically for Etcd, which is a distributed key-value store used as the backend for the Kubernetes API server.
            5. `--kubernetes-version`: Specifies the version of Kubernetes you wish to use during this operation. The kubeadm tool uses this information to download and install the appropriate components according to the specified version.
