name: mouseup
description: Send a mouseup for the given button
flags:
    --clearmodifiers: Clear modifiers before clicking
    --delay=: Specify how long, in milliseconds, to delay between clicks
    --repeat=: Specify how many times to click
    --window=: Specify a window to send a click to
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `xdotool mouseup` is a command used in Linux systems to simulate a mouse button release event. It is part of the xdotool toolkit which allows users to automate various input and window management tasks. By sending a "mouseup" event, you can programmatically release a mouse button, often used in scripts for more advanced mouse automation or testing purposes.'
    flag:
        clearmodifiers: '[AI] `xdotool mouseup --clearmodifiers` is a command from the xdotool toolkit, used to simulate a mouse button release event in the X Window System. The `--clearmodifiers` option resets all modifier keys (Shift, Control, Alt, and Super) to their default state before the mouse button release, ensuring that no modifier keys are active during the event. This can be useful for automating interactions with graphical applications that require specific key combinations or modifier states.'
        delay: |-
            [AI] `xdotool mouseup --delay` is a command used in the xdotool tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical user interface (GUI) programmatically. The `mouseup` action simulates releasing a mouse button, and the option `--delay` specifies a delay in milliseconds before executing the next command. This can be useful when dealing with GUI elements that require a delay between actions to function correctly. For instance, you might use this command sequence to click on an element, wait for it to open a context menu, and then select an option from the menu:

            ```bash
            xdotool search --name "Context Menu" windowactivate
            xdotool mousebutton 1 up --delay 200
            xdotool click <menu_option>
            ```
        repeat: |-
            [AI] `xdotool mouseup --repeat` is a command used in the xdotool toolset for automating interactions with a graphical user interface (GUI) in Linux and Unix-based systems.

            The command `mouseup` instructs xdotool to simulate a mouse button release event. The `--repeat` flag enables the repeat mode, meaning that the command will repeatedly execute the mouseup event multiple times without requiring separate invocations for each event. This can be useful for automating rapid mouse button releases or clicks.

            For instance, using `xdotool mouseup --repeat 5` would simulate releasing a mouse button five times in quick succession.
        window: '[AI] `xdotool mouseup` is a command from the xdotool toolset, used to simulate mouse actions programmatically in the X Window System environment. The `--window` option specifies which window to apply the action to. In this case, `mouseup` means releasing a mouse button, so the entire command `xdotool mouseup --window <window_id>` releases the mouse button for the specified window.'
