documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dmesg` is a Linux command used to display the system kernel message buffer. It shows recent kernel messages, including boot messages, error messages, and other system events. The output is typically sorted by time with the most recent messages appearing first. It provides valuable information for troubleshooting system issues and understanding system events.'
    flag:
        buffer-size: '[AI] The `dmesg` command in Linux is used to display the system message buffer, which contains various kernel messages and notifications. The option `--buffer-size` allows specifying a custom size for the amount of data that will be displayed. By default, `dmesg` displays the last few lines of the buffer, but with `--buffer-size`, you can display a larger or smaller range of messages based on your needs. It''s useful when dealing with large amounts of kernel output and wanting to examine a specific time frame or set of messages.'
        clear: '[AI] `dmesg --clear` is a Linux command used to clear the system message buffer displayed by the `dmesg` command. The `--clear` option resets the buffer, erasing all previously displayed messages, allowing new messages to be displayed when the `dmesg` command is run again.'
        color: '[AI] `dmesg --color` is a Linux command used to display the system message buffer, which contains important kernel messages and notices. The `--color` option enables colored output for various message types for better readability. For example, error messages are displayed in red, warning messages in yellow, and informational messages in white. This can make it easier to quickly identify the type and severity of messages in the system log.'
        console-level: '[AI] `dmesg --console-level` is a Linux command used to display the system message buffer, which contains kernel messages and other important system events. The `--console-level` option sets the console message level for filtering the displayed messages. It allows specifying a threshold level for messages to be shown, such as "error", "warning", "info", or "debug". This can help in diagnosing specific issues by reducing the amount of irrelevant information displayed.'
        console-off: '[AI] The `dmesg` command in Linux is used to display the kernel message buffer, which contains important system messages generated by the kernel. The option `--console-off` is used to disable the console output of `dmesg`. This means that when you run `dmesg --console-off`, the output will not be displayed on the console, but instead will be written to the file /dev/ttySXX or /dev/ptxx, depending on the configuration. This can be useful if you want to redirect the output to a file for further analysis without cluttering the terminal screen.'
        console-on: '[AI] `dmesg --console-on` is a command used in Linux systems to display the kernel message buffer, which contains important system messages generated during boot up or runtime. The `--console-on` option keeps the terminal in console mode after running the command, allowing users to interact with the raw console output. This can be useful for troubleshooting system issues or examining real-time kernel messages.'
        ctime: '[AI] `dmesg` is a Linux command used to display the system kernel message buffer. The option `--ctime` or `-C` formats the output using human-readable datetime strings, making it easier to identify when each message was generated. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and understanding the sequence of events in your system''s kernel log.'
        decode: '[AI] `dmesg --decode` is a Linux command used to decode and display kernel messages in a human-readable format from the system''s message buffer. The dmesg (short for ''display message'') utility shows recent kernel messages, while the `--decode` option enables interpreting and presenting hexadecimal error codes as descriptive messages, making it easier to understand the nature of issues reported by the kernel.'
        facility: '[AI] The `dmesg` command with the `--facility` option allows filtering kernel message output based on the facility or source of the message. Facility is a priority level assigned to each kernel message, indicating its origin or type (such as network, disk, or system). Using this option helps in analyzing specific types of kernel messages, reducing the noise and clutter in the output. For instance, `dmesg --facility=kernel` will display only kernel messages while `--facility=network` will show network-related messages.'
        file: '[AI] `dmesg --file` is a command used in Linux systems to display the contents of the kernel message buffer, which is a place where important system messages are logged. The option `--file` specifies that the output should be written to a file instead of being displayed on the terminal. This command can be useful for analyzing system messages stored in the buffer, especially after a system crash or when debugging issues.'
        follow: '[AI] `dmesg --follow` is a Linux command used to display the system message buffer, which contains kernel messages and other important system events. The `--follow` option enables live tracking of new messages as they are generated by the system in real-time. In summary, it''s a powerful tool for observing and debugging real-time system activity at the kernel level.'
        follow-new: '[AI] `dmesg --follow-new` is a command used in Linux systems to display the system message buffer, which contains records of recent kernel messages and events. The `--follow-new` option causes the output to be displayed in real time as new messages are added to the buffer. Essentially, it tails the kernel log in real time.'
        force-prefix: '[AI] The `dmesg` command with the `--force-prefix` option is used to display the kernel message buffer with a consistent prefix added to each message. By default, `dmesg` may not include the same prefix for every message, which can make it difficult to parse the output. The `--force-prefix` option ensures that all messages begin with a clear and consistent prefix, making it easier to identify the source and context of each kernel message.'
        help: '[AI] `dmesg --help` is a command used in Linux systems to display help information about the `dmesg` utility. This command provides an overview of the various options and their functions when using `dmesg` to view system kernel messages. Some common options include `--clear`, which clears the message buffer before displaying new messages, `--level=<level>` to filter messages based on their priority level, or `--since=<timestamp>` to show only messages that occurred after a certain timestamp. The help text also explains the default behavior of `dmesg`.'
        human: '[AI] The `dmesg --human` command is used in Linux systems to display the kernel message buffer with human-readable timestamps. The `dmesg` command itself shows the kernel messages, but by adding the `--human` option, it formats the timestamps in a way that is easier for humans to read, typically as "MMM DD HH:MM:SS". This can be helpful when analyzing system logs or troubleshooting issues.'
        kernel: '[AI] `dmesg` is a Linux command used to view the system kernel message buffer. The option `--kernel` or simply `-k` filters the output to show only messages originating from the Linux kernel. These messages include information about hardware detection, driver loading, system startup events, and other kernel activities.'
        level: '[AI] `dmesg` is a Linux command used to display system kernel messages, which are logs of events that occur during system operation. The `--level` option allows filtering of these messages based on their priority level. For instance, `dmesg --level=err` will display only error-level messages, while `dmesg --level=info` will show information-level messages. Other common levels include warning, debug, and trace. This can be useful for troubleshooting system issues or analyzing specific events.'
        noescape: '[AI] `dmesg` is a Linux command used to display the system kernel message buffer, which contains important system messages generated by hardware devices and software modules. The option `--noescape` is used to prevent the automatic escaping of special characters in the output. This means that any special characters in the messages will be displayed literally instead of being interpreted by the shell or terminal. It can be useful when analyzing kernel messages, as it makes the output easier to read and understand without having to decipher escaped sequences.'
        nopager: '[AI] `dmesg` is a Linux command used to display the system message buffer, which contains various kernel messages and notices. The option `--nopager` is used to prevent the output from being paged or formatted for easy reading in a terminal pager like `less` or `more`. Instead, the entire output will be displayed in the terminal without line wrapping or pagination. This can be useful when working with scripts or automation tools where you want to capture and parse every detail of the message buffer output.'
        notime: '[AI] `dmesg` is a Linux command used to display the system kernel message buffer. The option `--notime` tells `dmesg` not to show timestamps along with the messages. This results in a cleaner output where messages are listed one after another, making it easier to read and search for specific messages without being distracted by timestamps.'
        raw: '[AI] `dmesg --raw` is a Linux command used to display the kernel message buffer, which records system messages and events since boot time. The `--raw` option outputs the messages in their original format without any formatting or filtering. This can be useful for debugging or analyzing low-level system issues where detailed information about the messages is required.'
        read-clear: '[AI] `dmesg` is a Linux command used to display the system kernel message buffer, which contains important system messages generated by various kernel subsystems. The `--read-clear` option is not a standard flag for `dmesg`. If you meant to use `dmesg --clear` instead, this command clears the kernel message buffer after displaying its contents, allowing you to view fresh messages without having to manually clear it beforehand.'
        reltime: '[AI] `dmesg` is a Linux command used to display the system kernel message buffer. The option `--reltime` changes the time stamp format in the output to relative time, which displays the elapsed time since an event occurred instead of the absolute timestamp. This can make it easier to understand the sequence and relationship between different messages in the kernel log.'
        show-delta: '[AI] `dmesg --show-delta` is a command in Linux that displays the kernel log messages since the last reboot, with a focus on showing only the new or changed messages compared to the previous boot. This command can be useful for identifying recent system events or issues, as it filters out redundant output and focuses on the relevant information.'
        since: '[AI] `dmesg --since` is a Linux command used to display the kernel message buffer, which records various system events and messages. The `--since` option filters the output to show only the messages that occurred after a specified time, specified in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. This can be useful for troubleshooting recent system events or identifying the source of system issues.'
        syslog: '[AI] `dmesg` is a command-line utility in Linux systems used to display the kernel message buffer. The `--syslog` option filters and displays only the messages with priority equal or above the syslog level. In other words, it shows important system messages, including those related to system crashes, errors, warnings, and critical events. This can be helpful for debugging and monitoring system issues.'
        time-format: '[AI] `dmesg` is a Linux command used to display the system message buffer, which contains records of various kernel messages and events. The option `--time-format` allows users to specify the desired format for the timestamp displayed with each message. By default, `dmesg` uses the standard Linux format for timestamps (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSSSXXX), but you can change it by specifying a different format string. For example, to display timestamps in the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSSZ), use `--time-format=%F%T%z`.'
        until: '[AI] `dmesg --until` is a Linux command used to display the kernel message buffer, which contains records of system events and messages generated by the kernel since the last reboot or since a given time in the past. The option `--until` followed by a timestamp allows you to display only the messages that occurred before that specified time. This can be useful for debugging system issues or analyzing past system events.'
        userspace: '[AI] `dmesg --userspace` is a command used in Linux systems to display kernel messages that originated from user space applications, as opposed to messages generated by the kernel itself. User space refers to the part of the operating system where user programs run. By using `--userspace` option with `dmesg`, only messages related to user space events are displayed, making it useful for debugging application issues that result in kernel messages.'
        version: '[AI] The `dmesg --version` command is used to display the version information of the dmesg utility, which is a Linux command-line tool for reading and clearing the system kernel message buffer. It provides details such as the version number, compilation date, and other relevant information about the implementation of dmesg in the system.'
