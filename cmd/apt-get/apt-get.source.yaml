description: source causes apt-get to fetch source packages
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `apt-get source` is a command used in Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions to download the source code of a specific package from the repositories instead of installing it. The command retrieves the source archive, which includes the complete source code, configuration files, and build scripts. After downloading, you can extract and compile the source code locally for customization or to make modifications before building and installing the new version yourself.'
