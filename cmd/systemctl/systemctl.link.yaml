documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl link` is a command used in Linux systems to create a symbolic link (also called a "symlink" or "link target") for an existing service file, usually located under `/etc/systemd/system`. This command links the new symlink in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory with the same name as the original file but in the `/etc/systemd/enable/` directory. This is done automatically when enabling a service using the `systemctl enable` command, but the `link` command can be used manually for creating or recreating such links. Enabling a service through a symlink allows it to start during boot time without modifying its original configuration file.'
