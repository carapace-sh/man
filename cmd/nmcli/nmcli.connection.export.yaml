description: Export a connection
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `nmcli connection export` is a command used in NetworkManager to save the configuration of a specific network connection into a file. This command exports the details of the connection, such as its name, connection type (e.g., WiFi or Ethernet), authentication settings, and other relevant information in human-readable format, which can be easily edited using text editors or imported back into NetworkManager with the `nmcli connection import` command. The exported file is usually saved with a .conf extension.'
