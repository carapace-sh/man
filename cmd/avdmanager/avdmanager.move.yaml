description: Moves or renames an Android Virtual Device

    command: |-
        [AI] The `avdmanager move` command is not a standard Android Studio or AVD Manager command. There seems to be no documented use of such a command in the official Android SDK documentation. If you meant to ask about other similar commands like `avdmanager delete` or `avdmanager create`, I'd be happy to help with those instead.

        For context:

        1. `avdmanager delete`: This command is used to delete an existing AVD (Android Virtual Device) from the list of available devices in Android Studio.
        2. `avdmanager create`: This command creates a new AVD using specified configuration files or predefined templates. It's often used with XML or JSON configuration files for advanced use cases.
