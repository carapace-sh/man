documentation:
    command: '[AI] `UPX` is a portable executable compressor, or an utility used to compress and pack portable executables (PE files) and Portable Operating System Template (POSIX) binaries into smaller sizes by removing unused parts and adding compression. This makes the files harder to analyze and execute on systems without the upx tool installed. The primary goal is to make malware analysis more difficult while maintaining full functionality of the packed file.'
    flag:
        "1": '[AI] `upx` is a portable executable (PE) compressor and packer for Windows. The `-1` option is used to unpack or expand PE files compressed with UPX. When you run `upx -1 filename.exe`, it strips away the UPX packing from the specified file, making it larger in size but easier to analyze or modify.'
        "2": |-
            [AI] `upx` is a portable executable compressor for Windows. The option `-2` is used to compress an executable file using UPX v2 engine which provides a better compression ratio than the default v1 engine but may increase the decompression time slightly. This flag can be used in the command line when running `upx` with the name of the executable file as argument, for example:

            ```
            upx -2 myprogram.exe
            ```

            This command compresses `myprogram.exe` using UPX v2 engine.
        "3": '[AI] `upx` is a portable UPX executable compressor for various platforms. The option `-3` is used to apply the maximum compression level when using UPX to compress an executable file. This results in a smaller output size but may increase the time required for compression and potentially degrade the performance of the compressed file slightly due to more aggressive compression techniques being applied.'
        "4": '[AI] `upx` is a portable executable compressor for Windows. The option `-4` specifies the compression level 4, which provides a good balance between compression ratio and execution speed. It results in smaller file size compared to lower levels but may take slightly longer to decompress than lower levels during program execution.'
        "5": '[AI] `upx` is a portable Windows executable compressor. The option `-5` specifies the compression level, with higher numbers indicating more compression but also potentially greater file size bloat and longer decompression times. In this case, level 5 represents a moderate compression level that offers a balance between size reduction and decompression speed.'
        "6": '[AI] `upx` is a portable executable compressor for Windows. The option `-6` specifies the compression level with `upx`. A higher number implies more compression but also increased processing time and potentially larger decompression time. Level 6 is one of the highest compression levels supported by `upx`, resulting in smaller output size but longer compression and decompression times compared to other levels.'
        "7": '[AI] `upx` is a portable executable compressor for Windows. The option `-7` is its highest compression level, which achieves the smallest possible size when compressing an executable file using UPX. This results in a longer compression time and a slightly slower decompression speed compared to lower compression levels.'
        "8": '[AI] `upx` is a Windows utility used to compress and pack executables (EXE, DLL, etc.) with UpX packing technology. The `-8` switch is an option passed to `upx`, instructing it to use the compression level 8 for the packing process. Higher levels result in smaller output sizes but may increase the time required for packing and potentially increase the chances of detection by anti-virus software.'
        8mib-ram: '[AI] `upx --8mib-ram` is a command-line option for the UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXe) utility. This option sets the maximum RAM limit to 8 MiB when packing or compressing an executable file with UPX. In other words, it instructs UPX to optimize the packed executable to use a maximum of 8 MiB of RAM during its execution. The goal is to make the packed executable as small and memory-efficient as possible while ensuring it stays within this memory constraint.'
        8-bit: '[AI] `upx` is a portable executable (PE) compressor and packer for Windows. The option `--8-bit` is used to specify that only 8-bit code compression should be applied during the packing process. This means that only the x86 instruction set with a maximum of 256 bytes per instruction will be compressed. Using 8-bit compression can result in smaller file sizes but may lead to increased execution time and potential compatibility issues due to the complexity of modern PE files.'
        "9": '[AI] `upx` is a portable executable packer and protector for Windows. The option `-9` is used with the `upx` tool to specify the compression level for the packing process. Level 9 is the highest compression level available, meaning that the packed executable will have the smallest possible size but may take longer to decompress when run.'
        "8086": '[AI] `upx --compress 8086` is a command-line tool for the UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables) utility. It''s used to compress and pack executable files with the UPX packer, making them smaller by removing unused data and encoding the remaining parts in a more compact format. In this specific case, `--compress 8086` is an option that sets the compression level to 8086. A higher compression level results in a smaller output size but may increase the chance of compatibility issues with certain systems or antivirus software.'
        L: '[AI] `upx -L` is a command-line utility for the UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXe) toolkit. The `-L` option stands for "list modes" and is used to display available compression modes without actually compressing any files. It provides information on the supported input file types, output formats, and the specific compression algorithm used by each mode.'
        V: '[AI] `upx -V` is a command-line utility for the UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXe) tool, which is used to pack and obfuscate executable files. The `-V` flag stands for "version," so when you run `upx -V`, it displays the version information of the UPX packer being used in your system. This can help ensure that you are using a compatible version when packing or unpacking executables.'
        backup: '[AI] `upx --backup` is a command-line utility for Portable Executable (PE) files used in the UPX_PACKER packing tool. The `--backup` option creates backup files before packing, which can be useful for restoring the original file if necessary. When you pack a PE file using `upx --backup`, it generates a new file with the same name but a `.bak` extension and saves a copy of the original file with the suffix `.orig`. This feature is essential for maintaining the ability to revert to the unpacked state in case of issues after packing.'
        boot-only: '[AI] `upx --boot-only` is a command-line utility for Portable Executables (PE) files under Windows operating systems. It is used to strip or remove unnecessary DLLs and resources from an executable file, reducing its size and improving its portability. The `--boot-only` option specifically strips all non-essential DLLs from the PE file, leaving only the essential system DLLs required for the application to run at boot time. This results in a smaller executable with minimal external dependencies.'
        brute: '[AI] `upx --brute` is a tool from the Universal PackExeer (UPX) package, which is used for packing and obfuscating executable files to hide their contents and make reverse engineering more difficult. The `--brute` option is specifically used for brute-force packing, where UPX tries various packing techniques until it finds one that maximally compresses the input file without losing its functionality. This can help in evading detection by certain antivirus programs that rely on signature-based scanning. However, it may also increase the execution time and system resources required to run the packed executable.'
        coff: '[AI] `upx` is a portable executable packer and protector for Windows systems. The option `--coff` is used to create COFF (Common Object File Format) executables after packing the original executable. This format is required for certain malware analysis tools and reverse engineering environments. By using `--coff` with `upx`, you can pack your executable while maintaining its original COFF format.'
        color: '[AI] `upx --color` is a command-line utility for the UPX packer used to modify the color scheme of packed executables. When you run this command followed by the input file path, UPX will repack the file using a specified color palette, making the output file visually distinct from the original one. By default, it uses a standard gray-scale theme, but with `--color` option, you can select various predefined schemes or even provide a custom palette for a unique look.'
        compress-exports: '[AI] `upx --compress-exports` is a command-line utility for the UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXe) portable executable compressor. The `--compress-exports` option is used to strip unused imports and compress the exported functions in an executable file, resulting in smaller file size without losing functionality. It''s often employed to minimize the size of portable applications or malware, as smaller files are easier to transfer or hide.'
        compress-icons: '[AI] `upx --compress-icons` is a command-line utility for the UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXe) program, which is used to pack and compress executables and Portable Executable (PE) files. The `--compress-icons` option specifically deals with compressing icons embedded within the packed file to reduce its size. By compressing these icons, UPX can create smaller portable executables that maintain their original functionality.'
        compress-resources: '[AI] `upx --compress-resources` is a command-line utility from the UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXe) packaging tool. This option is used to compress embedded resources in executable files, reducing their size. When you pack an executable with this flag, UPX analyzes and compresses various types of resources, such as icons, bitmaps, strings, and other data, making the packed file smaller. This is often useful for distributing portable applications or reducing the footprint of malware.'
        d: '[AI] `upx -d` is a command-line utility used in portable executable (PE) file manipulation, specifically with UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXe). The `-d` flag stands for "decompress" or "depack". When you run `upx -d <filename>`, it decrypts and decompresses any packaged PE files within the specified file. This results in unpacked executables that can be analyzed or executed with ease.'
        f: '[AI] `upx` is a portable executable (PE) packer for Windows. The option `-f` stands for "force rebuild." When used with this flag, `upx` will forcefully recompile and repack the input file without checking if it has already been packed or not. This can be useful when dealing with files that have failed to be packed correctly or when trying to repack a file after making modifications to its code.'
        h: '[AI] `upx` is a portable executable packer for Windows. The option `-h` or `--help` displays the help message when used with the command, providing information about the available commands and their usage. It helps users understand how to use the `upx` tool effectively.'
        keep-resource: '[AI] `upx --keep-resource` is a command-line utility used in Portable Executable (PE) file manipulation, specifically when dealing with UPX packer. It''s an option for the `upx` tool that prevents UPX from removing or renaming resources during the packing process. In other words, it keeps original resource names and structures intact while compressing and protecting the PE file against reverse engineering.'
        l: '[AI] `upx` is a portable executable packer and compressor for Windows. The command `upx -l` is used to list the packed files, displaying their original size, new size after packing, and compression ratio. It provides information about which parts of each file have been compressed or encrypted without actually extracting the contents.'
        le: '[AI] `upx --le` is a command-line utility for Portable Executable (PE) files under Windows operating systems. The `--le` option stands for "List Expenses." This command displays detailed information about the resources each DLL or executable file uses, including the size of the resource and the import/export addresses. It helps analyze the memory usage and dependencies of PE files.'
        mono: '[AI] `upx --mono` is a command-line utility used in the UPX packaging system. This specific command instructs UPX to create a portable executable (PE) file for a Windows application, with the Mono runtime environment embedded inside. In simpler terms, it packages an application along with the required Mono libraries into a single executable file.'
        no-align: '[AI] `upx --no-align` is a command-line tool used in Windows for portable executables (PE files). The `--no-align` option instructs UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXe) to pack the PE file without alignment adjustments. This means that UPX will not modify the entry point or base address of the packed file, preserving the original file''s structure and ensuring compatibility with specific environments. By default, UPX aligns the code and data segments in a PE file to improve its packing efficiency, but this might cause issues in some cases where exact addresses are required.'
        no-backup: |-
            [AI] `upx --no-backup` is a command-line utility for the UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXe) program. This specific command tells UPX not to create backup files when packing an executable.

            When you run `upx <file>`, UPX compresses and packs the specified executable file, making it smaller and harder to reverse-engineer or analyze. By adding `--no-backup`, you instruct UPX to overwrite the original file without creating a backup copy before packing, which simplifies the process but also means there's no way to recover the unpacked original file easily if needed.
        no-color: '[AI] `upx --no-color` is a command-line utility for Portable Executable (PE) files under Windows operating systems. The `--no-pack` option is used to disable UPX packing, while the `--no-color` option disables colored output when using UPX. This can be useful when running scripts or in automated environments where colorized output may not be desired or supported.'
        no-progress: '[AI] `upx --no-progress` is a command-line option for the UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXe) utility, which is used to compress and pack executables and binaries to reduce their size and make them more portable. The `--no-progress` flag disables progress output during the packing process. This can be useful when running automated scripts or batch processes where unnecessary progress messages might clutter the output.'
        no-reloc: |-
            [AI] `upx --no-reloc` is a command-line utility used in the UPX Packer project to pack and obfuscate executable files. The `--no-reloc` option specifically tells UPX not to modify relocations during the packing process.

            Relocations are memory addresses referenced by instructions in an executable file that need to be adjusted when the file is loaded into memory. Modifying relocations is necessary in some cases, for example, if functions or data are being moved within the packed executable. However, keeping original relocations can make the packing process faster and simpler, especially for small executables.

            Using `--no-reloc` option results in a packed executable that retains its original relocations, making it easier to load and run, but potentially less effective at hiding its internal structure from reverse engineering attempts.
        o: '[AI] `upx -o` is a command-line utility for Portable Executable (PE) files used in the UPX packing tool. This option, `-o`, stands for "output" or "outfile." When you use `upx -o output_filename input_file`, it packs `input_file` with UPX and saves the resulting packed executable as `output_filename`.'
        overlay: '[AI] `upx --overlay` is a command-line tool for the UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXe) utility used for executable packing and obfuscation. The `--overlay` option is used to apply an overlay, which is a data file containing instructions to modify or replace specific parts of an executable''s code. This can be useful for applying patches, encryption keys, or custom modifications to the packed executable without altering its original structure or size. The result is a smaller and stealthier packed executable.'
        preserve-build-id: '[AI] `upx --preserve-build-id` is a command-line option for the UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXe) utility. It''s used when packing executables to preserve their original build identifiers, which are unique strings generated during the build process of an application. This option ensures that the packed executable retains its original build identifier instead of being replaced with a new one during the packing process. Preserving build identifiers is useful for maintaining version control and tracking software updates or modifications.'
        q: '[AI] `upx` is a portable Windows and Unix executable packer. The `-q` option is used with it to specify quiet mode. In this mode, `upx` runs without displaying any progress bars or status messages during the packing process. This can be useful if you prefer to run `upx` in the background or automate its usage without interruptions from console output.'
        strip-relocs: '[AI] `upx --strip-relocs` is a command-line utility from the UPX Packer project. It''s used to strip relocations (memory addresses adjustments) from executables and DLLs, making them smaller in size and portable across different systems without requiring specific external libraries. This can be useful for creating portable applications or malware stealth. The `--strip-relocs` option specifically instructs UPX to perform this operation.'
        t: '[AI] `upx -t` is a command-line utility for the UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXe) package, which is used to pack and compress executable files to make them smaller and harder to reverse engineer. The `-t` option stands for "test mode". When used with this option, `upx` will not actually pack the file but instead will display information about the available packing options for that specific executable. This can be helpful for understanding which settings are best for effectively reducing the size of a given executable while minimizing any potential negative impact on its functionality.'
        ultra-brute: '[AI] `upx --ultra-brute` is a command-line tool used for packing and obfuscating executable files, primarily used to protect Portable Executable (PE) files from reverse engineering and analysis. The term "ultra-brute" suggests that this is an advanced or extreme version of UPX, providing stronger protection against various forms of analysis. The packed file maintains the original PE file''s functionality but alters its structure and code to make it harder to understand, ensuring increased security.'
        v: '[AI] `upx` is a portable Windows and Linux executable packer. The `-v` flag is used with `upx` to enable verbose mode. In this mode, `upx` provides detailed information about the files it processes, including the name of each file, the compression method used, and the resulting size reduction achieved. This flag helps in understanding what `upx` does to the files during the packing process.'
