documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tmux choose-tree` is a TMUX command used to interactively select and attach to a detached session from the list of available sessions in the TMUX server. It displays a tree view of the sessions with their respective window titles, enabling users to easily navigate and select the desired session using the arrow keys or numbered menu. Once selected, the chosen session is attached, bringing its windows back to the terminal.'
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `tmux choose-tree -F` is a command in TMUX, the terminal multiplexer, used to display and interactively select among available sessions or windows. The `-F` option modifies the format of output, allowing users to customize the displayed information. This command does not create or manage new sessions or windows but rather provides an interface for selecting among existing ones based on the given format string.'
        K: '[AI] `tmux choose-tree` is a tmux command used to interactively select a session or window in a tree view. The option `-K` specifies the key binding for this command, which by default is `prefix +c`. When using `choose-tree -K <key>`, you''re customizing the keybinding to be `<key>` instead. So, the whole command `tmux choose-tree -K <key>` sets up the "choose-tree" behavior with the specified key as its binding.'
        O: '[AI] `tmux choose-tree -O` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to display a tree view of attached sessions and windows. The `-O` option modifies the output format of the tree view. By default, it shows session names followed by window titles. However, with `-O`, you can customize the output to show additional or different information like session ids, creation time, or the number of panes in each window. This command does not open a new pane or window but instead displays the tree view on the current terminal.'
        f: '[AI] `tmux choose-tree` is a Tmux command used to display a tree view of attached sessions and windows. The `-f` option stands for "force" or "full" mode. In this mode, the output of the command includes additional details such as session names, window titles, and the status of each window (detached or attached). So, `tmux choose-tree -f` will display a tree with full information about sessions and windows.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux choose-tree -t` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to display and interactively select a tree of attached sessions or windows. The "-t" option specifies that the output should be presented as a tree structure instead of a list. This command helps users manage complex Tmux sessions with multiple levels of sessions and windows by allowing them to easily navigate through and select specific sessions or windows using the tree interface.'
