    command: '[AI] The `pwd` command is short for "print working directory." It is a common command used in Unix-based operating systems to display the current working directory of the terminal or shell session. When executed, it prints out the full path of the current directory to the terminal.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `pwd` is a command in Unix-based operating systems used to print the present working directory, that is, the current directory of the user. The option `--help` is used to display detailed help information about the `pwd` command. This includes usage instructions, a list of available options and their meanings, and other relevant information. It''s a quick way for users to learn how to use the command effectively.'
        logical: '[AI] The `pwd` (Print Working Directory) command with the `--logical` option in Unix-based systems displays the full hierarchical path of the current directory, using only slash (/) symbols to separate directories, without showing the current directory name at the end. This format is also known as the "logical" or "absolute" path. For example: `/home/user/Documents`.'
        physical: '[AI] The `pwd` (print working directory) command with the `--physical` option is used in Unix-like operating systems to print the absolute physical path of the current working directory, without any symbolic links being followed. In other words, it displays the actual file system path leading to the current directory, not any shortcuts or aliases represented by symbolic links.'
        version: '[AI] The `pwd` command with the `--version` option is used to display the version information of the `pwd` (print working directory) utility itself, rather than the current working directory. When executed with this option, it will output the `pwd` utility''s name, version number, and sometimes additional information like compilation date and operating system.'
