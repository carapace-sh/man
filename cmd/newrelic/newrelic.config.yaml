description: Manage the configuration of the New Relic CLI
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `newrelic config` command is used with New Relic agents to modify configuration settings for applications being monitored. It can be run locally on a machine where an agent is installed or remotely using an SSH connection. The exact usage and available options depend on the specific New Relic agent and its version. Generally, it takes the form of `newrelic config <option> [<value>]`, where `<option>` represents the configuration setting to change and `<value>` is the new value for that setting. For example: `newrelic config appname myAppName`. It''s recommended checking New Relic documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information on the use of this command with your specific agent version.'
