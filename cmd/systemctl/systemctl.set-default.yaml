documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl set-default` is a command used in Linux systems with systemd initialization system. It allows setting the default runlevel or target for the system at boot time. The default target determines which unit files are started automatically when the system starts up. For example, `sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target` sets the system to boot into a multi-user mode by default, whereas `sudo systemctl set-default emergency.target` sets the system to boot into an emergency mode (only essential services are started). The change takes effect after the next reboot.'
