documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `adb mdns services` command is used with Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to register or query Multicast DNS (mDNS) services. mDNS allows devices to discover each other and share services over a local network without the need for centralized configuration. This command can be used to list currently registered mDNS services, or to register a new service with a given name and port. For instance, `adb shell am start -n com.example.app/.MainActivity --mdns` can be followed by `adb shell mdns_register_service "example.local" 80`, in order to register an mDNS service with the name "example.local" and port 80 for an app package named "com.example.app".'
