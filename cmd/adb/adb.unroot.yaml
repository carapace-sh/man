documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) command `adb unroot` is used to remove root access on an Android device. It revokes root privileges by disabling Superuser access and resetting the SU binary to its stock version. This command should be run from a computer with `adb` installed, connected to the Android device via USB. Note that the effectiveness of this command depends on the specific implementation of root access on the device. In some cases, additional steps may be required to completely remove root access.'
