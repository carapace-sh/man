    command: '[AI] The `tsh clusters` command is used in Tenable''s SecurityCenter Continuous View (CV) platform to display information about the clusters of assets or systems being monitored. A cluster is a grouping of assets that share common characteristics, such as operating system, location, or vulnerability status. This command helps security administrators to easily manage and analyze security data for large numbers of assets by providing an overview of the distribution and statuses within each cluster.'
    flag:
        format: '[AI] `tsh clusters --format` is a command used in Tsung, an open-source load testing tool. This command is used to display cluster statistics in a customizable format. The `--format` option allows specifying the desired output format using a template language. For instance, you might use `"%{ClusterName} %{ClientsCount}"` to show the cluster name and number of connected clients. The output can be redirected to a file or displayed in the terminal for further processing.'
        no-quiet: '[AI] `tsh` is a command-line tool for managing Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) clusters. The command `tsh clusters --no-quiet` lists information about all detected Elastic Stack clusters in the system without suppressing any output. The `--no-quiet` flag is used to prevent the tool from running quietly or in silent mode, meaning it will display all available information instead of just errors or critical messages.'
        quiet: '[AI] `tsh clusters` is a command in Tsung, an open-source load testing tool. The option `--quiet` is used to suppress or limit the output of the command. In this specific case, it means that the command will run with minimal output, showing only essential information related to the execution of the clusters management task.'
