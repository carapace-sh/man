description: Experimental features (may change or be removed in the future)
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "terramate experimental" command is specific to TerraForm, an open-source infrastructure configuration management tool by HashiCorp. This command is used to execute TerraForm plans in experimental mode. In experimental mode, TerraForm enables the execution of new features or changes that have not been fully tested and may introduce errors or instability. By using this command, users can opt to use these new features even if they are not yet released as stable versions. It''s essential to note that experimental features might not be compatible with previous Terraform configurations, and their behavior could change between different releases. Always exercise caution when using experimental features in production environments.'
