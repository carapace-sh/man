documentation:
    command: '[AI] CURA (pronounced "cue-rah") is a popular open-source 3D printing software used to slice and prepare digital models for additive manufacturing. It converts 3D model files into machine instructions that your specific 3D printer can understand, optimizing settings such as layer height, infill density, support structures, and print speed to produce the best possible result with minimal material waste.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] The `--debug` flag for the Cura open-source 3D printing slicing software initiates a more detailed and verbose logging mode during the slicing process. This enhanced output includes additional diagnostic and debugging information that can be useful for identifying and resolving complex printing issues or for developers to understand the internal workings of Cura. By providing this extensive log data, it enables a deeper level of problem analysis and potential customization of the software for specific use cases.'
        external-backend: |-
            [AI] The `--external-backend` flag in Cura, a popular open-source 3D printing slicing software, is used to specify an external application or library for handling certain functions that Cura does not support natively or for which the user prefers an alternative solution.

            By providing an external backend with this flag, Cura can delegate specific tasks, such as advanced simulation or material properties analysis, to the specified tool. This setup allows users to extend the capabilities of Cura beyond its default functionality and can lead to improved accuracy, efficiency, or customization in their 3D printing workflows.
        headless: '[AI] `cura --headless` is a command-line option for Cura, an open-source 3D printing software. The `--headless` option runs Cura in the background without a user interface. It''s commonly used for automating and controlling prints remotely or integrating Cura into other systems like build servers or custom control panels. This allows for unattended prints, scripting, and API interactions.'
        help: '[AI] `cura --help` is a command used in Cura, an open-source 3D printing software. This command displays detailed help information about Cura and its various features and options. The output includes usage instructions, a list of available commands, and brief descriptions for each one. It''s an essential tool for users who want to explore the full potential of Cura or need to troubleshoot issues.'
        single-instance: '[AI] The `--single-instance` flag for the Cura print slicing software is used to ensure that only one instance of Cura is running on a system at a time. When this option is enabled, Cura checks if another instance is already running and, if so, prevents a new instance from being started. This can be useful in scenarios where multiple instances of Cura might interfere with each other or cause unnecessary resource usage.'
        version: '[AI] The `curl --version` command is used to display version information about the installed CURL (Client for URLs) utility, which is a popular command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server using various protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SFTP, etc. When executed with this flag, it will print out detailed information including the version number, compilation options, and other relevant details about CURL''s build configuration.'
