documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `go work` init command is used with GoMod, a new dependency management system in Go starting from Go version 1.11. This command initializes a new GoMod workspace by creating a go.mod file at the root level of the project directory and setting up the required subdirectories for source code and cache. It also sets the Go Mod mode to "vendoring" or "module-required" in the go.sum file, depending on the project''s requirements. This command is important for managing dependencies effectively within a Go project.'
