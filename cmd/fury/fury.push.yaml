        [AI] The command "fury push" is not a standard or widely used command in common software development tools like Git or SVN. It seems to be specific to a tool called Fury, which is a continuous integration and deployment platform for Ruby applications.

        With Fury, the "push" command is likely used to deploy new code changes to a production environment. When you run "fury push", Fury checks your repository for new commits, builds your application, runs tests, and then deploys the updated code if everything passes. This helps ensure that only verified, functioning code makes it to your live site.
    flag:
        public: '[AI] `fury push --public` is a command used in Fury, a Git-like version control system for Docker images. This command pushes a local image to a public registry or container repository, making it accessible to anyone with the URL of the image. The flag `--public` signifies that the image should be marked as publicly available and not require authentication to access.'
        quiet: '[AI] `fury push --quiet` is a command used in Fury Git Client, which pushes local changes to the remote repository without displaying any output or progress messages. The `--quiet` option suppresses any verbose output during the operation.'
