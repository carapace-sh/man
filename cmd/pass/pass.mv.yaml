documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pass mv` command is not a standard Linux or Unix command, but rather a part of the `GnuPG` (GNU Privacy Guard) suite used for managing and encrypting files. It''s an alias for the `gpg --edit-keys --trust-upgrade <keyid> mv <source_keyid> <destination_keyid>` command. This command moves a trust value between keys in a GnuPG keyring, allowing users to update and manage their trust settings.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The command `mv --force` is used in Unix-based operating systems for force moving or renaming files and directories. The `--force` option instructs `mv` to overwrite existing files without asking for confirmation and move hidden and protected files, even if they are read-only. It''s often used when you want to replace a file with the same name in its destination without any prompts or warnings.'
