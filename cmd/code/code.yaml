    command: |-
        [AI] The `code` command is not a universal or commonly used command in computing as it can mean different things depending on the context. Here are a few possibilities:

        1. In Visual Studio Code or other integrated development environments (IDEs), `code .` opens the current directory in that IDE.
        2. In Git, `git code` is an alias for `git blast-diff`, which shows a more detailed difference viewer for two branches.
        3. In some programming languages or frameworks like Python's IPython or RStudio, `code` might be used as a shorthand to open the source file in the associated IDE or editor.
        4. There is also Microsoft Code, a web-based integrated development environment that can be accessed with the command `code <file_or_project_url>`.

        So, without more context it's hard to definitively explain what the `code` command does.
    flag:
        add: '[AI] `code --add` is a command used in Visual Studio Code''s integrated source control management (like Git). It adds or stages files for commitment in the next Git commit without modifying the Git index or making a commit yet. This allows developers to prepare their changes for committing, review them and make any final adjustments before actually committing the code.'
        category: '[AI] The `flag --category` is a command-line option used in various programs, particularly those written in programming languages like Go or Rust, to specify a particular category or grouping for a given flag. For instance, when using a CLI tool, you may set multiple flags with the same category to keep them organized and easily manageable within the application''s configuration. The exact implementation can vary between different tools, but the main purpose remains the same: facilitating efficient categorization of related flags.'
        diff: '[AI] `git diff --cached` or `git diff --staged` is a Git command used to show the differences between the files that are staged for the next commit and the last committed version. The changes are displayed in a text format, highlighting the additions (+), deletions (-), and modifications (~) within the file. This command does not make any changes to your repository; it just shows you what will be committed if you run `git commit`.'
        disable-extension: '[AI] The `--disable-extension` flag is a command-line option for Google Chrome''s developer tools when using the `chrome devtools --remote` command to connect to a remote browser instance. This flag is used to disable all installed extensions in that instance, providing a clean environment for debugging and testing web applications without interference from extensions.'
        disable-extensions: '[AI] The `--disable-extensions` flag in Chrome DevTools''s Command Line API disables all extensions in the browser. It''s a way to test and debug web applications without interference from installed extensions. When passed as an argument to the `--new-window`, `--remote-debugging-port` or similar commands, it ensures that the new browser instance will start with no extensions enabled.'
        disable-gpu: |-
            [AI] The `--disable-gpu` flag is a command-line argument used with Google Chrome's `chrome` or Chromium browser executables. This flag disables the use of the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) acceleration for rendering web pages, which can be useful in certain situations such as:

            1. Debugging WebGL or graphics issues: Disabling GPU acceleration can help in isolating and diagnosing problems related to web graphics and WebGL.
            2. Running Chrome on older or resource-constrained systems: Older or underpowered computers may struggle with the heavy graphical demands of modern websites, so disabling GPU acceleration could make the browser run more smoothly.
            3. Accessibility: In some cases, disabling GPU acceleration might improve accessibility for certain users with visual impairments or other disabilities.
            4. Security and privacy: Some argue that disabling GPU acceleration can enhance security and privacy by reducing potential attack vectors related to graphics rendering and WebGL.

            Keep in mind that disabling GPU acceleration may result in slower rendering performance, especially on modern webpages with heavy graphics or animations.
        enable-proposed-api: '[AI] The `--enable-proposed-api` flag is a command-line option used with Google''s Angular CLI for creating and building Angular projects. It enables the use of experimental, proposed APIs in the Angular platform. These APIs are not part of the stable Angular API but may offer new features or improvements. By enabling them, developers can try out these innovative functionalities in their projects, although they come with the risk of potential instability and backward compatibility issues. The flag is typically used when starting a new project with `ng new`, but it can also be applied to existing projects using `ng set projects.<project-name>.schematics.@angular/cli.json enableProposedAPIs true`.'
        extensions-dir: '[AI] `flag --extensions-dir` is a command-line option used in tools like Go and Rust compilers. It specifies a directory containing custom file extension handlers or plugins. When this flag is set, the compiler will look for extensions in that directory to extend its functionality beyond the default capabilities. This allows users to expand the range of file types or add new features to their development workflow.'
        goto: '[AI] The `--goto` flag is a command-line option for Git, a popular version control system. It allows users to jump directly to a specific commit by providing its hash or branch name. This can be useful when working with large repositories or when navigating between commits quickly. For example, `git checkout --goto <commit-hash>` will checkout the specified commit, and `git reset --hard --goto <commit-hash>` will reset the HEAD to that commit. Note that using this flag requires careful consideration as it bypasses the normal checking mechanisms of Git and can result in data loss if used incorrectly.'
        help: '[AI] `flag "code" --help` is a command used in various CLI (Command Line Interface) tools, including Go''s `go` tool and Azure DevOps Extension SDK''s `code` command. It requests for help or usage information about the given flag named ''code''. When executed, it displays detailed explanations of what the flag does, any related arguments it accepts, and examples of how to use it effectively in the command.'
        inspect-brk-extensions: '[AI] The `--inspect-brk-extensions` flag is used with Google Chrome''s DevTools debugging mode (`code:cmd "Chrome --remote-debug-port=9222" --autostart="your_page.html"`) when working with Node.js applications. This flag enables the use of Breakpoint and Source Maps extensions for inspecting and debugging remote Node.js sources, allowing developers to pause execution, step through code, and set conditional breakpoints as they would in native Chrome applications.'
        inspect-extensions: '[AI] `code --inspect-extensions` is a command used in Visual Studio Code, an integrated development environment (IDE) by Microsoft. This command allows users to inspect and manage installed extensions without actually opening or interacting with the IDE graphically. It provides detailed information about each extension such as the publisher, version number, installation path, and enabled/disabled status. It''s useful for programmatically checking the installed extensions in a non-interactive environment or scripting operations related to extensions.'
        install-extension: |-
            [AI] `code --install-extension` is a command used in Visual Studio Code, a popular source code editor developed by Microsoft. This command is used to install an extension into VSCode locally on your machine. The syntax of the command is as follows:

            ```bash
            code --install-extension <ExtensionID>
            ```

            Replace `<ExtensionID>` with the unique identifier or the publisher name and extension name, for example, `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` or `ms-python.python`. Running this command in your terminal or command prompt will download and install the specified extension into your Visual Studio Code installation.
        list-extensions: '[AI] `code --list-extensions` is a command used in Visual Studio Code, an integrated development environment (IDE) by Microsoft. This command displays a list of installed extensions in the editor. It helps developers to easily identify and manage the set of extensions that are currently active in their workspace, enabling them to keep track of their tools and maintain an optimal development environment.'
        locale: '[AI] The `--locale` option in the `code` command is used to specify the desired locale or regional settings for output generated by the command. This can include things like language, region, and character encodings. For example, `code --locale en-US` would set the output to use English (United States) locale settings. This can be useful when working with codebases that contain text in different languages or regional formats, as it ensures that the tools used to edit and view the code display it correctly.'
        log: |-
            [AI] The `--log` flag in various command-line tools, including Git's `code` command, is used to enable and configure log output. It modifies how the tool records and displays its logs. The exact behavior might depend on the specific tool, but generally, it can be used to:

            1. Enable logging (when it's off by default): `--log`.
            2. Redirect logs to a file instead of stdout: `--logfile <filename>` or `--log > <filename>`.
            3. Use custom formats for log messages: `--logformat <format>`.
            4. Control the verbosity level (amount and detail of information shown): `--loglevel <level>`, where levels can be TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, or ERROR.

            These flags help provide more visibility into what a command does when executed, making it useful for debugging and troubleshooting.
        max-memory: '[AI] The `--max-memory` option in Kubernetes'' `kubectl apply` or `kubectl create` commands is used to limit the amount of memory that a container in a pod can use during its execution. This flag helps prevent containers from requesting or using more memory than allocated by the cluster, which can lead to resource contention and performance issues. By setting an appropriate value for this flag, you can ensure that your application runs efficiently within the available resources without causing out-of-memory errors or other related issues.'
        new-window: '[AI] The `--new-window` flag is used with the Git command line tool, specifically with the `git clone` or `git checkout` commands. When this option is provided, a new terminal window or tab will be opened in your default terminal emulator or web browser respectively, to run the Git command and display its output. This can be useful when working on multiple branches or repositories simultaneously without having to constantly switch between windows or tabs in a single terminal session.'
        prof-startup: '[AI] `code --prof-startup` is a command for the Visual Studio Code integrated development environment (IDE) that starts profiling sessions for collecting performance data at application startup. This information can help identify bottlenecks and optimize the code for better performance. The profiler gathers statistics on functions, modules, and memory usage during the initialization phase of the application.'
        reuse-window: '[AI] The `--reuse-window` flag is a command-line option used with Docker''s `docker-compose` tool. It instructs Docker to reuse existing networks, containers, and volumes if they already exist with the same names instead of creating new ones. This can be helpful in reducing resource usage and improving performance when you are making repeated builds or changes to your application without modifying the infrastructure. The flag promotes consistency, efficiency, and compatibility within the Docker environment.'
        show-versions: '[AI] `flag "code" --show-versions` is a command or option used in various software development tools and packages, including Go and Helm, to display the versions of installed or applied components. When executed, it will output the specific versions of the codebase or dependencies that are currently being used. This can be helpful for debugging issues, ensuring compatibility between different parts of a system, or maintaining an accurate record of the software stack.'
        status: '[AI] `flag "code" --status` is a command used in various tools and applications, particularly in continuous integration and deployment systems like GitLab CI/CD or Jenkins. This command''s purpose is to retrieve the current status or result of the specified job, build, or pipeline that has been run with the given code flag. It provides information such as success or failure, the time taken to complete, and often a link to view more detailed logs or artifacts. In essence, it allows users to quickly check the recent history and outcomes of their automated code processes.'
        sync: '[AI] `flag --sync` is a command-line option used in some software development tools, typically version control systems like Git. It signifies a request to perform a synchronization of local and remote repositories or branches. In other words, it fetches any new commits or changes from the remote repository and merges them into the local one, ensuring that the local repository is up-to-date with the latest version of the project.'
        telemetry: '[AI] The `--telemetry` flag in the context of Azure DevOps Pipelines refers to enabling telemetry data collection. Telemetry data is diagnostic information automatically collected by Azure Devops, which helps improve performance and provides useful insights for troubleshooting and optimization. When using this flag, additional data about the pipeline run will be transmitted to Microsoft''s servers for analysis. It may include details like pipeline definition, environment variables, and execution status, among others.'
        uninstall-extension: '[AI] The command `code --uninstall-extension` is used to uninstall an extension in Visual Studio Code. The "--uninstall-extension" option is passed to the `code` command, which is the command-line interface for Visual Studio Code. The argument following this option specifies the identifier or name of the extension to be uninstalled. This command runs on a local machine and removes the specified extension from the user''s installation of Visual Studio Code, without requiring an internet connection or visiting the extensions marketplace.'
        user-data-dir: '[AI] `flag --user-data-dir` is a command line option used in various applications, particularly those based on Chromium project such as Google Chrome and Chromium browser. This flag sets the custom directory path for storing user-specific data like bookmarks, extensions, cache, and other settings, instead of using the default system location. It''s helpful when dealing with multiple users or wanting to keep data separate across different installations.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `--verbose` flag is a command-line option used in various programs, including coding tools like Compilers and Interpreters. It''s designed to increase the amount of output or detail provided during program execution. By using this flag with a command like `code --verbose`, you are instructing the code tool to display more information about the processes it is performing. This can be useful for debugging, understanding complex workflows, and gaining insights into underlying system behaviors. However, keep in mind that excessive verbosity might also generate noise and slow down the execution time.'
        version: '[AI] `flag "code" --version` is a command used in various software development tools, such as Go or Helm, to check for the version of the specific tool being installed and configured on the system. When run, it will print out the version number and other relevant information, like the build date and commit hash, helping users ensure they have the latest version or troubleshoot issues related to version compatibility.'
        wait: '[AI] The `flag --wait` in the context of programming is used to make a Go program block and wait for a specific condition or event to occur before continuing execution. It is typically used with other flags or commands that trigger an asynchronous process, such as sending an HTTP request or starting a long-running task. By using `--wait`, the Go program will pause and not return control until the specified condition is met, ensuring that other parts of the application do not continue before the previous task has completed.'
