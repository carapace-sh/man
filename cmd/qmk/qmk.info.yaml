documentation:
    command: '[AI] `qmk info` is a command used in the Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware (QMK) project to display various useful information about the current QMK project setup. It shows details such as the active branch or commit hash, the board and layout being used, the configuration file location, and other relevant build-related data. This command can be helpful for debugging issues or simply for confirming the correctness of your QMK environment.'
    flag:
        ascii: '[AI] `qmk info --ascii` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project. This command generates an ASCII art representation of the keyboard layout, including key names and symbols. The output can be easily visualized in text editors or terminal windows, making it useful for sharing and discussing keyboard configurations without requiring graphic tools or physical keyboards.'
        format: '[AI] `qmk info --format` is a command in QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard), an open-source keyboard firmware. This command generates output in a specified format, providing various information about the current QMK project such as its layout, version, features, and built-in keycodes. The specific format can be chosen using flags or by creating a custom format file. The generated output is intended for developers and users to understand the configuration of their QMK keyboard projects.'
        help: '[AI] `qmk info --help` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project to display help information about the `info` sub-command. This command provides details on various options that can be used with the `info` command to gather specific information about the QMK project or a particular keyboard layout or firmware configuration. Options include displaying build status, keyboard model information, and list of available features and their current settings.'
        keyboard: '[AI] The `qmk info --keyboard` command is used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware to display detailed information about a specific keyboard configuration. When executed, it prints out various metadata about the keyboard such as its name, layout, MCU (microcontroller), version, and other relevant details. This information can be useful for debugging or for verifying that the correct keyboard configuration is being used.'
        keymap: '[AI] `qmk info --keymap` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware. This command provides detailed information about the currently selected keymap in the QMK configuration. The output includes details such as the name of the keymap, its version number, the layout type, and a list of keys and their corresponding functions. It helps keyboard builders, developers, and users to understand the mapping of keys in their customized keyboards using QMK firmware.'
        layouts: '[AI] `qmk info --layouts` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware. It provides information about the defined keyboard layouts within the current QMK project. The output includes the name, description, and layer assignments for each layout, helping users understand the various configurations available for their custom keyboards.'
        matrix: '[AI] The `qmk info --matrix` command is used within the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project to display the layout and assignment information of a keyboard''s matrix, which is the grid of switches that detects key presses. The output shows rows (R) and columns (C), the names or numbers of each switch, and their default functions or keys assigned within QMK.'
        rules-mk: '[AI] `qmk info --rules-mk` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project to display information about the rules files and the Makefile configuration. It generates an output showing the included rulefiles, their targets, dependencies, and the resulting actions that will be performed during the build process. This command helps in understanding how the various parts of the QMK project are assembled into a functional keyboard firmware.'
