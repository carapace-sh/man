documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "waypoint artifact" is a concept in GPS navigation systems, specifically in routing or mission planning for autonomous vehicles or drones. A waypoint is a specific geographic location defined by its coordinates, and an artifact is data associated with that waypoint. In this context, the term "waypoint artifact" refers to any additional information linked to a particular waypoint, such as instructions, tasks, or data, which can be used to modify or enhance the navigation between waypoints in a route. It may include things like altitude constraints, time windows, or payload release commands for drops at a given location.'
