documentation:
    command: '[AI] `zoxide query` is a command used in the Zsh terminal autocompletion tool, Zoxide. It allows users to search for directory completions based on given text. For instance, if you type `cd.. query path`, it will display a list of directories that match the text "path" within the current hierarchy. This can help in navigating complex file systems more efficiently.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `zoxide query --all` is a command used in the Zsh terminal autocompleter called Zoxide. This command retrieves suggestions for completions from all visible directories and files in the current terminal session. The `--all` flag tells Zoxide to include both directories and files in the suggestion list, providing more comprehensive options for the user.'
        exclude: '[AI] `zoxide query --exclude` is a command used in the zoxide fuzzy file finder tool. The `--exclude` option allows users to specify one or more glob patterns to exclude from search results. This can be useful for ignoring files or directories that are not relevant to a particular query. For example, `zoxide query --exclude=".git/*"` would exclude all files and directories matching the `.git` pattern from the search results.'
        help: '[AI] `zoxide query --help` is a command used with the Zoxide tool, which is a fuzzy finder for the terminal that can search through directories and files. The `--help` flag is an option to display detailed help information about this specific command, `query`. When you run `zoxide query --help`, it will show you the various options and their descriptions for using the query feature of Zoxide. This can include things like search filters, case sensitivity, and more. It''s a quick way to familiarize yourself with how to effectively use the query function to find files or directories in your system.'
        interactive: '[AI] `zoxide query --interactive` is a command used in the Zsh terminal autocompletion tool called Zoxide. This command initiates an interactive query session where you can type a partial path or filename and receive suggestions in real-time as you type. The suggested completions are dynamically generated based on the files and directories in your current file system. It''s particularly useful for navigating complex directory structures quickly and efficiently.'
        list: '[AI] `zoxide query --list` is a command used in Zsh''s fuzzy file finder, zoxide. This command lists all matches found for the current query in the filesystem without opening any files or performing further actions on them. It simply displays the file paths as output options. The user can then navigate and select the desired file using the keyboard or other input methods.'
        score: '[AI] `zoxide query --score` is a command from Zoxide, a fuzzy file finder for zsh, bash, and other shells. This command searches for files based on the given query term and then returns the matching files sorted by their score, which reflects how closely each file name matches the query term. The higher the score, the closer the match. This can help users quickly locate specific files among many candidates.'
        version: '[AI] `zoxide query --version` is a command used with the Zoxide fuzzy file finder tool to check and display its current version number. It''s typically run in a terminal or command prompt, providing users with information about the specific version of Zoxide they have installed, allowing them to keep track of updates and ensure compatibility with other software.'
