        [AI] `glab` is a Git interface tool for working with remote repositories and issues, specifically designed for GitLab users. The `issue delete` command is used to delete an issue from a specific GitLab project. Here's how it works:

        1. First, you need to authenticate with your GitLab account using `glab login` or by setting up your SSH keys.
        2. Navigate to the local directory containing the Git repository of the project with the issue you want to delete.
        3. Run `glab issue list` to view a list of issues in the current project.
        4. Identify the issue number you want to delete and run `glab issue delete <issue-number>`. This command deletes the specified issue from your local Git repository, but does not affect the original issue on GitLab until you push your changes.
        5. To confirm the deletion and push the change to the remote GitLab repository, run `git push origin <branch-name>` (replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch containing the deleted issue). This will update the project's history on GitLab with the deletion.
