documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flatpak list` is a command used in the Flatpak packaging system to display information about installed applications and their versions. When run without any options, it lists all installed applications with their respective architectures, branches, installations directories, and installation dates. It provides a quick overview of the currently active Flatpak applications on your system.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `flatpak list --all` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to list all installed applications and their related information, including their names, versions, vendors, and branches or repositories where they were installed. It shows a comprehensive view of all installed software on a system using the Flatpak packaging format.'
        app: '[AI] `flatpak list --app` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to list installed applications and their details. The output shows each application''s name, version, branch, and runtime. This command helps users to easily check which applications are currently installed and their corresponding information on the system.'
        app-runtime: '[AI] The `flatpak list --app-runtime` command is used to list all installed application runtimes in Flatpak, a popular software deployment and package management system for Linux and other Unix systems. Application runtimes are self-contained environments that include the necessary libraries, dependencies, and runtime components required for an application to run consistently across different systems. This command provides information about each installed runtime, including its name, architecture, version, and status. It helps in keeping track of the installed runtimes and ensures that the correct runtime is used when running specific applications.'
        arch: '[AI] `flatpak list --arch` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager for Linux systems. It lists all installed Flatpak applications along with their respective architectures. The architecture refers to the specific hardware and software environment the application was built for, such as 32-bit or 64-bit, and any additional dependencies like specific libraries or kernels.'
        columns: '[AI] `flatpak list` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a popular application packaging system for Linux distributions. The `--columns` option modifies the output format of this command to display only specific columns of information. For instance, `flatpak list --columns=Name,Version,InstalledSize` would display the name, version number, and installed size of each installed Flatpak application. This can be useful for quickly checking the details of multiple applications without having to parse through excessive output.'
        help: '[AI] `flatpak list --help` is a command used in the Flatpak packaging system to display information about installed applications and their runtimes. The `--help` option provides detailed usage information for this specific command. It lists the available options, including filters to show specific applications or runtimes based on their names or ids, and formats for outputting the results, such as JSON or tabular format. This command is useful for quickly checking which Flatpak applications are installed on your system, and retrieving more detailed information about them if needed.'
        installation: '[AI] `flatpak list --installation` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to display a list of all installed applications and their corresponding versions. The option `--installation` specifies that you want to see the installed items only, not those available but not yet installed. This command provides useful information for system administrators or users who want an overview of currently installed Flatpak applications with their respective versions.'
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak list --ostree-verbose` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. This specific command lists all installed flatpaks along with their OSTree checksums in a verbose format. OSTree is the underlying versioning system that Flatpak uses to manage and distribute applications. The `--ostree-verbose` option increases the output detail, displaying each installed flatpak''s branch name, commit hash, and other metadata related to its OSTree repository.'
        runtime: '[AI] The `flatpak list --runtime` command is used to list all installed Flatpak runtimes on a system. A Flatpak runtime is a collection of packages that provide a specific environment for running applications. Each runtime includes its own version of the Glibc library, runtime tools, and other dependencies required by the applications it supports. By using this command, you can see the name, architectures supported, and version number of each installed runtime in your system.'
        show-details: '[AI] `flatpak list --show-details` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager to display detailed information about installed applications and their dependencies. When run, it shows a list of all installed apps along with their version number, branch or repo, size, install path, and dependent libraries or runtimes. This command provides more extensive information compared to `flatpak list`, allowing users to better understand the packages they have installed and how they relate to each other.'
        system: '[AI] `flatpak list --system` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system for Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. This specific command lists all installed flatpaks (applications or runtimes) that are globally available system-wide, meaning they can be accessed by any user on the system. The output shows each package''s name, version, and branch, providing an overview of the installed flatpaks at a system level.'
        user: '[AI] `flatpak list --user` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to display a list of installed applications for the current user account. It shows the application ID, name, version, and status (active or inactive) for each installation. This command helps users manage their locally installed applications and check which software is currently available for use.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] `flatpak list --verbose` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager for Linux systems. This command lists all installed Flatpak applications along with detailed information about each one. The '--verbose' flag increases the output detail, providing the following data for each application:

            1. Application ID (unique identifier)
            2. Branch (the repository from which it was installed)
            3. Active (whether it is currently active or not)
            4. Installed Size (the size of the installed package)
            5. Running Size (the size of the running instance)
            6. Version (the version number of the installed application)
            7. Summary (a brief description of the application)
            8. Description (detailed information about the application).
