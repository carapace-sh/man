documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flatpak remote-delete` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to delete a remote repository. This command takes the name or URL of the remote as its argument and removes any local references to it, effectively disconnecting the system from that repository. It does not remove any installed applications or their data unless they were obtained from the deleted remote specifically and have not been subsequently updated from other repositories.'
    flag:
        force: |-
            [AI] The `flatpak remote-delete --force` command is used to forcefully delete a Flatpak remote from your system. Flatpak is a package manager and deployment model for Linux applications. Remotes are repositories or sources where you can find and install the applications.

            With the `--force` option, Flatpak will delete the remote even if it contains installed applications or running services without asking for confirmation. This command is typically used when you want to remove a remote that you no longer need or trust, and you are sure that there are no applications or services that still depend on it.

            Using this command will permanently delete the remote and all its associated data. Therefore, use it with caution and only when you are confident that it is safe to do so.
        help: |-
            [AI] `flatpak remote-delete` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux. This command is used to delete a remote repository from your local Flatpak configuration. The `--help` option provides detailed information about how to use this command. Here's a brief explanation:

            `flatpak remote-delete` [REMOTE]: This is the base command, followed by the name of the remote repository you want to delete.

            `--help`: This option displays comprehensive help information about the `remote-delete` command and its usage. It includes descriptions of all available options, examples, and detailed explanations for each argument.
        installation: '[AI] The `flatpak remote-delete` command is used to remove a Flatpak remote, which is a repository or distribution channel from which you can install applications with Flatpak. The `--installation` flag specifies that you want to delete only the installed applications from the remote, not the remote itself. This means that you will still be able to re-install those applications from the same remote in the future if needed. By deleting just the installed applications, you free up disk space and simplify your application list without losing access to the remote.'
        ostree-verbose: |-
            [AI] `flatpak remote-delete` is a command-line utility used in the Flatpak application packaging system. The `--remote` option specifies which remote repository to operate on, and the `remote-delete` subcommand deletes repositories from your list of known remotes.

            The `--ostree-verbose` option is an additional flag that can be used with `remote-delete`. It makes the command output more detailed information about the repository being deleted, specifically related to the OSTree (an immutable filesystem based on a merge tree) backend used by Flatpaks for versioning and deployment. This verbose mode helps provide more insight into the repository's contents, such as listing the manifests, commits, and their respective hashes being removed during the deletion process.
        system: '[AI] `flatpak remote-delete --system` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system. This command is used to remove a remote repository from the system configuration. The `--system` flag indicates that the operation should be performed on the system-wide Flatpak repositories, which are shared by all users on the system. By deleting a remote, you will no longer be able to install or update packages from that repository.'
        user: '[AI] The `flatpak remote-delete` command is used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. The `--user` option specifies that the operation should be performed on the user''s Flatpak installation instead of the system one. The `remote-delete` subcommand deletes a remote repository from this installation. This means that all applications installed from that specific repository will no longer be available for update or installation.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak remote-delete` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The `--verbose` option makes the command output detailed information as it performs the action. The specific command `flatpak remote-delete --verbose <remote> <repository>` deletes a specified repository from a given remote server in the Flatpak network. The output will include messages indicating which repositories are being deleted, any dependencies being removed, and confirmation once the operation is complete.'
