documentation:
    command: '[AI] `terraform output` is a command used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. This command is utilized to show the output values of specific outputs defined in your Terraform configuration files. These outputs can represent various data such as IP addresses, URLs or other information produced during the infrastructure creation process. The command typically takes the name of the desired output as an argument, e.g., `terraform output output_name`.'
    flag:
        json: '[AI] `terraform output -json` is a command used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. This command generates and outputs the values of Terraform output variables in JSON format. Output variables are defined in Terraform configuration files (usually in the `outputs` block), and they represent the values of infrastructure resources or computations performed during the execution of a Terraform plan or apply. Using this command allows users to easily consume and process the outputs as JSON data, which can be further used by other scripts, tools, or applications.'
        no-color: '[AI] `terraform output -no-color` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Terraform configuration management tool. It retrieves an output value from the last executed Terraform configuration or workflow and displays it in plain text format without any colors. The `-no-color` flag is optional and is used to suppress colorized output for users who prefer plain text or when working with non-graphical interfaces.'
        raw: '[AI] `terraform output -raw` is a command used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. This command returns raw values of specified output variables directly from a Terraform configuration file without formatting or interpolation. The output is printed to the standard output stream and can be used for further processing or assignment to variables in scripts.'
        state: '[AI] `terraform output -state` is a command used with Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. It returns the values of outputs defined in a Terraform configuration file. The `-state` argument specifies that the state file should be used to get the latest data for the outputs. This command helps to retrieve and view the output values without having to run the entire Terraform application.'
