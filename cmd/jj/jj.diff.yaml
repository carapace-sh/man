    command: |-
        [AI] The `jj` command is not a standard Unix or Linux command. It appears to be specific to the Vim text editor's built-in diff mode for comparing and merging files.

        When you run `:diff JJ` in Vim (where `JJ` can be any number), it opens a new window displaying the differences between the current file and another file (specified by its filename or buffer number). The changes are highlighted, and you can navigate through them using various commands.

        The `jj` part of the command is used to move between hunks (blocks) of changes in the diff window. Pressing `jj` will take you to the next hunk below the current one. This allows you to easily traverse through the differences in your files.

        color-words: |-
            [AI] `jj` is not a flag but a command-line tool for interactive Git usage. The given command is actually a combination of `git` and `diff` commands with the option `--color-words`.

            `git diff` compares the differences between commits or working directories, while `--color-words` adds syntax highlighting to make it easier to identify the context of changes, such as code changes (e.g., added, modified, deleted lines).

            So, in summary, the command `jj diff --color-words` can be broken down into:

            1. Run Git diff command
            2. Use the `--color-words` option to enable syntax highlighting for better visibility of changes.
        from: '[AI] `jj diff --from` is a command used in the Jira Issue Navigator search interface to display the differences between two versions of a commit message or a text field in a Jira issue. The `--from` option specifies the revision or label of the previous version for comparison purposes. This command helps developers and other users to easily identify changes made between different revisions, facilitating effective collaboration and communication within a software development project using Jira.'
        git: '[AI] The command `jj diff --git` is used in version control systems, specifically with Git, to display the differences between two file versions or directory branches in a git repository. The `--git` option instructs JDiff, which is a pager for Git''s diff output, to format the output as Git would by default. This allows users to see the differences in an easily understandable and Git-compatible way. The primary purpose of this command is to help review changes between different revisions or branches, making it useful for code reviews, merging changes, and understanding the history of a project.'
        help: '[AI] `jj` is a popular Git alias or extension for interactive staging and easy committing in Git. The command `jj diff --help` displays the help message for the `diff` sub-command of `jj`. It describes how to use this command to view the differences between your current changes and the last commit, local file changes, or a staged file. It also explains options such as showing the differences in a patch format, using pager for large outputs, or merging differences when using three-way merge tools.'
        revision: '[AI] `jj` is a popular Git extension for Vim that provides various useful features for working with Git repositories within Vim. The command `jj diff --revision <commit>` is used to open a diff view of the changes made in a specific Git commit, where `<commit>` is the hash or branch name of the desired commit. This allows you to compare and review the differences between your working directory and the selected commit, which can be helpful for merging changes, understanding what was modified, or resolving conflicts.'
        stat: '[AI] `jj diff --stat` is a command used in Git or other version control systems to display a summary of changes between two commit versions, in a human-readable statistic format. The "--stat" option generates a detailed statistics output for each file showing additions (+), deletions (-), and modifications (M) made in each file during the commit. This command is often used for quick comparison of differences between commits and to understand what changes were made.'
        summary: |-
            [AI] `jj` is not a known flag for `diff`. The correct command to display a summary of changes between two files using `git diff` or `diff` utilities would be:

            * `git diff --summary <file1> <file2>` (for version control system `git`)
            * `diff --summary <file1> <file2>` (for standard Unix `diff` utility)

            These commands display a brief summary of changes between the two specified files, including the number of added and deleted lines.
        to: |-
            [AI] `jj` is not a standard flag for `diff`, which is a command-line utility for comparing and showing the differences between files or directories. The correct syntax for `diff` to display differences from one file to another is:

            ```bash
            diff FILE1 FILE2
            ```

            If you want to compare the differences of a file with its previous version in the same directory using Git, you can use the following command instead:

            ```bash
            git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- FILE_NAME
            ```

            However, if by "jj diff --to" you meant using `jj` as a Git extension for handling interactive rebase, then the correct usage would be:

            ```bash
            jj rebase --interactive <commit-hash>
            ```

            And during an interactive rebase session, use the command 'd' or 's' to edit specific files and then 'p' to stage the changes, effectively staging the differences between two commits. This is not a direct usage of `diff`, but rather using Git functionality with `jj`.
        tool: '[AI] The `jj` command is a user-friendly Git interface for interactive rebasing and conflict resolution. The `diff --tool` flag that follows it is used to invoke an external tool for merging or comparing differences between branches or commits in an interactive and graphical way. Instead of using the default three-way merge strategy, the tool allows users to visually inspect and manually modify changes before they are committed. This can be particularly helpful when dealing with complex conflicts or merges.'
        types: |-
            [AI] The `jj diff --types` command is a part of JDiff, a text-based diff and merge tool for JSON data. This specific command is used to display only the types of changes between two JSON documents.

            The output includes lines that begin with either '+' (for added), '-' (for deleted), or 'C' (for changed), followed by the type of JSON data that was modified. Types can include numbers, strings, booleans, null, arrays, and objects. This allows for a quick overview of the changes in a JSON document at a high level without having to dive into the specific values.
