    command: '[AI] The "waypoint user" command in OpenStreetMap editing tools like JOSM or Potlatch is used to create, modify, or delete waypoints on the map. A waypoint is a type of point feature that represents a specific location with no associated direction or length. Users can add descriptions, tags, and icons to waypoints for added information. This command allows users to interact directly with waypoints, making it essential for editing data related to tourism, landmarks, or other location-specific information.'
