documentation:
    command: '[AI] "charms completion" is not a standard Unix or Linux command. It seems to be specific to some text editors or configuration management tools, such as Charms in Ansible or Microsoft PowerShell. In these contexts, it refers to auto-completion features that suggest possible completions based on the text already typed. These tools learn from patterns and provide suggestions for next characters to type, helping users to write code more efficiently and accurately.'
