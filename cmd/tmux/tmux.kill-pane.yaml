documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux kill-pane` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to terminate the current pane in the active window. When executed, it sends the SIGKILL signal (default) or SIGTERM signal (with the `-t` option and a pane ID) to the process group of the targeted pane. This results in terminating the running process and the associated pane, freeing up resources.'
    flag:
        a: '[AI] The `tmux kill-pane` command with the `-a` option is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to kill all panes (sub-windows) in the current session. This can be useful when you want to terminate all running processes or tasks within the session and close it completely. The `-a` flag signifies that all panes should be killed, not just the currently active one.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux kill-pane` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to delete an active pane (split window) within a TMUX session. The `-t` option specifies the target pane ID or name, allowing you to selectively terminate that specific pane. By using this command, you can remove unwanted panes from your TMUX layout.'
