    command: '[AI] The `rustup set default-host` command is used in Rust programming language to configure Rustup, Rust''s package manager, to use a specific Rust host triple as the default for installing new crates and components. A Rust host triple specifies the combination of Rust version, OS, and architecture. For example, "1.21.0 x86_64-pc-windows-msvc" is a valid Rust host triple. By setting a default host, Rustup will use that configuration whenever you install new packages unless you explicitly specify a different one.'
    flag:
        help: |-
            [AI] `rustup set default-host` is a Rust upgrade tool (Rustup) command used to configure the default Rust host for your system. The `--help` flag provides information on how to use this specific command with options:

            ```
            rustup set default-host <flag>...

            Set the default Rust host. This affects which Rust installations are activated and which one is used by default when invoking `rustc`, `rust-gcc`, `cargo`, etc.

            Usage: rustup set default-host <target>

            Flags:
            --help             Print out help information (what you're reading right now)
            --verbose          Show more information about what's happening
            ```

            To use the command, specify a target Rust host as an argument, such as `rustup set default-host stable`, or `rustup set default-host nightly`. This will make the specified Rust host the default one for your system.
        version: '[AI] `rustup set default-host --version` is a Rust programming language command used to configure `rustup`, Rust''s package manager, to use a specific version of the Rust compiler (Rustc) as the default for your projects. The `--version` option allows you to specify the desired Rustc version. This command helps ensure consistency and simplify build configurations across multiple Rust projects.'
