        [AI] "Dagger completion PowerShell" refers to integrating Dagger, a popular Kubernetes application definition tool, with PowerShell for autocompleting Kubernetes resource fields and YAML syntax while writing or editing PowerShell scripts. To use it, you need to have both Dagger and the PowerShell module `DaggerPS` installed. After installation, enable the Dagger completion in PowerShell using the following command:

        ```powershell
        Install-Module -Name DaggerPS -Scope CurrentUser -Force; Import-Module DaggerPS
        ```

        Once the module is imported, you can take advantage of Dagger's intelligent autocompletion feature by starting your PowerShell prompt with `kube:`. For instance:

        ```powershell
        kube: new-app mynamespace/myimage:latest -- port 80 --name myapp
        ```

        As you type, the PowerShell prompt will provide suggestions based on Dagger's knowledge of Kubernetes resources and YAML syntax. This can help save time and reduce errors when managing your Kubernetes applications using PowerShell.
    flag:
        no-descriptions: '[AI] The command `dagger completion powershell --no-descriptions` is used to install PowerShell completions for Dagger, a Kubernetes application packaging and deployment tool, without including description information in the completions. This means that the autocomplete suggestions provided in your PowerShell terminal will only include valid options, but won''t provide additional descriptive text.'
