        configuration: '[AI] `ng run` is a command used in Angular projects to execute various tasks, such as building, testing, or serving the application. The `--configuration` option allows you to specify which configuration file to use for that task. By default, Angular uses the main `angular.json` configuration file. However, you can have multiple configuration files for different environments or scenarios (e.g., `production.json`, `development.json`), and using `--configuration` allows you to choose which one to apply when running tasks with `ng run`.'
