    command: '[AI] "Dart" is a programming language developed by Google, known for its fast development cycle and modern features. The `dart` command in a terminal or command prompt is used to invoke the Dart application, which compiles and runs Dart code written with the .dart file extension. It can be used to build standalone applications, libraries, or even run web projects using Dart''s server-side framework, called AngularDart.'
    flag:
        disable-analytics: '[AI] The `--disable-analytics` flag in Dart is used to disable the collection and reporting of usage statistics to Google. This is accomplished by preventing Dart from making connections to Google''s servers during runtime. By using this flag, developers can run their applications without sending any analytics data.'
        enable-analytics: '[AI] `dart --enable-analytics` is a command-line argument for Dart, the programming language. This option enables Dart''s analytics feature, which gathers statistical data about how your Dart code is being used at runtime. The collected data can be sent to Google for analysis using the associated service called "Firebase Crashlytics" or "Flutter Analyze". This information can then be used for improving application performance and identifying issues in production environments.'
        help: '[AI] `dart --help` is a command used in Dart programming language to display help information about the Dart command-line tool. It provides an overview of various subcommands and their usage, along with detailed descriptions and examples where applicable. Using this command can assist users in understanding how to use Dart for tasks such as running a Dart script, starting a Dart application server, or analyzing Dart code for errors and suggestions.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `dart --verbose` command is used to run a Dart program with enhanced output. When you execute this command, Dart''s standard output (often referred to as ''stderr'') will display detailed information about the runtime and the Dart VM, including messages related to compilation, loading of libraries, and garbage collection. This can be helpful for debugging and understanding what is happening behind the scenes when running a Dart application.'
        version: '[AI] `dart --version` is a command-line instruction for the Dart programming language. It''s used to check and display the installed version of the Dart executable, along with any associated tools like the Dart analysis tool or the pub get package manager. This command provides developers with important information for their project setup and helps ensure they are using the correct version of Dart for their work.'
