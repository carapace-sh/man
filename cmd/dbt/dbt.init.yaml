documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dbt init` is a command used in dbt (Data Build Tool), an open-source data transformation and testing toolkit. It sets up a new dbt project by creating the necessary directory structure, including a `profiles.yml` file, and installing required dependencies within your project''s virtual environment. Once executed, you will have a fully functional dbt project ready for writing transformations (SQL files) and tests.'
    flag:
        profile: '[AI] `dbt init --profile` is a command used in dbt (data build tool), an open-source data transformation and orchestration toolkit. This command initializes a new dbt project with a specified profile. Profiles are configurations that allow users to set up different database connections, environments, or other settings for their dbt projects. By providing the `--profile` option followed by the name of an existing profile file, this command sets up the new project to use that specific configuration from the start.'
        project-dir: '[AI] `dbt init --project-dir` is a command used in dbt (data build tool), an open-source data transformation and orchestration tool. This command initializes a new dbt project in the specified directory (--project-dir) by creating essential files and directories, such as `profiles.yml`, `dbt_projects.yml`, and a `models` folder for data models. The project will be configured to use dbt''s CLI to execute data transformations and manage metadata.'
        skip-profile-setup: '[AI] `dbt init --skip-profile-setup` is a command used in dbt (Data Build Tool), an open-source data transformation and orchestration tool. This command initializes a new dbt project, but skips the setup of profiles. Profiles define how data is connected to various sources and targets in the project. By using `--skip-profile-setup`, you create an empty dbt project without any initial configuration for data connections. You can set up your profiles later according to your specific requirements.'
        target: '[AI] `dbt init --target` is a command used in dbt (data build tool), an open-source data transformation and testing toolkit. This command creates a new dbt project with the specified target database or cloud platform (such as Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, etc.) as the destination for your data models. It sets up the necessary file structure, including the `profiles.yml` file to configure connection settings to your target database or cloud platform. Once initialized, you can start writing SQL models using dbt syntax to build and manage your data pipelines.'
        vars: '[AI] `dbt init --vars` is a command used in dbt (data build tool), an open-source data transformation and orchestration tool. This command initializes a new dbt project, applying given YAML variables during the process. These variables can be used to set up configuration values for your dbt project directly from the command line. The `--vars` flag is where you provide these variables in key-value format. For instance, `dbt init --vars=''my_var: value''`. This way, you can customize your project settings during initialization without modifying the project files manually.'
