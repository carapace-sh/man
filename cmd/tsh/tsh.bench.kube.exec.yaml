flags:
    --container=: Selects the container to exec into.
    --interactive: Create interactive Kube session
    --no-interactive&: Create interactive Kube session
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tsh bench kube exec` is a command used in the Turbonomic performance testing tool (TSH). It executes benchmark tests against Kubernetes clusters using the `kubeexec` plugin. This command measures and reports on various performance metrics, such as CPU and memory usage, I/O throughput, and network latency, for specified workloads running within the Kubernetes environment. The results help assess the performance and identify potential bottlenecks in the cluster.'
    flag:
        container: '[AI] The `tsh bench kube exec --container` command is used in the Kubernetes ecosystem with the Tsh (Tilt Shift) tool. This command executes a container directly from a Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl exec` sub-command. "Bench" here refers to running performance tests or evaluations on the contained process within the specified container. In summary, this command executes a specific container and performs benchmarking tests against it within the Kubernetes environment.'
        interactive: '[AI] `tsh bench kube exec --interactive` is a command used in Tesh (Test Shaw) for Kubernetes testing. This command runs an interactive Kubernetes container execution using the `kubectl exec` command, which is part of the Kubernetes toolset. The `--interactive` flag enables an interactive session with the container''s standard input, output, and error streams, allowing users to interactively test applications within the container environment. The benchmarking aspect of the command (`tsh bench`) measures the performance of this interaction between Tesh and the Kubernetes cluster.'
        no-interactive: |-
            [AI] The `tsh bench kube exec --no-interactive` command is a usage of the Tilt Shift Helm (TSH) tool, specifically the `bench` subcommand for performance testing and the `kube exec` command for executing commands in Kubernetes containers.

            The `--no-interactive` flag indicates that no interactive sessions or terminals should be started when running the command inside the container. This is useful when automating tests or scripts, as it avoids any potential user interaction and ensures consistent results.
