documentation:
    command: '[AI] The term "tea pulls" is not a standard command or a recognized concept in any specific field, such as computing or programming. It may be a colloquial or idiosyncratic expression with no clear meaning without additional context. Without more information, it''s impossible to provide an explanation for this term.'
    flag:
        comments: '[AI] The `--comments --teapulls` flag is a command-line option used in Git repositories, specifically with tools like Hub or Fork to automatically pull and merge comments from a remote repository into a local one. When you use this flag, the tool will fetch any new comments made on pull requests or merged branches, and apply them to your local copies of those commits. This helps keep your local repository in sync with the latest developments in a collaborative project.'
        fields: '[AI] `teapull --fields` is a command used in Apache NiFi, a data integration system. It''s part of the FlowFile processor called "TeaExecutor" that allows users to invoke external scripts or programs as part of their data flows. The `--fields` option specifies which fields from the incoming FlowFile data should be passed as arguments to the invoked script or program. This helps in processing and transforming specific data elements within the data flow.'
        limit: '[AI] The `--limit` flag in a `teapull` command is used to specify the maximum number of revisions or objects to be fetched from a remote Git repository during a pull operation. It helps prevent unintended fetching of unnecessary data, reducing network usage and potential conflicts in local changes. By default, Git fetches all historical data available from the remote repository, but with `--limit`, you can set a limit on the number of revisions or objects to be pulled. This is particularly useful when dealing with large or slow repositories, where fetching only the required data can save time and resources.'
        login: '[AI] `tea pulls --login` is a command used in the TEA (Temporal Effects Assistant) tool, which is a DevOps tool for managing Kubernetes applications. This specific command is used to pull an image from a container registry and log into it with credentials stored in a Kubernetes secret or configuration file. The `--login` flag indicates that the command should also attempt to authenticate with the registry using the provided credentials before pulling the image, ensuring that the correct image is retrieved and reducing the risk of image theft or manipulation.'
        output: '[AI] `teapulls --output` is a command used in Kubernetes to describe and export the YAML definition of custom resources or controllers defined using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that have been deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. The `--output` flag specifies the format for the output, which can be set to json, yaml, or go-template. For example, `teapulls --output yaml mycustomresource.crd.yaml` exports the definition of a custom resource named "mycustomresource" in YAML format.'
        page: '[AI] The `--page` flag is used with Git''s `log` command (`git log --page`) to display the commit messages and their associated patch sets in a paged format, making it easier to read long commit histories in the terminal. It automatically sets the `LESS` or `PAGER` environment variable to the `less` pager utility for better navigation through the output.'
        remote: '[AI] The `--remote tea pulls` command in Git is used to fetch and update branches or repositories from a remote repository, specifically named ''tea''. This operation does not create any local branches or make any changes to the current working directory, it only updates the local repository with the latest changes from the specified remote.'
        repo: '[AI] The command `tea pulls --repo` is used in the TeaVM toolkit for Java Virtual Machines (JVMs). It signifies pulling a new repository or updating an existing one with the latest changes from a remote Git server. This action helps keep your local TeaVM project up-to-date with the latest developments, bug fixes, and improvements in the main repository.'
        state: |-
            [AI] `teapulls --state` is a command used in Kubernetes to interact with PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs). The `--state` flag filters the output based on the given state:

            1. `all`: Shows all PVs and PVCs, regardless of their state.
            2. `available`: Shows only available PVs. An available PV is one that can be bound by a PersistentVolumeClaim.
            3. `bound`: Shows only PVCs that are currently bound to a specific PV.
            4. `reclaimed`: Shows only PVs that have been reclaimed by the Kubernetes cluster after their associated PVC was deleted.

            Using this command with the `--state` flag helps manage PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims efficiently in a Kubernetes environment.
