name: run-graph
description: Generate a graph of the execution order
flags:
    -l, --label=: Label used in graph nodes (it could be either "stack.name" or "stack.dir"
    -o, --outfile=: Output .dot file
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `terramate experimental run-graph` command is used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, to generate a graph representation of the dependencies between resources in an experimental configuration. This command reads the configuration files and executes the input actions as if they were an actual apply, but it doesn''t make any changes to your real infrastructure. Instead, it outputs a graph description that shows how resources are interconnected based on their dependencies. This information can be useful for understanding complex configurations and optimizing your deployment strategy.'
    flag:
        label: '[AI] The `--label` option in the `terramate experimental run-graph` command is used to assign a descriptive label to the graph that will be generated by Terramate, an open-source engineering systems modeling and analysis tool. This label helps distinguish different graphs when multiple graphs are being generated, making it easier for users to identify and manage them in their workflows or data visualization tools.'
        outfile: '[AI] The `terraform init experiment run --outfile` command in Terraform is used to execute an experiment, which is a set of actions that modify Terraform''s behavior for testing and development purposes. The `--outfile` option specifies the output file where the results of the experiment will be saved as JSON format. This allows users to store and analyze the output of their experiments. The `terraform init` part of the command initializes or updates the Terraform working directory, including downloading required provider plugins.'
