It seems to be specific to the Tempora Supervisor (TSH) tool, which is used for managing and monitoring Apache Traffic Server (ATS) instances. This command might be an alias or shorthand for performing certain actions related to ATS zones in TSH. For more detailed information about this command, please refer to the Tempora Supervisor documentation.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] `tsh` is a command-line tool for Traefik, a reverse proxy and load balancer. The `--app` flag is used with `tsh` to manage and interact with individual applications defined in the Traefik configuration. It takes the name of an application as an argument, allowing you to perform various tasks such as starting, stopping, or checking the status of that particular application. For instance, `tsh --app my-app` followed by a command like `start` would start the "my-app" in the Traefik configuration.'
