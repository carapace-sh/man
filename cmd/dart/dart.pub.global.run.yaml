    command: '[AI] `dart pub global run` is a command used in Dart programming language for running globally installed packages as standalone applications without requiring a specific project setup. It searches for and executes the main script of the global package, making it convenient to use tools and utilities installed with `pub global activate`.'
    flag:
        enable-asserts: |-
            [AI] The `dart pub global run --enable-asserts` command is used in Dart programming language to run a Dart package globally with assertions enabled.

            `pub` is a package manager for Dart, and `global` installs packages globally across your system instead of just the current project. The `run` part executes the installed package as a script.

            The `--enable-asserts` flag enables the use of assertions in the code. Assertions are conditions that, if not met during runtime, will cause an error and halt the program's execution. They help developers detect issues early during development but are typically disabled for production use due to their performance impact and potential to hide real errors by masking unmet assertions.

            So, `dart pub global run --enable-asserts` installs a package globally and runs it with assertions enabled, which is useful for testing and debugging the package during development.
        enable-experiment: |-
            [AI] `dart pub global run --enable-experiment` is a command used in Dart programming language for running Dart applications or packages globally with experimental features enabled. The `dart` part refers to the Dart executable, `pub` is the package manager for Dart, and `global` is used to install and manage global packages.

            The `run` command instructs Dart to execute a specific script or application. The `--enable-experiment` flag enables experimental features in the Dart runtime that are not part of the stable release. This could be useful when working with new language features, or when using packages that rely on such features.

            This command assumes that the project's configuration file, usually called `pubspec.yaml`, is located at the current directory and specifies the main application entry point. Once executed, this command installs any required dependencies as global packages, enables experimental features, and runs the application or script.
        help: '[AI] `dart pub global run --help` is a command used in Dart programming language for managing and running packages globally using the Dart Pub tool. The `--help` option displays detailed help information about this specific command. In simpler terms, it shows you how to use `dart pub global run` effectively to execute a global Dart application with dependencies from the pubspec.yaml file.'
        no-enable-asserts: |-
            [AI] The `dart pub global run --no-enable-asserts` command is used to run a Dart package as a globally installed application with no assertions enabled. Here's a brief explanation of each part:

            * `dart`: This refers to the Dart programming language's executable.
            * `pub`: Dart Pub is the package manager for the Dart ecosystem. It manages dependencies and provides tools for building and running applications.
            * `global`: This flag tells Dart Pub to install the specified package globally, meaning it will be available to use from any directory in the system.
            * `run`: This command runs the main script of the installed package as an application.
            * `--no-enable-asserts`: This flag disables the running of assertions. Assertions are used during development to check conditions that should hold true, but they can add unnecessary overhead and checks in a production environment, so it's common to disable them when deploying applications.
        no-sound-null-safety: |-
            [AI] The command `dart pub global run --no-sound-null-safety` is used to run a Dart package as a globally installed executable, bypassing the null safety feature introduced in Dart 2.0.

            Here's a breakdown of the command:

            * `dart`: Invokes the Dart executable.
            * `pub`: Refers to the Dart package manager called Pub.
            * `global`: Indicates that the command will be run globally, i.e., using a command-line interface, and not within an individual project.
            * `run`: Instructs the system to execute the specified package as a standalone application.
            * `--no-sound-null-safety`: Disables the null safety feature during runtime. This flag should be used only when necessary since null safety is generally beneficial for preventing errors in Dart code.
        sound-null-safety: |-
            [AI] The command `dart pub global run --sound-null-safety` is used in Dart programming language for running a globally installed package with Dart's built-in null safety feature called "Sound Null Safety."

            This command does the following:

            1. `dart`: It specifies that the Dart runtime environment should be used to execute the command.
            2. `pub`: It calls the Dart Package Manager (Pub) which is used for downloading, installing, and managing packages.
            3. `global`: It runs the specified command globally, which means it uses the installed package from the global (site-wide) installation instead of a local one.
            4. `run`: It executes the main script or entry point of the package.
            5. `--sound-null-safety`: It enables Dart's Sound Null Safety feature, which is designed to prevent null reference errors at compile time by ensuring that every value is either known to be non-nullable or has a null check in place. This makes your code more robust and less error-prone.
