    command: |-
        [AI] `git submodule set-url` is a Git command used to update the URL of an existing submodule in your Git repository. When you clone a repository that contains submodules, those submodules might be configured to fetch from an external URL. You can use `git submodule set-url` to change that URL to point to a different location. The syntax is as follows:

        ```bash
        git submodule set-url [<subdirectory>] [<new_url>]
        ```

        Replace `[subdirectory]` with the name of the subdirectory (i.e., the submodule) and `[new_url]` with the new URL you want to use. By default, it will only update the local repository; if you want to push this change to a remote repository, you'll need to do so separately using commands like `git push`.
