documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nix run` command is used to execute a specific task or build a project managed by Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It fetches the required build inputs from the Nix expression or channel, sets up the environment, and runs the specified command or build process. This allows for reproducible builds and consistent execution across different systems.'
    flag:
        arg: |-
            [AI] `nx run` is a command used in the Nx project builder for Angular applications. The `--arg` option is used to pass an argument to a specific Nx task or application. For instance, if you have an Angular application named "my-app" and there's a build task named "build", you can run this task with a custom argument using the following command:

            ```bash
            nx run my-app:build -- arg:myCustomArgument
            ```

            In this example, `--arg` is used to pass an additional argument called "myCustomArgument" to the build task. This argument can be used in the task configuration file or in your application code as an environment variable or a configuration option.
        argstr: |-
            [AI] `nix run` is a command in Nix packaging system used to build and run projects. The `--argstr` option is passed to specify arguments for a project's script or binary. When using this option, the argument string should be provided in the format "name=value". Multiple arguments can be separated by commas. For example:

            ```bash
            nix run myproject -- arg1=value1 arg2=value2
            ```

            The command above will run `myproject` with the given arguments, which are passed to its entrypoint as positional arguments (`$1`, `$2`, ...).
        commit-lock-file: '[AI] The `nix run --commit-lock-file` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command runs a specific Nix expression, creating or updating a commit-lock file. The commit-lock file ensures that all build inputs have hashed versions, which can''t be changed without updating the lock file. This helps maintain reproducible builds and stable dependencies across different environments.'
        debug: '[AI] `nix-run --debug` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `--debug` flag enables debug mode during the execution of a Nix expression or function. This means that Nix will print more detailed output and diagnostic information to help identify any issues that may occur during the build or evaluation process. It can be useful for troubleshooting complex installations, customizing builds, or understanding how a specific Nix command works under the hood.'
        debugger: '[AI] `nix-run --debugger` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command launches the specified Nix expression or built-in function with a debugger attached, allowing developers to inspect and modify the runtime environment at breakpoints, stepping through code, and examining variables. It''s an essential tool for advanced users and developers seeking greater control over their software stack in a reproducible, containerized environment.'
        eval-store: '[AI] `nix run --eval-store` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It evaluates and stores expressions in the Nix expression language in the local Nix expression cache or store. The result of the evaluation is then used to build or configure software packages within the Nix ecosystem. This command can be useful when you want to define custom components, modify existing configurations, or experiment with new Nix expressions without affecting your current configuration or packages.'
        impure: '[AI] The `--impure` flag in Nix is used when invoking a Nix expression or command that has side effects and may modify the file system or environment outside of its sandboxed build environment. By setting this flag, Nix will not enforce its default strict isolation mode and instead allow the command to interact with the surrounding system. This can be useful in certain situations where integration with existing infrastructure is necessary, but it comes with increased risk of unintended side effects or security vulnerabilities.'
        include: '[AI] `nx run` is a command used in Nx, a DevOps platform built by Angular, for running applications or tasks defined in an Nx project. The `--include` flag is an option that allows you to specify multiple projects or targets to include in the build or execution process. For example, `nx run myProject:build --include @project:subProject:build` will build both "myProject" and "subProject".'
        inputs-from: '[AI] The `nix run` command is a part of Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. The `--inputs-from` option specifies a Nix expression that defines the inputs (dependencies) for the command that follows. For example, `nix run myproject --inputs-from myproject.nix` runs the command inside `myproject.nix` with the specified dependencies provided by that expression. This allows you to build and run projects with consistent environments and dependencies.'
        log-format: '[AI] `nix run` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. It''s used to build and run applications packaged with Nix. The `--log-format` option specifies the format of the output logged during the build or run process. Commonly used formats include "plain", "json" or "progress". For example, `nix run --log-format json myapp.nix` will produce logs in JSON format.'
        no-registries: '[AI] The `nix run --no-registries` command is used in Nix packaging system to build and run a project without using any external package registries. In other words, it specifies that all the required packages should be built from sources available locally or in the Nix distribution itself. This can be useful for environments where access to external registries is restricted or not desired.'
        no-update-lock-file: '[AI] `nix run` is a command used in Nix packaging system to build and run a project. The `--no-update-lock-file` option disables the creation of a lock file when running the project. A lock file is used by Nix to ensure that specific versions of dependencies are used during the build and run process, preventing version conflicts. By using `--no-update-lock-file`, you allow the system to use the latest available versions of dependencies instead. This can be useful for testing or development scenarios where you want to use the most recent packages without having to update the lock file manually.'
        no-write-lock-file: '[AI] The `--no-write-lock-file` flag is an option used with Nix package manager''s `run` command. This option disables the creation of a write lock file when running a command or building a package. A write lock file is used to prevent other processes from modifying a package at the same time, ensuring data consistency. By using `--no-write-lock-file`, Nix skips this safety measure and allows multiple processes to modify the same package concurrently. This can lead to conflicts or inconsistencies if not handled carefully.'
        override-flake: |-
            [AI] The `nix run --override-flake` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems, to build and run a specific project from a Nix expression or Flake (Nix's new experimental build and configuration system).

            The `--override-flake` flag allows running a project even if its Flake configuration file has changed since the last build. This is useful when developing and testing, as it avoids rebuilding all dependencies from scratch every time a single change is made to the project configuration. Instead, only the affected project is rebuilt.
        override-input: '[AI] `nx run --override-input` is a command used in the Nx framework for Angular projects. It allows running a specific Nx task while providing custom input values to override the default ones. The `--override-input` flag is followed by a key-value pair specifying the name of the input and its new value. For example, `nx run my-project:build --override-inputs:myInput=myValue`. This command will build the project while using `myValue` instead of the default value for the `myInput` input.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] `nix run` is a command from Nix Package Manager used to build and run a specific project or application. The `--print-build-logs` option is used to display the output of the build process, including any error messages or other important logs, in real-time as the build is running. This can be helpful for debugging issues with the build or understanding what''s happening during the build process.'
        quiet: '[AI] `nix-run` is a command in Nix packaging system used to execute a Nix expression or a compiled binary. The `--quiet` flag reduces the output of `nix-run` to only display errors and warnings during execution, making the console output more succinct.'
        recreate-lock-file: '[AI] `nix run` is a command provided by Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. The `--recreate-lock-file` option is used to force Nix to create or update the lock file when running a build or a command with `nix run`. A lock file ensures that multiple instances of a build do not interfere with each other, thus providing deterministic builds and avoiding conflicts. By using this option, Nix will create or update the lock file before executing the requested command.'
        update-input: '[AI] The `nx run --update-input` command is part of Nx, a set of DevTools for Angular and other projects. This specific command is used to update input files or assets for an existing Nx project before running tasks such as building or testing. It checks if any input files have been modified since the last build, and if so, updates the internal metadata to ensure that the task uses the latest versions of those files. This helps to ensure that the build process uses the most up-to-date code changes.'
        verbose: '[AI] `nix run --verbose` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command runs a Nix expression with increased output, displaying more detailed information about the build and execution process. The verbose option allows users to debug issues or gain insight into the inner workings of their Nix configurations.'
