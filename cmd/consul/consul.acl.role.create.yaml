documentation:
    command: '[AI] `consul acl role create` is a Command Line Interface (CLI) command used with Consul, a connectivity and configuration management tool. This command creates a new Access Control List (ACL) role in the Consul data center or cluster. Roles define sets of permissions that can be assigned to Consul agents or services for secure access to different resources within the Consul ecosystem. By using `consul acl role create`, you can specify various parameters like name, policies (permissions), and tags to define the new ACL role. The command returns a unique ID upon successful creation of the role.'
    flag:
        description: '[AI] The `consul acl role create` command in Hashicorp Consul is used to create a new Access Control List (ACL) role. The `--description` option allows you to provide a brief description or label for the new role, helping to make it clear what permissions and access this role grants. This information is solely for documentation purposes and does not affect the actual permissions of the role.'
        format: '[AI] The `consul acl role create --format` command is used with the Consul Access Control List (ACL) tool to create a new ACL role definition. The `--format` option specifies the output format for the command, which can be in either HCL (Hashtable Configuration Language) or JSON formats. This allows users to easily save and manage their ACL definitions as code. When you run this command, Consul creates a new role based on the provided definition, but without applying it to any policies or tokens yet. The created role definition is then output in the specified format for further use.'
        meta: '[AI] `consul acl role create --meta` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This specific command creates a new Access Control List (ACL) role within Consul with custom metadata attached to it. The metadata can include key-value pairs that provide additional information about the role. Once created, this role can be assigned to policies, which in turn control access to resources within the Consul environment.'
        name: '[AI] The `consul acl role create` command is used in Hashicorp Consul to create a new Access Control List (ACL) role within Consul''s access control system. This command takes an argument `--name`, which specifies the desired name for the new ACL role. Once created, this role can be assigned permissions to resources within a Consul data-center, allowing for fine-grained access control in a distributed and secure manner.'
        namespace: '[AI] The `consul acl role create --namespace` command in Consul is used to create a new Access Control List (ACL) role definition within a specific Kubernetes namespace. This command is part of the Consul ACL plugin for managing access to resources in a Kubernetes cluster using Consul''s ACL system. The role definition can be assigned permissions to access various resources, such as namespaces, pods, or services, within the specified namespace.'
        node-identity: '[AI] The `consul acl role create --node-identity` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command creates a new Access Control List (ACL) role with the specified node identity. A node identity is a unique identifier assigned to each Consul agent or client. The created role allows defining permissions for that specific identity in the Consul datacenter, such as read, write, or manage access to various resources.'
        policy-id: '[AI] The `consul acl role create` command is used to create a new Access Control List (ACL) role in Consul, which is a data center and service mesh solution from Hashicorp. The `--policy-id` flag specifies the ID of an existing ACL policy that defines the access permissions for this new role. When you create a role using this command, it automatically assigns the specified policy to the role by default, but you can also modify or remove the assigned policies later using other Consul API calls. This flag helps in granting specific access rights to the newly created ACL role based on the existing policies in your Consul environment.'
        policy-name: '[AI] The `consul acl role create --policy-name` command is used in Hashicorp Consul to create a new Access Control List (ACL) role with the specified policy name. The policy defines the permissions granted to an ACL token or user within the Consul service, such as read or write access to specific keys or namespaces. This command allows you to manage and configure who has access to what resources in your Consul environment.'
        service-identity: '[AI] The `consul acl role create --service-identity` command in Consul is used to create an Access Control List (ACL) role with the specific permission to manage service identities. Service identities are entities that represent applications or services in the Consul system, and this command allows an administrator to grant certain users or groups the ability to create, modify, and delete these identities through ACL policies. By defining and enforcing roles and policies, Consul helps ensure secure access to its services and functionality within an organization.'
