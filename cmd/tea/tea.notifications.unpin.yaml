documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea notifications unpin` command is used in the Terminal-based chat application called `tea` to unpin a specific notification. Once unpinned, the notification will no longer appear at the top of the notification list and will be moved back to its original position based on the time it was received.'
    flag:
        limit: '[AI] The `tea notifications unpin --limit` command in the Tea (Terminal Emulation Admin) tool is used to unpin a specific number of notifications from the top of the notification list. The `--limit` option specifies how many notifications should be unpinned at once. For example, `tea notifications unpin --limit 3` would unpin the three most recent notifications from the list.'
        login: '[AI] `tea notifications unpin --login` is a command used in the Terminal, specifically for the Tea interface (a CLI tool for interacting with GitHub) to unpin a notification on GitHub associated with a specific repository or issue. The `--login` flag indicates that the user is authenticated and logged into their GitHub account before running this command.'
        mine: '[AI] The command `tea notifications unpin --mine` is used in the Tea (Terminal Every Anything) application for managing terminal notifications on Linux systems. This command unpins or removes the notifications that are marked as "mine" or owned by the current user from the notification list. Unpinning notifications allows them to reappear at the top of the notification list when they are received again, making it easier to keep track of important notifications.'
        output: '[AI] The command `tea notifications unpin --output` is related to the Tea interface for interacting with GitHub notifications. This specific command unpins a notification, meaning it removes it from the top of your notification list so that new notifications will take its place. The `--output` option specifies that the output of the command should be printed to the console. In summary, this command unpins a GitHub notification and displays no further interaction prompt or file output.'
        page: '[AI] The `tea notifications unpin --page` command is used in the Tea (Terminal Emulator Application) tool, which is a popular terminal emulator for macOS and Linux. This command is used to unpin a specific notification page in Tea''s notification center. Notifications are grouped into pages by default when there are too many to fit on the screen at once. By running `unpin --page`, you can remove that page from the notification center, bringing all notifications on that page back to the top so they can be viewed and cleared individually.'
        remote: '[AI] The command `tea notifications unpin --remote` is a function in the Tea (Terminal Everywhere Anytime) application used for managing notifications across multiple devices and platforms. This command specifically unpins or removes the notification from the remote server, allowing it to no longer appear at the top of the notification list on any device synced with that account.'
        repo: '[AI] The `tea notifications unpin --repo` command is used in the Tea interface, a Git client for terminal users, to unpin a specific repository notification. This means that the notification for the given repository will no longer be displayed at the top of the list when new events occur. By specifying only the repository argument, this command applies to the currently selected or active repository.'
        states: |-
            [AI] The `tea notifications unpin --states` command in the Tea (short for Temporal Event Anderson) data processing framework is used to unpin multiple notifications with specific states from the event store.

            In other words, it allows you to remove the "pinned" status from several notifications that match the given state criteria, making them no longer at the top of the notification list and allowing new notifications to take their place as pinned notifications. This can be useful for managing large numbers of notifications in a complex event-driven system.
