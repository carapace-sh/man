    command: '[AI] `brew install` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is utilized to install software from Homebrew''s extensive repository, by downloading and compiling the source code or retrieving pre-compiled binary files if available. The installation process includes managing dependencies and handling any necessary configuration steps.'
    flag:
        HEAD: '[AI] `brew install --HEAD` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--HEAD` option tells Homebrew to install the latest, possibly unstable, version of a repository''s master branch from Git. This can be useful when you want to try out the very latest features or bug fixes, but keep in mind that it may introduce instability or compatibility issues.'
        adopt: '[AI] `brew install --adopt` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--adopt` option tells Homebrew to install software from pre-compiled binary files instead of building it from source. This results in faster installation times and potentially fewer issues as the binaries have already been tested and compiled for the target system. It also allows for easy updating of installed packages, as Homebrew only needs to manage symbols and ownerships, not compile code.'
        appdir: '[AI] `brew install --appdir` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command installs an application from Homebrew''s repositories and specifies the installation directory as `--appdir`. By default, Homebrew installs applications in the `/usr/local/Cellar` directory, but using `--appdir` allows you to install applications into a different custom location. This can be helpful if you want to keep your installations organized or need to comply with specific system requirements.'
        audio-unit-plugindir: '[AI] `brew install --audio-unit-plugindir` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command is used to install software that comes in the form of Audio Unit plugins, which are digital signal processing components that can be inserted into a digital audio workstation (DAW) or other audio applications to extend their functionality. The `--audio-unit-plugindir` option specifies the directory where Homebrew should install the plugins, typically `/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/Components`. Once installed, these plugins can be accessed and used in compatible DAWs and audio applications.'
        binaries: '[AI] `brew install --binaries` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command instructs Homebrew to download and install only the binary files (executable programs) for a specified package, without installing any dependencies or other components. The goal is to have just the executables needed, saving disk space and installation time.'
        bottle-arch: '[AI] `brew install --bottle-archive` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command instructs Homebrew to download and install the specified software from its repositories, but instead of installing it directly on the system, it creates an archive or bottle file containing the installed software and all its dependencies in a self-contained package. This bottle can then be easily shared or distributed to other systems without needing an internet connection or the original Homebrew installation.'
        build-bottle: '[AI] The `brew install --build-bottle` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. It installs a formula (a recipe for building and installing software) and also builds a bottle (precompiled binary) for that specific version of the formula. The bottled version can be installed later without having to build it from source again, which saves time and resources. This command ensures that both the source code and the precompiled binary are available for future use.'
        build-from-source: |-
            [AI] The command `brew install --build-from-source` is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command instructs Homebrew to install software from its source code rather than using a precompiled binary.

            Homebrew will first download the required source code from the internet, then it will compile and build the software from scratch using the system's resources (e.g., compiler, libraries). Once built successfully, Homebrew will install the software and manage it with its own tools such as updates and removal.

            Using `--build-from-source` allows for having the most up-to-date version of a software or even building custom configurations, but it might take more time compared to using precompiled binaries and requires a functional development environment.
        cask: '[AI] `brew install --cask` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command is used to install software that is distributed as a pre-compiled binary and packaged in the form of a "Cask". A Cask is essentially a bundle of metadata and a single file that points to the download location of the binary package. The `install` command with the `--cask` flag instructs Homebrew to download, verify, install, and manage this type of software package.'
        cc: '[AI] `brew install --cc` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `install` sub-command is used to download, build, and install software from the Homebrew repository. The `--cc` flag specifies that Homebrew should use a specific compiler (CC) other than Apple''s Xcode default clang during the installation process. This can be useful when working with projects requiring non-standard or older compilers.'
        colorpickerdir: |-
            [AI] The `brew install --colorpickerdir` command is not a valid option for Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. Instead, there are several options that can be used with the `install` command:

            1. `--deps`: Install dependencies of the specified formula in addition to it.
            2. `--force-reinstall`: Force reinstall the already installed package without asking any questions.
            3. `--HEAD`: Install the latest (possibly unstable) version from the Git repository instead of a released version.
            4. `--new-installdir`: Change the default installation directory.

            The term `--colorpickerdir` does not exist as an option for Homebrew. If you meant to ask about changing colorschemes or configuring terminal colors, consider using other tools like iTerm2 or the Terminal application's settings.
        debug: '[AI] `brew install --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--debug` flag enables detailed output during the installation process, providing more information about what Homebrew is doing behind the scenes.

This command simulates the installation process without actually installing the software or making any changes to your system. It shows you what packages would be installed and their dependencies, as well as any potential conflicts or errors that might occur during the actual installation. The output includes information about the files that would be downloaded and installed, as well as the total size of the installation. This command is useful for planning installations and understanding the impact on your system before making any permanent changes.'
        fetch-HEAD: '[AI] `brew install --fetch-HEAD` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command instructs Homebrew to install the latest head (development version) of a specific software from its Git repository instead of using the last stable release in the Homebrew repository. By fetching the HEAD, Homebrew will ensure that you get the very latest changes and updates from the source. Keep in mind that using development versions may come with added risks such as instability or compatibility issues, so it''s important to proceed with caution.'
        fontdir: '[AI] The `brew install --fontdir` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command installs a font package using Homebrew and sets the system-wide font directory to include the newly installed font files. In other words, it installs a font package and makes it available for use across the system.'
        force: '[AI] `brew install --force` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to install or update a specific package, even if it''s already installed or if there are potential conflicts. The `--force` flag overrides any previous installations and reinstalls the software from scratch, including fetching the latest version, checking its integrity, and installing dependencies. It can be useful when dealing with corrupted installations, dependency issues, or outdated packages.'
        force-bottle: |-
            [AI] The `brew install --force-bottle` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command forces Homebrew to install a formula and then bottle it, creating a ready-to-install bottle for offline use or distribution.

            When you run `brew install`, Homebrew downloads the required formula from its repositories and builds the software. However, if the software is not available online, or if you need an offline installation, you can use the `--force-bottle` option. This will make Homebrew attempt to install the formula from local bottles first; if it fails, it will build the software from source and bottle it for future use.

            In summary, `brew install --force-bottle` is used to install a formula with Homebrew, create a bottled version of that installation, and make the bottled version available for offline usage or distribution.
        formula: '[AI] `brew install --formula` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command installs software from a pre-compiled Homebrew formula, which contains instructions to build and install the software from source code.

        mdimporterdir: '[AI] `brew install --mLIEDumperdir` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command installs Homebrew formulae along with their dependent libraries directly from the Source-Available (Mojave) or Cellar (Catalina and newer) directories, bypassing caching. The `--mLIEDumperdir` option specifies that you want to install these dependencies into their respective directories instead of a standardized Cellar location. This can be useful in certain situations where you need finer control over the installation process or want to save disk space.'
        no-binaries: '[AI] The `brew install --no-binaries` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command instructs Homebrew not to download and install precompiled binary files during the installation process of a new package. Instead, it will download the source code and compile it locally on the user''s system. This can be useful when you want to customize the build process or if there are issues with precompiled binaries. The overall effect is that you have more control over the installation and potentially a more tailored setup.'
        no-quarantine: |-
            [AI] The `brew install --no-quarantine` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command overrides Homebrew's default security feature called "Quarantine" or "Gatekeeper."

            When you install software using Homebrew without the `--no-quarantine` flag, Homebrew will check the authenticity of the downloaded package by verifying its checksum against Apple's servers. If the checksum matches, it is considered safe to install. This helps protect your system from potentially malicious software.

            However, if you use `brew install --no-quarantine`, Homebrew will not perform this security check, allowing you to install the package regardless of its origin or authenticity. This bypasses Apple's Gatekeeper and can be risky as it might introduce insecure software into your system. It is recommended to only use this command when you trust the source of the package and understand the potential risks.
        only-dependencies: '[AI] The `brew install --only-dependencies` command is used in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. This specific command instructs Homebrew to install only the dependencies (i.e., required packages or libraries) of a given formula or cask, without actually installing that formula or cask itself. It helps in situations where one wants to satisfy dependency requirements without having the main application installed.'
        overwrite: '[AI] `brew install --overwrite` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command installation method forces Homebrew to overwrite an already existing installed package with a new version, even if the new version is not an improvement or has compatibility issues with existing dependencies. It can be useful when trying to upgrade a specific package to the latest version, but it comes with the risk of potential conflicts or unexpected errors. Use it with caution.'
        prefpanedir: |-
            [AI] `brew install --prefpanedir` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command modifies the preference pane directory installation location during the installation of Homebrew Cask packages.

            By including `--prefpanedir` option, the user can specify a custom directory path where the preference panes will be installed instead of the default system-wide location. For instance, `--prefpanedir ~/Library/Application Support/Homebrew-Cask` would install the preference panes in a personal directory, keeping them separate for different users on the same machine or for easier backups and synchronization between machines.
        qlplugindir: |-
            [AI] The `brew install --qlplugindir` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command installs Homebrew plugins using the Cask system, which manages the installation of graphical user interface (GUI) applications.

            The `--qlplugindir` option specifies the directory where Quartz Composer plugins will be installed after the plugin is installed via Homebrew Cask. Quartz Composer is an open-source visual programming language created by Apple for designing and prototyping interactive graphics and dynamic interfaces. By installing plugins using this command, users can easily extend the functionality of Quartz Composer.
        quarantine: '[AI] `brew install --quarantine` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--quarantine` option instructs Homebrew to install software from Apple''s Mac App Store or identified developers in a restricted state called quarantine. This means that Gatekeeper on the system will perform additional checks to ensure the software is safe before it can be fully used. The quarantine process helps maintain security by preventing potentially harmful applications from executing without user consent.'
        quiet: |-
            [AI] `brew install --quiet` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `install` sub-command is used to download and install software from Homebrew's repositories.

            The `--quiet` flag modifies the installation process by suppressing informational messages during the installation. This can make the terminal output cleaner and less cluttered, which can be useful when running multiple commands at once or if you prefer a quieter terminal session.
        require-sha: '[AI] The `brew install --require-sha` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command is employed to install software from Homebrew''s repositories while requiring the installation of a specific version identified by its SHA1 checksum. In other words, it ensures that only the exact version of the software, as defined by the given SHA1 hash, is installed. It enhances security and prevents potential issues that may arise from unintended updates or installations.'
        screen-saverdir: '[AI] `brew install` is a command used in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS, to install software from its repository. The option `--screen-saverdir` specifies the directory where Homebrew should install screen savers. This means that when you use this command followed by the name of a screen saver (for example, `brew install xscreensaver --screen-saverdir ~/Library/Application Support/Screen Savers`), Homebrew will download, compile, and install the screen saver software in the specified directory. This way, you can manage your screen savers using Homebrew alongside other installed applications.'
        servicedir: '[AI] The `brew install --servicedir` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command installs a Homebrew formula in a custom location called a "service directory." Instead of installing the formula into the default Cellar directory, it places the binary or daemon directly into `/Library/Brew/Services` or `~/Library/Brew/Services`. This setup is useful for managing system services and daemons with Homebrew. When you use this command, Homebrew will symlink the installed executable to `/Library/LaunchAgents` or `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, respectively, ensuring that it starts up automatically during system boot.'
        skip-cask-deps: |-
            [AI] The command `brew install --skip-cask-deps` is a modification of the standard Homebrew installation command used in macOS to install software packages from the Homebrew repository.

            The `--skip-cask-deps` flag tells Homebrew to skip installing dependencies that are listed as optional dependencies for Cask (Homebrew's package manager for GUI applications). These dependencies are often not essential for the core functionality of the installed application but can include additional tools or libraries. By skipping these dependencies, the installation process is made faster and the system remains leaner, which can be beneficial for users who prefer a minimal setup.

            Overall, `brew install --skip-cask-deps` is an optional command that allows you to choose whether or not to install Cask dependency packages during the Homebrew installation process.
        skip-post-install: '[AI] The `brew install --skip-post-install` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command instructs Homebrew to install the specified software package without running any post-installation tasks or scripts. The main purpose of skipping post-installation is when you encounter issues during the execution of these scripts or when you want a quicker installation process without dealing with potential dependencies or configuration changes that may be imposed by the scripts. However, keep in mind that some packages might require the post-installation steps to fully function correctly. Use this command with caution and only when necessary.'

This command installs software packages using Homebrew, with an added level of detail. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output displayed during the installation process. It provides real-time updates on each step taken during the installation, including download progress, validation checks, and other relevant information. This can be helpful for troubleshooting or understanding what Homebrew is doing when installing new software.'
        vst-plugindir: '[AI] The `brew install --vst-plugindir` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command is used to install VST plugins, which are virtual studio technology plugins for digital audio workstations. The `--vst-plugindir` option specifies the directory where the installed plugins will be placed. For example, `brew install --vst-plugindir="/Users/username/Music/VSTplugins" jausef-synth` would install Jausef Synth VST plugin to the specified directory.'
        vst3-plugindir: '[AI] `brew install --vst3-plugindir` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command instructs Homebrew to install software that includes VST3 audio plugins. The `--vst3-plugindir` flag specifies the directory where the installed plugins will be placed within the user''s system. By default, it is set to `~/Library/Audio/PlugIns/VST3`, but you can specify a custom path if needed. This command downloads, installs and sets up the required dependencies and configurations for the VST3 audio plugins.'
        zap: '[AI] `brew install --zap` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to install software with Homebrew, and then uninstall or "zap" it after the installation is complete. The `--zap` option tells Homebrew to not only install the software but also remove any previously installed versions and associated files or configurations. It''s useful when you want to ensure a clean installation or revert to a previous version.'
