documentation:
    command: '[AI] `terraform workspace delete` is a Terraform command used to remove an existing workspace by its name. Workspaces in Terraform are isolated sets of state for managing multiple configurations with different variables values. Deleting a workspace removes its associated state files and configuration data, effectively discarding any resources managed under that workspace. Use this command when you no longer need the specific configurations or resource setups associated with a particular workspace.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `terraform workspace delete -force` is a command in Hashicorp''s Terraform configuration management tool. It permanently deletes the specified Terraform workspace, including all its state data and configured resources. The `-force` flag bypasses any confirmation prompts before executing the delete operation. This command should be used with caution to avoid unintended destruction of configuration data or infrastructure.'
        lock: |-
            [AI] The `terraform workspace delete -lock` command is used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, to delete a locked workspace. A Terraform workspace is a separate configuration context for managing resources across multiple configurations.

            The `-lock` flag indicates that the associated workspace has been locked, meaning that no further operations can be performed on it unless the lock is released. When you run `terraform workspace delete -lock`, Terraform deletes the lock file associated with the selected workspace and makes it available for new configurations or operations.

            It's essential to understand that using this command removes the lock, which may lead to unintended consequences if other users are working in the same configuration. Always ensure that you communicate with your team and coordinate any potential workflow changes before deleting a locked workspace.
        lock-timeout: '[AI] `terraform workspace delete` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Terraform infrastructure configuration tool to delete an existing workspace. The `-lock-timeout` option sets the duration for which Terraform should hold a lock on the workspace before deleting it. If no other Terraform session is working on the workspace during this period, the workspace will be permanently deleted. This prevents accidental deletion of workspaces that are still in use.'
