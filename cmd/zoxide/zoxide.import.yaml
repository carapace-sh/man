documentation:
    command: '[AI] `zoxice import` is a command used in Zoxide, a zsh terminal utility for quick project navigation. This command imports a directory into your current zsh session as a zoxide location, allowing you to easily navigate to it using the `z` keyword followed by its name. It does not copy or move files from one place to another, but simply adds the new directory''s path to Zoxide''s database of locations.'
    flag:
        from: '[AI] `zoxide import --from` is a command used in the Zoxide terminal tool for managing multiple Python virtual environments. This command imports an existing Python environment defined by a `.zox2.yml` file into the current working directory. The `--from` option specifies the path to the source directory containing the `.zox2.yml` file. By importing an environment, Zoxide creates a new `.zox2.json` file and sets up the virtual environment for use in the current project.'
        help: '[AI] `zoxide import --help` is a command used with the Zoxide package in zsh, which is a faster and more efficient alternative to the standard Git submodule workflow for managing multiple working directory branches of a single repository. The `--help` flag displays detailed usage information about the `import` sub-command. It explains how to import a new project into your Zoxide worktree, specifying options such as the repository URL or local path, and sets up the necessary Git hooks for seamless branching and switching.'
        merge: '[AI] `zoxide import --merge` is a command used in the version control tool Zoxide. It imports files or directories into your Git repository, and merges any local changes with the imported content. This allows you to keep a consistent history while adding new files or updating existing ones. The `--merge` option automatically merges any local modifications with the imported content using Git''s merge capabilities.'
        version: '[AI] `zoxide import --version` is a command used with the Zoxide package manager for Zsh. It requests and displays the version number of the installed Zoxide package. The `import` keyword here is used to load Zoxide configuration and functions into the current terminal session, while `--version` is an option that triggers the display of version information.'
