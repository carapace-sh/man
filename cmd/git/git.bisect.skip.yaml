description: mark revisions as untestable
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `git bisect skip` command is used during a git bisect rebase operation to mark a specific commit as good, and tell Git Bisect to move on to the next potentially problematic commit without continuing the search in that direction. This can be helpful when you''ve identified the cause of a regression and don''t want Git Bisect to waste time inspecting commits that are not responsible for the issue.'
