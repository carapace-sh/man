documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `git imap-send` command is a Git feature that allows users to send notifications about their Git repository changes to an email mailing list using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP). This can be useful for keeping team members updated on repository activity or for making announcements about releases. To use this command, you must first have set up IMAP access for your Git repositories and configured your email client with your Git user identity and email address. After setting up these prerequisites, you can run `git imap-send <commit-message>` to send an email notification containing the specified commit message to the mailing list associated with your repository.'
    flag:
        curl: |-
            [AI] The `git imap-send --curl` command is used to send emails related to Git events using the CURL library instead of Git's built-in mail transport agent. Here's a brief explanation:

            1. `git`: This is the Git version control system command-line interface.
            2. `imap-send`: A subcommand in Git for sending notifications via email about events such as commits or pushes.
            3. `--curl`: An option indicating that CURL, a popular and versatile library used to make network requests, should be used instead of Git's built-in mail transport agent for sending emails. This allows for more flexibility when configuring the email headers, authentication, and other details.
        no-curl: '[AI] `git imap-send` is a Git subcommand used to send emails about repository events using the IMAP protocol instead of CURL. The `--no-curl` option disables the use of CURL and instructs Git to use only IMAP for sending emails. This can be useful when working in environments that restrict or don''t support CURL but still allow access to an IMAP server.'
        quiet: '[AI] `git imap-send` is a Git command used to send emails about repository events to a mailing list using the IMAP protocol. The `--quiet` option is used to suppress informational messages and only display errors during the execution of this command. In other words, it runs the command in quiet mode, with minimal output.'
        verbose: '[AI] `git imap-send` is a Git extension command used to send emails about repository events using the IMAP protocol. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output produced by the command, providing more detailed information about the email sending process. It''s helpful for debugging or understanding what exactly is happening during the email transmission.'
