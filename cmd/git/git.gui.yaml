    command: '[AI] `git gui` is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for the Git version control system. It provides an easy-to-use interface for performing common Git operations such as committing changes, creating and managing branches, and resolving merge conflicts. The tool is often used by developers who prefer working with a GUI instead of the command line. To use `git gui`, simply open it from your terminal or command prompt using the appropriate command for your operating system (e.g., `git gui &` on Unix-based systems), and it will display an intuitive interface that allows you to interact with your Git repositories in a visual way.'
