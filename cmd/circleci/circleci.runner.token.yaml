description: Operate on runner tokens
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `circleci runner token` is a security token used to authenticate CircleCI runners with CircleCI''s platform. When you add a new runner to your CircleCI project, you need to provide this token during the setup process so that the runner can communicate with CircleCI and access your workflows and jobs. The token acts as an identifier and permission key for the specific runner. Keep in mind that it is essential to keep your CircleCI runner tokens secure and avoid sharing them publicly or with unauthorized users, as they grant significant access to your CircleCI project.'
