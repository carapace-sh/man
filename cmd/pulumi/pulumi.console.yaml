    command: '[AI] `pulumi console` is a command-line interface tool for interacting with your Pulumi infrastructure as code projects in real time. It allows you to view, manipulate, and execute resources defined in your Pulumi stack files using familiar YAML or HCL syntax, without having to write or deploy new code. This can be useful for quick explorations, testing changes, or debugging issues within your infrastructure configuration before committing them to version control.'
