        [AI] `npm cache` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). It maintains a local cache of downloaded packages to speed up installation and save network bandwidth. The command offers several sub-commands:

        1. `clean` - Removes the cached data for all packages, clearing the cache.
        2. `verify` - Verifies the integrity of all cached packages.
        3. `list` - Lists the packages currently cached in the local repository.
        4. `prune` - Removes the cached packages that are no longer required due to dependency updates.
        5. Without any argument, it will list out the cache directory path and the size of the cache.
