documentation:
    command: '[AI] `newrelic nerdgraph query` is a command used in New Relic''s telemetry data processing language, Nerdgraph Query Language (NQL). It allows users to query and filter New Relic performance and infrastructure data stored in New Relic''s Insights service. The command takes an NQL query as its argument and returns the results of that query, which can be further processed or analyzed for gaining insights into application performance and infrastructure health.'
    flag:
        queryFile: '[AI] The `newrelic nerdgraph query --queryFile` command is used in New Relic''s Nerdgraph data query language to execute a query defined in a file instead of specifying it directly on the command line. This can be useful for managing and executing complex queries, especially in large-scale monitoring environments. The `--queryFile` option takes the path to the file containing the Nerdgraph query as an argument.'
        variables: '[AI] `newrelic nerdgraph query --variables` is a command used in New Relic, a performance monitoring tool. This command executes a Nerdgraph query with specified variables to retrieve and manipulate data from New Relic''s instrumented applications. The `--variables` option allows users to pass custom key-value pairs as variables to the query for dynamic filtering or manipulation of query results.'
        variablesFile: '[AI] The `newrelic nerdgraph query` command is a part of New Relic''s observability platform, which allows users to run complex queries against their telemetry data. The option `--variablesFile` specifies a JSON file containing custom variable definitions for use in the query. These variables can be referenced within the query to filter and manipulate data based on specific conditions. By providing this file, users can make their queries more dynamic and flexible.'
