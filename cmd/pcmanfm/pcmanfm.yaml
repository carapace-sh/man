Additionally, it supports multiple views (icon, list, and detail), can handle archives, and has built-in text editor for editing files on the fly.'
    flag:
        class: |-
            [AI] The `--class` option in the `pcmanfm` command is used to specify a custom class name for a window managed by the file manager. This can be useful when applying custom settings or rules using desktop environments or window managers that support window class names, such as GNOME or XFCE. For example:

            ```
            pcmanfm --class="MyCustomClass" /path/to/directory
            ```

            This command opens the file manager with the specified directory and sets the window class name to "MyCustomClass".
        daemon-mode: '[AI] `pcmanfm --daemon-mode` is a command used in Linux systems to start the pcmanfm file manager as a background service or daemon. When run with this option, pcmanfm continues to operate even after the terminal session is closed, providing persistent file management functionality. This can be useful for creating custom desktop shortcuts, automating tasks, or running file management operations in the background.'
        desktop: '[AI] `pcmanfm --desktop` is a command used in Linux systems to open the file manager, pcmanfm, with the desktop as the default view or tab. The "--desktop" option specifies that pcmanfm should be opened displaying the user''s desktop files and folders. It provides a graphical interface for users to navigate, manage, and interact with their files on the desktop environment.'
        desktop-off: '[AI] `pcmanfm --desktop-off` is a command used in Linux systems with the PCMan File Manager (pcmanfm). This command is used to hide the file manager desktop icons, making the desktop appear empty or minimalist. It does not affect the functionality of the file manager itself, which can still be accessed through other means such as the application menu or by typing `pcmanfm` in a terminal window.'
        desktop-pref: '[AI] `pcmanfm --desktop-pref` is a command used in Linux systems to open the file manager, pcmanfm, with the desktop preferences dialog. This dialog allows users to customize various settings related to the appearance and behavior of their desktop environment, such as the wallpaper, icon size, and workspace configuration. By running this command in a terminal, users can access these preferences directly from the file manager interface.'
        display: '[AI] `pcmanfm --display` is a command used in Linux systems to open the file manager, pcmanfm, and display a specific directory or file as its initial view. The option "--display" followed by a path specifies the desired directory to be displayed when the file manager is launched. For example, `pcmanfm --display /home/user/Documents` would open the file manager with the user''s Documents directory as the initial view.'
        find-files: '[AI] `pcmanfm --find-files` is a command used in Linux systems with the PCMan File Manager (pcmanfm). It launches the file manager with the specific option to initiate a search for files and directories that match a given pattern or regular expression, without opening any file or directory. The output displays the matching files and directories in a list format, allowing easy navigation and selection.'
        g-fatal-warnings: '[AI] `pcmanfm --g-fatal-warnings` is a command-line option used with the file manager PCManFM in the Linux distribution LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment). This option instructs PCManFM to display only fatal warnings instead of informational or non-fatal warning messages. It aims to minimize distractions and keep the user focused on critical issues while working with the file manager.'
        gtk-module: '[AI] `pcmanfm --gtk-module` is a command used in Linux systems to launch the file manager application, pcmanfm, with the GTK+ user interface module enabled. GTK+ (GIMP Toolkit) is a popular graphical user interface toolkit for creating applications. By using this command, users can ensure that pcmanfm utilizes the GTK+ interface when it runs, providing a consistent look and feel with other GTK+-based applications on their desktop environment.'
        help: '[AI] `pcmanfm --help` is a command used in Linux systems to display the help information for the pcmanfm file manager. When executed with this argument, pcmanfm will print out detailed usage instructions and information about its various features and options. It can be used to quickly reference how to use the file manager effectively and efficiently.'
        help-all: '[AI] `pcmanfm --help-all` is a command used in Linux systems to display comprehensive help information for the pcmanfm file manager. The `--help-all` option requests that all available options and their descriptions be shown, providing users with a complete reference for using pcmanfm effectively.'
        help-gtk: '[AI] `pcmanfm --help-gtk` is a command used in Linux and Unix-based systems to display help information for using the pcmanfm file manager with the GTK+ graphical user interface (GUI). The GTK+ interface allows users to interact with the file manager through a point-and-click desktop environment. This command is typically used when users need assistance in navigating and managing files with the GTK+ version of pcmanfm.'
        name: '[AI] `pcmanfm --name` is a command used in Linux distributions that utilize the PCMan File Manager (pcmanfm). This command is specifically used to display the names of all open windows or tabs of pcmanfm in the terminal. The output will list each window''s title, which typically reflects the current directory or other context information for the files being managed within that window.'
        new-win: '[AI] `pcmanfm --new-win` is a command used in Linux systems with the PCMan File Manager (pcmanfm). This command opens a new instance or window of pcmanfm. By using `--new-win`, you can have multiple instances of the file manager running simultaneously, allowing for easier multitasking and organization of directories or files.'
        no-desktop: '[AI] `pcmanfm --no-desktop` is a command used in Linux systems, specifically for the file manager called pcmanfm. The "--no-desktop" option instructs the file manager to launch without opening the desktop view or interface. This can be useful when using the file manager from a terminal session or script, as it allows you to focus on the files and directories without any extra desktop clutter.'
        one-screen: '[AI] `pcmanfm --one-screen` is a command used in Linux systems to open the file manager, pcmanfm, with only one tab or window in the interface. This option can be useful for those who prefer working with a single view of their files and directories at a time.

        role: |-
            [AI] `pcmanfm --role` is a command-line option for the file manager PCManFM in Linux distributions using the XFCE desktop environment. The `--role` option specifies the role of the window when it's opened:

            * `--role=file-manager` opens the file manager in the default mode, allowing users to navigate the file system and manage files.
            * `--role=terminal` opens a terminal emulator within the file manager window, merging the functionalities of both applications into one.
            * `--role=link` opens the file manager as a link preview pane in Thunar or Dolphin file managers, allowing users to preview links without opening them in an external browser.

            This option helps customize the user experience by adapting the window behavior based on the task at hand.
        screen: '[AI] `pcmanfm --screen` is a command used in Linux systems to open the file manager, pcmanfm, in full-screen mode. The option `--screen` ensures that the file manager window takes up the entire desktop area when launched.'
        set-wallpaper: '[AI] `pcmanfm --set-wallpaper` is a command used in Linux systems with the PCMan File Manager (pcmanfm). It sets a new wallpaper image for the desktop environment by opening the file manager and allowing the user to select an image file, which will then be set as the desktop background.'
        show-pref: '[AI] `pcmanfm --show-pref` is a command used in the Linux file manager, PCManFM.
