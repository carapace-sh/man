documentation:
    command: '[AI] `charms-fs cp` is a command from Juju''s Charm Helm (Charms File System) that is used to copy files and directories between two locations in a Juju Charmed Storage (CS) backstage or between local and CS storage. The syntax of the command is: `charms-fs cp <source> <destination>`. For instance, `charms-fs cp myfile.txt mynewfile.txt` will create a copy named `mynewfile.txt` of `myfile.txt` in the same location. When copying between CS backstages or local and CS storage, use the full URLs of the sources and destinations.'

            [AI] The `charm` is not a flag but rather a charms manager in Charms, a technology used in Canonical's Juju deployment model for managing applications and services in cloud environments. The `fs.cp --recursive` command under it is a custom charm helper script for performing a recursive file copy operation.

            Here's an explanation of the `fs.cp --recursive` command:

            1. `fs.`: Prefix indicating that this is a Charm Helper, which is a utility function provided by Juju's Charms for use within the charm.
            2. `cp`: Stands for 'copy'. This is the name of the helper function, specifically used to copy files or directories.
            3. `--recursive`: An option that makes the command perform a recursive file copy operation, meaning it will copy not only the specified file or directory but also all its subdirectories and their contents.
