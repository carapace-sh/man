documentation:
    command: '[AI] `circleci local execute` is a CircleCI command used to run scripts or commands locally on your development machine instead of in the CircleCI environment. It allows you to test configurations, build artifacts, or perform other tasks before pushing changes to your repository. The command takes an optional argument specifying the path to the script file to be executed. For example: `circleci local execute --local reactor myscript.sh`. This command is useful for debugging and testing scenarios where running scripts locally can save time and resources compared to using CircleCI''s virtual environment.'
    flag:
        branch: '[AI] The `circleci local execute --branch` command is a feature of CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform. This specific command allows users to runCircleCI jobs locally instead of on the CircleCI cloud. The `--branch` flag indicates which Git branch to use for the local execution. By using this command, developers can test changes locally before merging them into their main branch or running pipelines on CircleCI, saving time and resources.'
        checkout-key: '[AI] `circleci local execute --checkout-key` is a command used in CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform. This command allows running CircleCI workflows locally instead of on the CircleCI servers. The `--checkout-key` option is used to specify a particular Git checkout key to use for the local execution. This key is used to authenticate and retrieve the necessary code and configuration for the project from a Git repository, ensuring that the local environment mirrors the one in the production CircleCI setup.'
        config: '[AI] `circleci local execute --config` is a command used in CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform. This command allows running CircleCI workflows locally on your machine instead of in the cloud. The `--config` option specifies the path to a `.circleci/config.yml` file, which defines the workflow steps and jobs for the project. By using this command, you can test your changes to the configuration file locally before pushing them back to the main repository.'
        env: '[AI] `circleci local execute --env` is a command used in CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform. This command allows running scripts or commands locally on your machine before pushing changes to your repository. The `--env` flag sets environment variables for the local execution. These variables will be available to the running script or command. This can be useful for testing configurations that depend on specific environment settings or credentials.'
        index: '[AI] `circleci local execute --index` is a command used in CircleCI, a popular continuous integration and delivery platform. This command is used to run tests or scripts locally before pushing changes to the main repository. The `--index` flag specifies that the command should be executed using the latest Docker image from the CircleCI registry, without building it from source. It''s important to note that this command is not intended for use in production environments and should only be used for development or testing purposes.'
        job: '[AI] `circleci local execute --job` is a command used in CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform. This command allows executing a single job locally instead of running it on CircleCI''s servers. The `--job` option specifies the name or index of the job to be run. This can be helpful for debugging or testing purposes before deploying changes to production.'
        node-total: '[AI] The `circleci local execute --node-total` command is a part of CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform. This specific command is used to run jobs locally on a single machine instead of in the cloud. The `--node-total` option specifies the maximum number of parallel jobs that can be executed at once. This command allows developers to test their projects locally with similar conditions as CircleCI''s continuous integration environment, enabling faster feedback and development iterations.'
        org-slug: |-
            [AI] The `circleci local execute --org-slug` command is a part of CircleCI's CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. This command allows users to run jobs locally, mimicking the continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) processes that would occur on CircleCI's servers.

            The `--org-slug` option is used to specify the organization context within CircleCI. It is a unique identifier assigned to each organization in CircleCI. By providing this option, you ensure that the local execution uses the correct configuration, access rights, and project settings from your CircleCI organization.
        repo-url: |-
            [AI] The `circleci local execute --repo-url` command is a part of CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform. This specific command is used to run CircleCI tests and scripts locally instead of in the cloud.

            The `--repo-url` option specifies the GitHub or other version control repository URL where the project code is located. The command fetches the repository, checks out the specified branch or tag, sets up dependencies, and runs the tests defined in the `.circleci/config.yml` file locally on the developer's machine for faster feedback and iterations before pushing changes to the main branch.
        revision: '[AI] `circleci local execute --revision` is a command used in CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform. This command allows executing local tests or scripts on a specific revision of a project''s Git repository, outside the CircleCI environment. The `--revision` option specifies the commit SHA or branch name to use for the local execution. This command can be helpful when debugging issues that only occur in certain commits or branches, and when quick testing is required before pushing changes to the main branch.'
        skip-checkout: '[AI] `circleci local execute --skip-checkout` is a command used in CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform. This command allows running a script locally on your machine without checking out the code from the repository first. The `--skip-checkout` option skips the checkout process to save time and resources. It''s often used when you want to run tests or build scripts that don''t require the full CircleCI environment or the latest code changes.'
        volume: '[AI] `circleci local execute --volume` is a command used in CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform. This command runs a single CircleCI job locally instead of on the CircleCI cloud. The `--volume` flag allows for mounting one or more directories from the local file system into the container where the job will be executed. By doing so, it enables sharing data between the local environment and the containerized job, making it useful when working with large datasets, custom configurations, or specific tools not available on CircleCI''s virtual environments.'
