documentation:
    command: '[AI] `conda init` is a command provided by Anaconda''s Conda packaging and dependency management system. It configures your shell environment to use Conda for managing environments and installing packages. The command sets up various shell functions and configuration files based on the active shell (Bash, Zsh, etc.) for seamless integration with Conda. This allows users to easily create, activate, and manage Conda environments from their terminal or command prompt.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `conda init --all` is a command used in Anaconda or Miniconda distribution of Python and its packages management system, Conda. This command modifies various configuration files in your system to allow seamless integration of Conda with different shell environments such as Bash or Zsh. The `--all` flag instructs the script to modify all detected shell configurations present in your system. This simplifies setting up Conda environment activations across multiple terminals and shell sessions.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `conda init --dry-run` is a command used in Anaconda or Miniconda distributions to preview the changes that would be made by the `conda init` command without actually executing those changes. The `--dry-run` option provides an overview of what files would be modified, allowing users to review and make adjustments if necessary before running the actual command. This can help prevent unintended consequences when configuring the environment for various shells or IDEs.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `conda init` is a command in Anaconda's conda package management system used to configure various aspects of the environment for different shells (like bash, zsh, etc.). The `--help` flag provides information about how to use this command with available options. In brief:

            - `conda init [--file FILE] [SHELL]`: Initialize or configure a conda environment for specified shell, optionally specifying a custom file.
            - `--prefix PATH`: Set the base installation directory (default is system site-specific location).
            - `--dry-run`: Display what would be done without actually making changes.
            - `--help`: Show help information for this command and its available options.
        json: '[AI] `conda init --json` is a command used in Anaconda or Miniconda distributions of the Conda package manager to configure integration between the Conda environment management system and various shells (like Bash or Zsh). The `--json` option generates a JSON file containing the configuration instructions instead of modifying the shell files directly. This file can then be easily sourced, versioned, and shared among different environments or machines.'
        quiet: '[AI] `conda init` is a command used in Anaconda or Miniconda distributions of the Conda package manager to configure the environment setup for various shells (like Bash, Zsh, etc.). The `--quiet` flag is an optional argument that requests the script to run quietly without displaying any informational messages during execution. In essence, it suppresses all non-error messages for a cleaner and more focused terminal output.'
        reverse: '[AI] `conda init --reverse` is a command used in Anaconda/Miniconda distributions to configure the environment activation for shells like Bash or Zsh. The `--reverse` option swaps the order of execution between your system PATH and the conda environment PATH, meaning that conda environments will be activated before the system PATH is sourced. This configuration can be useful when you prefer to have your conda environments active by default over other installed packages or tools in your system.'
        verbose: '[AI] `conda init --verbose` is a command used in Anaconda or Miniconda distributions of the Conda package manager. This command configures your shell environment to use Conda for managing and creating new environments and installing packages. The `--verbose` option increases the output of the command, providing more detailed information about the initialization process. In summary, this command sets up Conda in your shell environment with enhanced verbosity for better understanding of the configuration steps.'
