documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `apt-get dselect-upgrade` command is a Debian package management tool that combines the functions of `apt-get update` and `apt-get dist-upgrade`. It updates the package index files using `update`, and then upgrades the system packages, handling dependencies and conflicts using the `dselect` (Debian Select) interface. This command is especially useful when managing multiple packages or repositories and ensures that the entire system is updated with the latest packages from the selected sources.'
