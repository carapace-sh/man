name: push
description: copy local files/directories to device
flags:
    --sync: only push files that are newer on the host than the device
    -Z: disable compression
    -n: 'dry run: push files to device without storing to the filesystem'
    -z=: enable compression with a specified algorithm (any, none, brotli)
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `adb push` is a command-line tool in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) that allows users to transfer files from their local machine to an Android device. The basic syntax is `adb push <local_file> <device_destination>`. For example, `adb push myfile.txt /sdcard/myfile.txt` would copy the local file named "myfile.txt" in the current directory on your machine to the "/sdcard/myfile.txt" location on your connected Android device.'
    flag:
        Z: '[AI] The command `adb push -Z <local-file> <device-destination>` in Android Debug Bridge (adb) is used to transfer a file from the local machine to an Android device. The `-Z` flag enables compressing the data during transfer using gzip compression, which helps reduce bandwidth usage and transmission time without significantly increasing the risk of data corruption or loss.'
        "n": '[AI] `adb push` is a command-line tool that comes with the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). It''s used to transfer files between a local machine and an Android device. The `-n` option, short for "no overwrite," tells `adb push` not to replace an existing file on the device if it has the same name as the local file being pushed. Instead, it appends a numeric suffix to the file name to make it unique. This can be useful when pushing multiple files with the same base name. For example: `adb push myfile.txt mydevice:/mnt/sdcard/myfolder/`. If `myfile.txt` already exists on the device, it will be renamed as `myfile.txt-1`, `myfile.txt-2`, etc., to avoid overwriting the original file.'
        sync: '[AI] `adb push --sync` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (adb). It transfers a file or directory from the local system to the Android device, synchronizing the destination path if it already exists on the device. The `--sync` option ensures that any existing files or directories with the same name on the device are overwritten without asking for confirmation. This command is useful for pushing and updating files in an automated way on Android devices.'
        z: '[AI] `adb push` is a command-line tool that comes with the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) package, used to transfer files between a local and a remote device (usually an Android device). The `-z` option stands for "compressed" mode, which means the data being transferred will be compressed before it''s sent over. This can save bandwidth and time during large file transfers. For example, `adb push <local_file> <remote_path> -z` would compress and send the local file to the remote device for storage in the specified path.'
