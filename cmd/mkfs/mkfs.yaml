documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `mkfs` command is used in Unix-based systems to create a new file system format on a given device or partition. It stands for "make file system." The user must have appropriate permissions to execute this command, and specifying the correct filesystem type (such as `ext4`, `xfs`, `ntfs`, etc.) is essential in the command''s arguments. Once executed, all data on the target device will be erased, so use with caution. For example, `mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdc1` creates an Ext4 file system on the given partition (`/dev/sdc1`).'

        help: |-
            [AI] `mkfs` is a command-line utility in Linux for creating new file systems. The `--help` option, when used with `mkfs`, displays detailed information about how to use the `mkfs` command, including:

            1. Valid filesystem types (e.g., ext4, xfs, btrfs).
            2. Syntax for specifying the device or file to create a file system on.
            3. Optional arguments and their descriptions, such as `-L` (label) and `-F` (force).
            4. Explanation of each argument, including what it does and any required values.
            5. Examples of using `mkfs` for different filesystem types.

            The help text is comprehensive and can be used to understand how to use the `mkfs` command correctly with various options to create specific file systems.
        type: '[AI] `mkfs --type` is a command used in Linux file systems to create a new file system on a given device or partition. The `--type` option specifies the file system type, such as `ext4`, `xfs`, `ntfs`, etc., that will be formed on the target device. After running this command, the specified file system will be formatted and ready for use.'
        verbose: '[AI] `mkfs --verbose` is a command used in Linux to create a new file system on a given device or partition. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output displayed during the file system creation process, providing more detailed information about each step taken. This can be helpful for debugging purposes or for gaining insight into how the file system is being formatted.'
        version: '[AI] `mkfs --version` is a command used in Linux and Unix-based systems to display the version information of the mkfs (Make File System) utility. This command allows users to check which version of the file system formatting tool is installed on their system. It does not create or format any file systems but only displays the version details.'
