        [AI] `xdotool` is a powerful and versatile tool for automating interactive tasks in the X Window System. The `set_desktop_for_window` command is used to change the desktop or workspace assignment of an open window.

        The basic syntax is: `xdotool set_desktop <window ID> <desktop number>`

        * `<window ID>` can be obtained by using other xdotool commands like `search` or `focusget`. This identifies the specific window you want to move.
        * `<desktop number>` refers to the workspace or virtual screen where you wish to place the window. The numbering starts from 0, representing the primary desktop.

        For instance: `xdotool search --name "Google Chrome" set_desktop 1` will move the Google Chrome window to workspace 1 (the second desktop).
