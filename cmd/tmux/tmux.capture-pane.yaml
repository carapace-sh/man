documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux capture-pane` is a TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) command used to take a screenshot of an individual pane within a TMUX session. This command captures the image as a PNG file and saves it with a default name in the current working directory, usually prefixed with `tmux-`. To use it, first attach to your TMUX session with `tmux attach`, then identify the pane you wish to capture using the pane number or identifier, and execute the command: `tmux capture-pane [-pane-id | -t target_window] [-S source_socket] [-q] [-W width] [-H height] [-F fileprefix]`. Optional parameters can be used to specify customizing options such as output format (besides PNG) or the filename.'
    flag:
        C: '[AI] `tmux capture-pane` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that takes a screenshot of an individual pane within a Tmux session. The `-C` option stands for "capture-pane-as-image", meaning this command will capture and save the image as a file in PPM (Portable Pixel Map) format by default, which is a raw pixel data format. You can redirect the output to another file or use other options for saving it in different formats like PNG or JPG.'
        E: '[AI] `tmux capture-pane` is a Tmux command used to take a screenshot or record a video of an active pane in a Tmux session. The option `-E` stands for "edit" and is used with the screenshot feature. When this option is provided, the captured image is opened in an external editor (specified by the $EDITOR environment variable) after being taken, allowing modifications before saving or further processing.'
        J: '[AI] `tmux capture-pane` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to capture the output of a pane as an image or binary data. The `-J` option is used to capture the entire pane, including the terminal padding and status bar, creating a more accurate representation of the displayed output.'
        "N": '[AI] `tmux capture-pane` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that captures the output of a specific pane within a Tmux session and saves it to a file with the `-N` (no prefix) option, creating a new file each time it''s used. The captured output is saved as plain text by default. This command can be useful for saving terminal output for later reference or for sharing command results in scripts.'
        P: '[AI] `tmux capture-pane` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer that takes a screenshot of an individual pane within a TMUX session. The `-P` option indicates that only the selected pane''s output, not its surrounding borders or other decorations, should be included in the captured image. This can be useful for saving the contents of a pane to a file or transferring it over the internet without the extra window dressing.'
        S: '[AI] `tmux capture-pane` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to take a snapshot of an active pane (a part of a terminal window) and save it as an image file. The `-S` option specifies the prefix for the output file name. For example, `tmux capture-pane -S my_prefix .png` will create an image named "my\_prefix.png" in the current directory.'
        a: '[AI] `tmux capture-pane` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer software. The `-a` option argues against the default behavior, which is to capture only the first pane in the current window. With the `-a` flag, all panes in the current window are captured instead, producing multiple images or outputs as separate files or pipes. So, `tmux capture-pane -a` captures images/output of all panes within the current Tmux window.'
        b: '[AI] `tmux capture-pane` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that captures an image or video of a specific pane within a Tmux session. The `-b` option stands for "background," meaning it captures the content of the pane without the border or other decorations around it, providing a clean and uncluttered image.'
        e: '[AI] `tmux capture-pane` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to take a screenshot of an individual pane within a Tmux session. The `-e` flag modifies the output format to base64-encoded data which can be easily embedded in various formats like emails or messages. So, `tmux capture-pane -e` command takes a screenshot of the current pane and returns the base64-encoded image data.'
        p: '[AI] The `tmux capture-pane` command with the `-p` option in TMUX is used to take a screenshot of an individual pane within a TMUX terminal session. The `-p` flag specifies that only the selected pane''s content should be captured, not the surrounding window or terminal borders. This results in a cropped image that can be saved and used for various purposes such as sharing, debugging, or documentation.'
        q: '[AI] `tmux capture-pane` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that captures an image of a specific pane within a Tmux session. The `-q` option makes it run quietly without displaying any output or progress message. So, `tmux capture-pane -q <pane_number>` will save an image of the specified pane as a binary file named `tmux-<pane_number>.png` in the current directory.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux capture-pane` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer, used to take a screenshot of an individual pane within a Tmux session. The `-t` option specifies which pane to capture. For example, `tmux capture-pane -t 0.1` would take a screenshot of pane 1 in the first window of your Tmux session.'
