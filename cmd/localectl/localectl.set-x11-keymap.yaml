description: Set X11 and console keyboard mappings
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `localectl` is a system utility in Linux for managing localization and regional settings. The specific command `localectl set-x11-keymap` is used to configure the X11 keyboard layout. This means it sets the keymap for the graphical user interface (GUI) of your Linux system, which can be useful if you want to use a different keyboard layout when using applications in a GUI environment, compared to the system-wide setting. You would provide the desired keymap as an argument to this command. For example: `localectl set-x11-keymap us:utf8` sets the US English (UTF-8) keymap for the X11 environment.'
