documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea notifications pin` command in the Tea application is used to mark a specific notification as pinned. This means that the notification will remain at the top of your notification list, ensuring it is easily accessible and visible even as new notifications come in.'
    flag:
        limit: '[AI] The `--limit` option in the `tea notifications pin` command is used to specify the maximum number of notifications to keep pinned in Tea, a cross-platform terminal client for GitHub and other services. By default, Tea keeps only the last 10 notifications pinned. You can use this option to change that limit by providing a number as an argument, e.g., `--limit 25` to keep 25 notifications pinned instead.'
        login: '[AI] The `--login` flag for the `tea notify` command in the Tea (Terminal Emulator Application) tool is used to authenticate and log into a Tea account or workspace. The `--pin` option follows it, allowing users to provide a notification pin code for two-factor authentication if that feature is enabled on their account. Together, these flags enable the user to receive notifications from their Tea account in their terminal with secure authentication.'
        mine: '[AI] The `--mine` flag for the `tea notifications pin` command in Tea, a popular terminal productivity application, specifies that only notifications related to files or directories belonging to the current user should be displayed. This allows users to filter out irrelevant notifications and focus on those related to their own projects or work.'
        output: |-
            [AI] The `--flag tea notifications pin --output` is a command-line argument used in various tools, typically those related to Git or other version control systems. This flag does two things:

            1. It enables the "Tea" notifications feature. Tea notifications are real-time event notifications that alert users about specific Git events as they occur. These notifications can be sent via email, Slack, or other messaging platforms.
            2. It sets the output format to 'pin' or 'sticky' notifications, meaning that the notifications will remain visible until explicitly dismissed. This is useful for ensuring important notifications do not get overlooked in a sea of other messages.
        page: '[AI] The `--page tea notifications pin` flag is used with the `tea` command-line tool for GitHub in a Unix-like environment. This flag pins a specific notification on a GitHub repository''s page so that it stays at the top when new notifications arrive.'
        remote: '[AI] The `--tea-notifications-pin --remote` flag is used with Tea, a popular terminal interface for GitHub. It indicates that notifications for specific repositories or events should be pinned to the top of the Tea interface, regardless of their remote location. This allows users to easily keep track of important updates in their repositories without having to constantly switch between them.'
        repo: '[AI] The `--teanotifications-pin --repo` flag is used with Git commands, specifically with the `git fetch` or `git pull` commands, in the context of using GitHub''s "Teas" feature for notifications. This flag keeps the local repository pinned to the remote repository, ensuring that any new branches created on the remote repository are automatically tracked and fetched, along with their associated notifications (or "Teas"). This can be useful for staying up-to-date with collaborators'' activities on a shared project.'
        states: |-
            [AI] The `--states` option in the `tea notifications pin` command is used to manage the states of specific notification pins in Tea, an open-source CLI tool for managing notifications from various sources.

            With this option, you can list all the pins and their current states using `--list`, mark a pin as read or unread using `mark [pin] [read|unread]`, or clear all read marks using `clear`. The state of a pin indicates whether or not it has been read by the user.
