description: Add a new domain that you already own
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vercel domains add` command is used in Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, to add a custom domain name to an existing project. This allows users to connect their projects to a personalized domain instead of the default one provided by Vercel. To use this command, you need to have the Vercel CLI installed and authenticated, then run `vercel domains add <your-custom-domain>` in your terminal, replacing `<your-custom-domain>` with the desired custom domain name. After execution, Vercel will validate the domain and create a DNS record for it if successful.'
