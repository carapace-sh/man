        [AI] The `newrelic profile delete` command is used in New Relic's command-line tools to delete a specific application or browser profile from New Relic. Profiles represent applications or browsers being monitored, and deleting one will remove its associated data. To use this command, first, ensure you have the New Relic CLI installed and configured with proper credentials. Then, run the command with the unique identifier (ID or name) of the profile to be deleted as an argument:

        ```
        newrelic-infra delete profile [<profile_id> | <profile_name>]
        ```

        This action is permanent and irreversible. Be cautious when using this command, as deleting a profile will remove all data associated with it.
