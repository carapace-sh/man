        [AI] `glab` is a Git command-line tool for working with GitHub and other version control platforms from the terminal. The `variable get` subcommand is used to retrieve the value of a GitHub repository's environment variable.

        This command takes one argument, which is the name of the variable. It returns the value of that variable as output. For example:
        ```bash
        glab variable get MY_VAR
        ```
        This command will print out the current value for the `MY_VAR` variable associated with your GitHub repository. If you don't have access to the repository or the variable doesn't exist, you will receive an error message.

            [AI] The `glab` command is a Git interface tool for the popular text editor and version control system, VSCode. The specific command `glab variable get --group` is used to retrieve the value of an environment variable or secret stored in Git Secrets manager.

            The `--group` option filters the output by displaying only the variables belonging to a specific group. This can be useful when dealing with multiple groups of secrets, allowing for more organized access and management.

            In summary, `glab variable get --group [GROUP_NAME]` retrieves the value(s) of secret variables that belong to the specified Git Secrets manager group.
        scope: '[AI] The `glab` command is a Git interface for the `kubectl` tool, which allows managing Kubernetes resources using Git operations. The `flag "glab variable get --scope"` is used to retrieve the value of a specific Kubernetes variable from a given scope, such as a namespace or a Git branch. It fetches the variable definition from the selected Git ref (branch or commit) and applies the given scope filter to return only the variables that match the specified scope. The output displays the name and value of the variable.'
