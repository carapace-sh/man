documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `lastlog` command in Unix and Linux systems is used to display the last login records for each user account. It reads and displays the contents of the system-wide or per-user `lastlog` file, which stores details such as the username, terminal device, IP address, and login time for each login session. By default, it shows the 10 most recent login records per user. If no argument is provided, it displays information for all users. You can also specify a particular username to view only that user''s login history.'
    flag:
        before: '[AI] The `lastlog --before` command is a Unix utility used to display the login records of a user prior to a specific time. The command takes a timestamp argument, which can be specified in various formats such as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" or "N days ago". For example, `lastlog --before "10 days ago"` will show the login history for the current user before the last 10 days. This command helps in monitoring and troubleshooting system security issues related to unauthorized user access.'
        clear: '[AI] The `lastlog --clear` command is used to clear the last login records of a user account in Unix-based systems. The `lastlog` utility maintains a record of users'' login and logout activities, storing this information in the system file `/var/log/wtmp` or `/var/log/lastlog`. By executing `lastlog --clear <username>`, the last login records for the specified user will be deleted, ensuring their previous login history is no longer accessible.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `lastlog` is a Linux command used to display the login history of users on the system. The `--help` option, when used with this command, provides information about how to use it effectively. Here's a brief explanation:

            - `lastlog --help`: Displays help information for the lastlog command.
            - Options: There are no mandatory options for using lastlog. However, you can specify the username of the user whose login history you want to view using the -u option (`lastlog -u <username>`).

            Usage examples:

            - `lastlog`: Displays the login history of the current user.
            - `lastlog username`: Displays the login history for the specified user.

            Help output will include details about these uses, along with any other available options or flags.
        root: '[AI] The `lastlog` command with the `--root` option is used in Unix-based systems to display the last login records for all users on the system, instead of just the current user. The option `--root` specifies that you want to view the logs for all users under the root directory (`/var/log/lastlog`) where the login files are stored, rather than in the individual user-specific directories (`~/.lastlogin`). This provides a centralized and more comprehensive view of the system''s login activity.'
        set: '[AI] The `lastlog --set` command is a Linux utility used to update the last login timestamp for a specific user account in the system''s last login database file (usually located at /var/log/wtmp or /var/log/lastlog). It sets the last login time to the current time. This command can be useful when manually changing the system clock or when troubleshooting login issues, as it ensures that the last login timestamp for a user is accurate.'
        time: |-
            [AI] The `lastlog --time` command is used in Unix-based systems to display the last login times for user accounts, showing the timestamp of each login session. The output typically includes the username, the terminal or IP address from which the user logged in, and the login time. For example:

            ```bash
            user1 pts/001 08/Feb/2023:14:35:27 +0200
            user2 pts/01 08/Feb/2023:16:12:34 +0200
            ...
            ```

            This output indicates that `user1` last logged in on terminal `pts/001` at 14 hours, 35 minutes, and 27 seconds on February 8th, 2023, while `user2` last logged in on terminal `pts/01` at 16 hours, 12 minutes, and 34 seconds. The '+0200' represents the UTC time with a two-hour offset for the local timezone.
        user: '[AI] The `lastlog` command in Unix-based systems is used to display or manage user login records. When you use the option `--user <username>`, it filters the output to show only the login records for that specific user. This helps in monitoring and tracking user activities related to their system logins.'
