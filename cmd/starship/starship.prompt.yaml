documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `starship prompt` is not a standalone Linux command but rather refers to Starship, an open-source, customizable cross-platform terminal prompt application written in Rust. It provides various themes and plugins for customizing the look and functionality of your terminal prompt, including displaying information such as Git branch, directory path, and user information. To use Starship with your terminal, you need to install it, configure it, and set it as your default terminal prompt. This is usually done by modifying your shell configuration file (e.g., .bashrc or .zshrc) to include the appropriate Starship command for loading the config. For more detailed instructions, refer to the official Starship documentation.'
    flag:
        cmd-duration: '[AI] The `--cmd-duration` flag in the Starship Prompt is used to enable or disable the display of command duration information in the prompt. When enabled, the time taken to execute each command is displayed next to it in the prompt. This can be helpful for tracking command execution times and identifying slow commands. The flag can be set by adding `--cmd-duration auto` or `--cmd-duration off/on` to the Starship configuration file.'
        help: '[AI] The `--help` flag is a common command-line option used in various programs and scripts, including those related to Starship, a cross-platform, customizable prompt tool for Unix and Windows shells. When run with the `--help` argument, Starship displays detailed information about its usage, available commands, and options. It''s essential for users who want to learn how to effectively interact with Starship or need a quick reference on specific features and functions.'
        jobs: '[AI] The `--jobs` flag for the Starship Prompt is used to configure the number of parallel jobs that can be run in the background. When this option is set, Starship will display a symbol representing the current number of active jobs in the terminal prompt. By default, it is set to 0, meaning no jobs are displayed. To enable job display and set the maximum number of parallel jobs, use `--job-max N` where N is the desired limit. For instance, `--jobs 3` will show up to three active jobs in the prompt.'
        keymap: '[AI] The `--keymap` flag in the Starship Prompt, a modern and customizable terminal prompt for Unix-based systems, is used to specify a custom keymap file. A keymap defines key bindings that allow users to map keys or key combinations to various actions or commands within the terminal. By providing a custom keymap file with the `--keymap` flag during initialization, users can personalize their terminal experience and create efficient shortcuts for frequently used tasks.'
        path: '[AI] The `--path` flag for the Starship Prompt, a popular terminal prompt for various Unix-based systems, is used to specify the directory path that will be displayed in the prompt. It takes one or more arguments representing the directories whose paths should be shown in the prompt. For example, `--path=''$HOME/$Project''` would display the current project directory under the user''s home directory in the prompt. When this flag is not provided or an empty value is given, the default behavior is to show only the current working directory.'
        status: '[AI] The `--status` flag is a command used with Starship, an open-source, cross-platform terminal prompt and UI. It''s designed to display current status information, such as the Git branch or repository being worked on, the user''s current directory, or any custom segments, like battery level for laptops or Wi-Fi signal strength. The flag is typically used with other Starship commands, like `starship config --status on`, enabling the status output in your terminal prompt.'
        version: '[AI] The `--version` flag is a command-line argument used with the Starship prompt, a popular terminal prompt replacement for PowerShell and zsh. This flag requests the current version of Starship to be displayed in the terminal prompt. When executed, it returns the version number as output, helping users verify they''re using the latest or desired version of the application.'
