documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git merge-index` is a low-level Git command used to manually merge changes from two trees into a common index. It doesn''t create a new commit or update the working directory but only prepares the index for a potential commit. This command can be useful in certain edge cases, like resolving merge conflicts manually before creating a commit.'
