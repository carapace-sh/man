documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `brew release` command is used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to publish a new version of an already installed Homebrew tap (repository). This command creates and pushes a new tag with the given version number to the repository on GitHub, along with a corresponding commit message. It then updates Homebrew''s formulae and taps files in the system, allowing other users to install or upgrade packages using the newly published version.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `brew release --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command triggers the release process with additional debugging information. When run, it will build and bottle debug versions of all formulae (Homebrew''s recipe files) that have been modified since the last release. The output provides detailed logs to help diagnose any issues during the release process.'
        help: '[AI] `brew release --help` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux. This command displays detailed help information about the `release` sub-command of Homebrew. The `release` command is responsible for managing Homebrew''s stable releases. The help output includes a brief description of what the command does, followed by a list of available options and their meanings.

        major: '[AI] `brew release --major` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command triggers the process of releasing a new major version update for Homebrew itself. It''s typically invoked by Homebrew maintainers to update the core formulae and dependencies to the latest versions, ensuring compatibility with newer operating systems or libraries. The release will be available to users via an automatic upgrade once it has been pushed to the Homebrew repository.'
        minor: '[AI] `brew release --minor` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command triggers the installation of updates for all formulae with a minor version change in their Homebrew tap. It means that only formulae with a patch release will be updated, while major releases are skipped. The goal is to provide stable updates and minimize potential disruptions caused by major changes.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `brew release --quiet` command is used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to fetch and install the latest stable releases of Homebrew and its formulae without displaying any verbose output or progress bars. This is useful when running automated scripts or background processes where you want to suppress the visual feedback.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew release --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command triggers a new release cycle by preparing and publishing new bottle formulas for software packages. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output displayed during the process, providing more detailed information about each step taken.'
