    command: '[AI] The `faas-cli store` command is used in Faas-Netes, a FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) platform, to manage the storage of functions and applications. It allows you to add, remove, or list functions that are stored in a registry for deployment using Faas-Netes. By storing functions, you can easily manage and version them across different environments without having to redeploy the code each time. The command takes various options such as `add`, `rm`, and `ls` to perform specific actions on function storage.'
