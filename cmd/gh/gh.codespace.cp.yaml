documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh codespace cp` is a GitHub CLI (gh) command used to copy files or directories within a GitHub Codespace. It requires an active codespace session and takes the source and destination paths as arguments, e.g., `gh codespace cp path/to/source path/to/destination`. This command allows developers to modify their codespaces in real-time without having to push changes to the repository first.'
    flag:
        expand: '[AI] `gh codespace cp --expand` is a command used in GitHub''s Codespaces, which is a cloud-based development environment provided by GitHub. This command copies files and directories between your local machine and the Codespace. The `--expand` flag expands compressed files or archives in the source path before copying them to the Codespace. This can be useful when dealing with large projects or dependencies that are distributed as archives.'
        profile: '[AI] The command `gh codespace create --profile` is used in GitHub''s GitHubActions or GitHub CLI to create a new GitHub CodeSpace, which is a pre-configured development environment for your project. The `--profile` flag specifies the name of an existing GitHub profile that defines the operating system, runtime, and other settings for the CodeSpace. For example, you might have profiles set up for different languages or frameworks, allowing you to easily create consistent environments for your projects.'
        recursive: '[AI] `gh codespace cp` is a command provided by GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, `gh`. This command creates or updates a GitHub CodeSpace, which is an isolated and ephemeral environment for building, testing, and deploying your code. The `--recursive` flag ensures that the operation is performed on all the directories and files in the current repository recursively. In summary, `gh codespace cp --recursive` creates or updates a GitHub CodeSpace using the current repository and performs the operation recursively on all files and directories within it.'
