    command: '[AI] The `toit lsp repro serve` command is a part of Toit, an object-oriented programming language. This specific command sets up an LSP (Language Server Protocol) repository and starts serving it. The Language Server Protocol enables modern code editors to have advanced features like autocomplete, error checking, and code navigation. So, this command is used to run a Toit Language Server that can be integrated with popular IDEs or text editors for a better development experience.'
