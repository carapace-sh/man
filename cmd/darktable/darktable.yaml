documentation:
    command: '[AI] Darktable is a popular open-source photo editing software, designed as an alternative to Adobe Lightroom and other commercial RAW processors. It provides a comprehensive workflow for developing digital photographs, featuring advanced tools for color correction, tone adjustment, and lens corrections, among others. The user interface is based on a modular design, allowing users to customize the development process according to their preferences. Darktable supports various file formats including RAW and JPEG, and it is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems.'
    flag:
        cachedir: '[AI] `darktable --cachedir` is a command-line option used in the image processing software Darktable. It sets or queries the cache directory, which is a local storage location for temporary files that are used to speed up image processing tasks by storing frequently accessed data closer to the application. By default, Darktable uses the system''s cache directory. However, specifying a custom cache directory with `--cachedir` can improve performance, especially when working with large images or complex workflows. For instance, `darktable --cachedir /path/to/custom/cache` sets the cache directory to the specified path.'
        conf: '[AI] `darktable --conf` is a command-line option for the image processing software Darktable. It is used to display and modify the application''s configuration file, typically named ".dtprefs" in the user''s home directory. This option does not open the graphical user interface but instead outputs the current configuration settings to the terminal or a text editor that the user specifies, allowing for fine-grained customization of Darktable.'
        configdir: '[AI] `darktable --configdir` is a command-line option for the image processing software, Darktable. It specifies the directory where Darktable should look for or save its configuration files. These files store user preferences and settings. By using this option, users can choose to keep their custom configurations in a specific folder instead of the default location.'
        d: '[AI] The `-d` flag in Darktable, an open-source photography workflow application and raw developer, is used to specify the output directory for exported images. When using this option, users should provide the desired export directory as an argument. For instance, `darktable -d /path/to/export/directory/` will export processed images to the given location.'
        datadir: '[AI] The `--datadir` option in the darktable image processing software sets the directory where user-installed data, such as presets, styles, and custom configurations, are stored. It is typically used when installing darktable from a distribution package manager to specify an alternative location for data files other than the default system-wide location. For example, `--datadir /usr/local/share` or `--datadir ~/.config/darktable`.'
        disable-opencl: '[AI] The command `darktable --disable-OPENCL` is used to launch the image processing software Darktable with the OpenCL (Open Computing Language) functionality disabled. OpenCL is a parallel computing framework for GPUs and other processors, which can significantly speed up certain image processing tasks in Darktable. However, if OpenCL is not supported on your system or if you prefer to use the CPU for processing, you can disable it by adding this flag when invoking Darktable from the command line.'
        help: '[AI] `darktable --help` is a command used in DarkTable, an open-source photography workflow application and RAW developer. The command displays comprehensive help information about DarkTable itself and its various options and features. The output includes details on how to use the software effectively, including information on installation, usage, and advanced functions. It''s essentially a quick reference guide for users to get started with or optimize their experience in DarkTable.'
        library: '[AI] The `--library` command-line option in Darktable is used to specify a custom directory for storing and managing the photo metadata and processing modules (also known as recipes). This flag allows users to create and use their own custom collections, ratings, tags, and presets that are not part of the default installation. It enhances the organizational capabilities of the software and enables a more personalized workflow.'
        localedir: '[AI] `darktable --localedir` is a command-line option for the photo editing software, Darktable. It specifies the directory where Darktable should look for locale files, such as translation files for user interfaces and date/time format settings, to customize the application''s language or regional preferences. Using this option allows users to use or provide their own localized data instead of relying on the default settings.'
        luacmd: '[AI] `darktable --luacmd` is a command-line option for the image processing software Darktable. It allows users to pass Lua scripts as arguments and execute them directly within Darktable. This can be useful for advanced image processing tasks, automating repetitive workflows, or creating custom development recipes. The scripts are executed in the Luajit environment provided by Darktable.'
        moduledir: '[AI] `darktable --moduledir` is a command-line option used in Darktable, an open-source photography workflow application. This option sets the directory where Darktable will look for additional modules, which are plugins that extend the functionality of the software. By providing a specific directory as an argument, users can add new modules to Darktable without installing them system-wide or using third-party repositories. For example: `darktable --moduledir=/path/to/module/directory`.'
        noiseprofiles: '[AI] The `--noiseprofiles` option in the darktable image processing software disables the use of noise profiles during development. Noise profiles are used to reduce digital sensor noise from images, particularly in long exposures or high ISO settings. By disabling this feature, users may choose to rely solely on other tools within darktable for noise reduction or no processing at all. This option can be useful when working with images that have minimal noise or when the desired aesthetic includes visible grain or noise.'
        t: '[AI] `darktable -t` is a command-line option used with the photo editing software, Darktable. The `-t` (or `--test`) option is used to run Darktable in test mode. In this mode, Darktable does not save any changes to files, making it ideal for testing configurations or scripts without affecting original images.'
        tmpdir: '[AI] The `--tmpdir` option in Darktable, an open-source photography workflow application and RAW developer, specifies the directory where temporary files should be stored during image processing. By default, Darktable uses a system-defined location for temporary files, but setting this option allows users to choose a custom directory if desired, which can be useful for managing large amounts of data or working within specific file organizational structures.'
        version: '[AI] `darktable --version` is a command used in the terminal or console interface to check the version information of the Darktable photo development application. When executed, it will display output showing the specific version number, build date, and other relevant information such as the compilation flags and operating system. This command helps users ensure they are running the latest version, troubleshoot issues, or identify compatibility with other software.'
