    command: '[AI] The `gh codespace code` command is used in GitHub''s Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, `gh`, to create or checkout a new codespace - an isolated development environment for working on a repository. This specific command checks out the latest code from the branch or commit specified in your local repository and sets it up in the codespace. The changes made in the codespace are synced with the main branch in real-time, enabling collaboration and ensuring that everyone is working on the most updated codebase.'
    flag:
        insiders: |-
            [AI] The `gh codespace code --insiders` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create or check in to an Insiders codespace in GitHub.

            Insiders codespaces are GitHub's managed development environments for testing and experimenting with new features before they are released publicly. By running this command, you are requesting GitHub to set up a new codespace with the latest insider builds or check in your changes to an existing one. It assumes that you have already authenticated yourself with GitHub and have the necessary permissions for creating or updating codespaces.
        web: '[AI] The `gh codespace code --web` command is used with GitHub''s Codespaces, which provides an isolated development environment in the cloud for working on projects. This specific command creates a new Codespace using a GitHub repository and opens a web-based terminal and editor instance within that environment. It allows users to write, build, test, and debug their code directly in the browser without setting up any local dependencies or infrastructure.'
