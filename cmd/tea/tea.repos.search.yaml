documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea repos search` command is used in the TeaDB database management system to search for repository names that match a given query string. This command sends a request to the TeaDB server to perform a repository name search and returns a list of matching repository names. It''s an essential tool for users looking to manage multiple repositories and quickly locate specific ones within their TeaDB environment.'
    flag:
        archived: '[AI] `tea repos search --archived` is a command used in the Git Tea CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. This command searches for repositories that are archived, meaning they have been marked as no longer in active use but still available for potential future reference. The results will be displayed based on the name or description of the repository.'
        fields: '[AI] `tea repos search --fields` is a command used in the Git tool `tannin` (also known as `tea-cli`), which allows users to perform advanced searches across their Git repositories. The `--fields` option specifies which fields should be included in the search results. For example, `--fields name,default_branch` would return the repository names and their default branches during the search.'
        limit: '[AI] The `tea repos search --limit` command is a part of the `tea-cli` tool in GitLab. It is used to search for specific repositories within an entire GitLab instance or a group, and returns up to a specified number of results with the `--limit` option. This can help users quickly find the repository they are looking for without having to manually browse through all available repositories.'
        login: '[AI] The command `tea repos search --login` is a function in the Tectonic (now OpenEBS) tool Tea, used for managing containers and volumes in Kubernetes clusters. This specific command searches for repositories in OpenEBS registry with the given login name. In other words, it helps you find and manage the OpenEBS repositories owned by a particular user or team.'
        output: '[AI] The `--output` flag in the `tea repos search` command is used to specify the output format when searching for repositories using the Tea CLI tool. It allows users to customize how the search results are displayed, such as in JSON format, table format, or human-readable format. For example, `tea repos search --query "go" --output json` would return the search results in a JSON format that could be easily parsed and processed by other scripts or tools.'
        owner: '[AI] The `--owner` option in the Git command `git teapros search` is used to filter the search results based on the specified GitHub username or email address of a commit author or repository owner. It helps users quickly find repositories or commits belonging to a specific GitHub user.'
        page: |-
            [AI] The `tea repos search --page` command is a part of the `tea-cli`, which is a command-line interface tool for GitHub's REST API, called "The Elephant Aquarium." This command is used to search for repositories on GitHub.

            The `--page` option specifies the page number of the search results to retrieve. By default, it shows only up to 30 results per page. To view subsequent pages, provide the appropriate page number using this option. For example, `tea repos search --q keyword --page 2` would return the second page of search results for the given query term "keyword."
        private: '[AI] `tea repos search --private` is a command used in the Git tool `tea`, which is a CLI for managing Git repositories with a focus on security and privacy. This specific command searches for private Git repositories within an organization or user''s account. The ''--private'' flag filters the search results to only show private repositories that are not publicly accessible.'
        topic: '[AI] The `--topic` argument in the `tea repos search` command is used to filter GitHub repository searches based on specific topics or categories. With this option, you can limit your search results to repositories that have been tagged with certain topics. For example, if you use `--topic golang`, the search will return only repositories labeled with the "golang" topic. This helps to refine and narrow down large repository search results to more relevant and specific ones for your needs.'
        type: '[AI] The `tea repos search --type` command is used in the Git version control system with the Tectonic (TGI) Git Operations (Tea) tool. This command searches for repositories that match a given filter, specifically looking for those that are of a certain type. The `--type` option specifies the repository type to search for, such as `branch`, `tag`, or `remote`. It returns a list of matching repositories with their respective names and types.'
