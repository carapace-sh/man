            [AI] The `newrelic nerdstorage collection delete` command is used to delete specific collections of data stored in New Relic's NerdGraph Data Store, also known as NerdStorage. The `--scope` option specifies the level at which the deletion will be applied:

            * `application:` Deletes the collection for a specific application.
            * `account:` Deletes the collection across all applications within an account.

            For example, `newrelic nerdstorage collection delete --scope application my_app_name` would delete the specified collection only for the application named "my\_app\_name", while `newrelic nerdstorage collection delete --scope account my_account_id` would delete the specified collection across all applications in the account with the given ID.
