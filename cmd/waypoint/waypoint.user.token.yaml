documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint user token` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source fleet management solution by Hashicorp, to display or manage the API tokens associated with a specific user account. These tokens can be used to authenticate and interact programmatically with the Waypoint server. To obtain or show the token, run `waypoint user token [username] list` or `waypoint user token [username] show`, respectively. Replace `[username]` with the desired username.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `--app` flag with the "waypoint user token" command is used in Waypoint, an open-source application delivery platform by Docker. It specifies the name or the container image of the target application to which a new user token will be generated and applied. This command helps secure access to applications deployed with Waypoint by creating unique tokens for each user, granting them fine-grained permissions based on their roles.'
        expires-in: '[AI] The `--expires-in` option in the `waypoint user token` command is used to specify the duration for which the newly generated user access token should be valid. It takes a time duration argument, such as "1h" for one hour or "2d" for two days. This option ensures that the token has an expiration date set, adding an extra layer of security to your Waypoint deployment.'
        plain: '[AI] The command `flag "waypoint user token" --plain` is used in Waypoint, an open-source platform for managing and securing application configurations. This flag is used to output the user token in plain text format without encryption. Waypoint supports storing sensitive data like tokens encrypted at rest and decrypts them on demand with proper authorization. Using this flag disables encryption for the specified user token.'
        project: |-
            [AI] The `--flag waypoint user-token --project` is used in the context of using Google Cloud's `gcloud` command-line tool with the `waypoint` package for managing Kubernetes resources.

            The `user-token` is an authentication token representing the identity and permissions of a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project member or service account. By providing this flag along with the `--project` flag, which specifies the ID of the GCP project, the `gcloud` tool will use this token for authenticating and authorizing requests to interact with the specified project's resources.

            This setup is useful when automating tasks or scripts that require access to a specific set of resources in a given Google Cloud Platform project without having to manually authenticate each time.
        username: '[AI] The `--username` option under the `waypoint user` command in Terraform''s Waypoint CLI is used to specify the username of an Authenticator or OIDC provider for authentication and authorization purposes when interacting with a remote Terraform Cloud or Atlas account. The `--token` flag is optional and should be followed by the API token provided by the Authenticator or OIDC provider. Together, these flags allow secure access to manage infrastructure as code using Waypoint.'
        workspace: |-
            [AI] The `flag "waypoint user-token --workspace"` is used with Waypoint, an open-source tool for managing Kubernetes applications. This specific flag is responsible for specifying a user token associated with a particular workspace in Waypoint's configuration.

            The workspace is essentially a logical grouping of related applications and infrastructure configurations managed by Waypoint. The user token represents the authentication credentials for interacting with a target environment, such as a Kubernetes cluster. By providing this flag, you ensure that Waypoint uses the correct set of credentials when managing resources within the specified workspace.
