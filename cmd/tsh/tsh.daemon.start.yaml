documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tsh daemon start` command is used in the Tenable Security Center platform to start the Tenable Security Hardening Assessment (SHAS) daemon. This background process enables the SHAS service, which performs security configuration assessments and reporting for Tenable products such as Nessus and Scan-as-a-Service (SaaS). The command initiates the daemon to run automatically upon system startup, ensuring continuous assessment of your system''s security posture.'
    flag:
        addr: '[AI] The command `tsh daemon start --addr` is used to start the Torrent Software House''s (TSH) BitTorrent daemon in the background mode with the specified IP address or interface for binding. Here, `tsh` refers to the TSH BitTorrent client software and `daemon` signifies running it as a background process. The option `--addr <IP_address>` sets the address for the daemon to listen on for incoming connections.'
        certs-dir: '[AI] The `tsh` (Telnet Server Hub) command `start --certs-dir` is used to start the TSH daemon with a specified directory containing SSL certificates. These certificates are required for secure communication between clients and the TSH server using encrypted connections. The `--certs-dir` option indicates the location of the certificate files, which are then loaded by the TSH daemon during startup to enable secured communication.'
        prehog-addr: '[AI] The command `tsh daemon start --prehog-addr <IP_ADDRESS>` is used to start the Tenable Security Hardening (Tsh) daemon in prehost mode with the specified IP address as its listening address. In prehost mode, the Tsh daemon functions as a standalone agent that does not require a central Tenable Security Center or Logrhythm server to operate. The `--prehog-addr` option sets the IP address and port number that other hosts can use to connect to this Tsh agent for remote configuration and data collection.'
