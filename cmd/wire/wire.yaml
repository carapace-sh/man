documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `wire` command in FPGA design, specifically within Xilinx Vivado and Verilog or VHDL code, is used for constraint-based routing and placement. It sets up interconnects between pins or nets of various intellectual property (IP) cores or user-defined logic blocks in the floorplan stage of FPGA design flow. By specifying routing resources and constraints like distance, direction, or layers, this command optimizes the signal path for improved performance and reduced power consumption.'
