description: wait for device to be in given state
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `adb wait-for-sideload` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to pause the execution of a script until an Android device enters sideload mode, also known as USB debugging with OEM unlocking enabled. Sideload mode allows installation of apps from outside Google Play Store, which is useful for installing custom ROMs or apps not available in the store. The command does not itself perform any action but signals ADB scripts to wait until this specific device state is met before continuing with further instructions.'
