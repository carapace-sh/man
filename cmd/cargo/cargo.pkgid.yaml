    command: '[AI] `cargo pkgid` is a command used in Rust programming language''s package manager, Cargo. This command returns the identifier (ID) of the current crate, which consists of its name and version number, in the format `name-version`. It''s often used when interacting with registries or repositories to ensure that you are using the correct version of a dependency.'

            [AI] The `cargo pkgid` command is a sub-command used in Cargo, Rust's package manager. It's primarily used to print the Package Identifier (PID or pkg-id) of a given Rust project.

            The `--help` flag provides information on how to use this command effectively. When you run `cargo pkgid --help`, Cargo displays a message that explains:

            1. The purpose of the `pkgid` subcommand, which is to print the package identifier for the current project or given path.
            2. Optional arguments like `--manifest-path` to specify a different manifest file instead of the default one.
            3. Explanation of the output format. By default, it prints just the PID, but you can change the output to also include other details using `--verbose` or `--json`.
            4. Information on how to use the command in scripts with the `--no-interactive` flag for quieter operation.
        manifest-path: '[AI] The `cargo pkgid` command is a utility provided by Rust''s package manager, Cargo. When invoked with the options `--manifest-path`, it returns the unique identifier (ID) of the Rust project whose manifest file is located at the specified path. This ID, also known as Package Identifier or PIDGID, is a string used to identify the package within the Crate Index system, allowing precise and automated dependency management.'
        package: '[AI] The `cargo pkgid` command is a sub-command of Cargo, Rust''s package manager. When used with the `--package` option, it returns the unique identifier (ID) of the specified Rust package in the crates.io registry. This ID is a string that uniquely identifies the package by combining its namespace and name, for example: `username_package_name`. It''s useful when working with dependency management or automation tasks in Cargo projects.'
        quiet: '[AI] `cargo pkgid` is a command used in Rust programming language''s package manager, Cargo. The `--quiet` flag is an optional argument that instructs Cargo to run with minimal output or "quiet mode." When using this flag, Cargo will only print the unique ID (pkg-id) of the specified package without displaying any other messages or progress bars. For example, `cargo pkgid --quiet my_project` would return just the pkg-id for "my\_project" without any additional output.'
