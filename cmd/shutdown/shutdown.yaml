    --no-wall: Don't send wall message before halt/power-off/reboot
    -H, --halt: Halt the machine
    -P, --poweroff: Power-off the machine
    -c: Cancel a pending shutdown
    -h: Equivalent to --poweroff, overridden by --halt

    -r, --reboot: Reboot the machine
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `shutdown` command is used to gracefully stop or reboot a computer system, providing time for applications and processes to save data before the system shuts down completely. It takes various options such as specifying a time for the shutdown or restart to occur, or forcing an immediate shutdown without saving data. For example, `shutdown /s` initiates an immediate system shutdown, while `shutdown /r` performs a system reboot. The command typically requires administrative privileges to execute.'
    flag:
        c: '[AI] The `shutdown` command with the `-c` option is used to cancel a previously issued system shutdown or reboot command on Unix-based systems. It does not cause an immediate shutdown or restart, but instead cancels any pending shutdown or reboot command that was scheduled for later. This option allows administrators to change their mind about the planned system downtime if necessary.'
        h: '[AI] The command `shutdown -h` is used to perform a graceful system shutdown or halt in Unix-like operating systems. The `-h` option stands for "halt," indicating that the system will be fully powered off after the shutdown process completes. This command sends a signal to all running processes, asking them to save their data and exit cleanly before the system shuts down. It also sends a warning message to all logged-in users, giving them a chance to save their work before the shutdown occurs.'
        halt: '[AI] The `shutdown` command with the `--halt` option is used to initiate an orderly halt of a Linux system. This means that all running processes will be gracefully terminated, and the system will be brought down to a complete stop. During the halt process, important data is saved and the file system is synchronized to ensure data integrity. The power is then cut off or the system is otherwise physically shut down. It''s an essential tool for performing system maintenance tasks or in response to certain emergencies.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `shutdown` is a Linux command used to perform system shutdown or reboot. The `--help` option displays detailed usage information when run with this command. Here's what you can expect:

            1. System Shutdown: Displays options for performing a graceful (synchronous) or forceful (asynchronous) shutdown of the system, including various timeout values.
            2. Reboot: Provides options to reboot the system instead of shutting it down.
            3. Power Options: Lists available power management actions like suspend to disk (hibernate), standby, and hybrid-sleep.
            4. Runtime and Wallclock Time: Describes how to specify a specific runtime or wallclock time for the shutdown or reboot command.
            5. Interactive Mode: Explains how to use an interactive mode for shutting down individual processes before system shutdown.
            6. Signals: Lists available signals that can be used to send specific messages and requests to running processes during a shutdown or reboot.
            7. System Queries: Provides options to check system status, such as if the system is currently running or not.
            8. Exit Codes and Error Handling: Describes what exit codes are returned for various conditions and how errors are handled.
            9. Examples: Offers some common usage examples of the shutdown command.
        k: '[AI] The `shutdown` command with the `-k` option is used to send a test shutdown or reboot signal to the Linux kernel without actually executing the shutdown or reboot process. This can be useful for testing scripts or procedures that will be run during a real shutdown or reboot, or for practicing emergency shutdown procedures. When `shutdown -k` is issued, a warning message is displayed, and the system logs an entry indicating that a shutdown or reboot has been scheduled. No actual system shutdown occurs.'
        no-wall: '[AI] The `shutdown` command with the option `--no-wall` is used to perform a graceful shutdown of a Linux system without sending a wall message (a message that is displayed on all terminals) to the users before the shutdown process starts. This can be useful in situations where you want to avoid interrupting the users with a message, such as when planning a scheduled shutdown or performing an administrative task that does not require user interaction during the shutdown process.'
        poweroff: '[AI] The `shutdown` command with the `--poweroff` option is used to perform an immediate system shutdown followed by a power off action. This means that the operating system will be gracefully shut down, then all power will be cut off to the computer or server. This can be done remotely or locally and is often used for maintenance tasks or when it''s necessary to completely turn off a machine. It''s important to note that unsaved data may be lost during an unexpected power loss.'
        reboot: '[AI] The `shutdown` command with the `--reboot` option is used to shut down and then immediately reboot a Linux system. This can be issued from the terminal or command line interface. It first performs an orderly shutdown of the system, stopping all running processes in an organized manner, saving open files, and closing open applications. Once the shutdown process is complete, the system will automatically restart, loading a new boot image and starting up the system again. This can be useful for applying updates, installing new software, or troubleshooting issues on Linux systems.'
