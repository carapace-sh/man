documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule list` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration, to display a list of current binding rules set up under the Access Control List (ACL) policy. Binding rules define how ACL policies are applied to services, queries, and other resources within a Consul cluster. By running this command, you can view the ID, name, source, destination, and other relevant details of each binding rule in your Consul setup.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule list --ca-file` command is used in Consul, an open-source multi-purpose solution for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command lists the Access Control List (ACL) binding rules under a specific ACL policy file specified by the `--ca-file` flag. A binding rule defines how a particular token can access a resource in Consul. The output will include details such as the token ID, the type of resource being accessed, and the permitted actions on that resource.'
        ca-path: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule list --ca-path` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command lists the Access Control List (ACL) binding rules under the specified Certificate Authority (CA) path. The CA path is a directory containing one or more PEM-encoded Certificate Authority certificates that are used to authenticate and authorize requests in Consul''s ACL system. By specifying the `--ca-path` option, the command filters the output to show only the binding rules associated with the specified CA. This helps in managing and securing access control in complex environments where multiple Certificate Authorities are used.'
        client-cert: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule list --client-cert` command is used with the Consul Access Control List (ACL) feature in the Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. This command lists the binding rules for a specific client certificate. Binding rules define which resources a client is allowed to access based on ACL policies. By providing the `--client-cert` flag, the command filters the output to only show the binding rules associated with the specified client certificate.'
        client-key: '[AI] `consul acl binding-rule list --client-key` is a command used with Consul''s Access Control List (ACL) feature. This command lists all the binding rules associated with a specific client key in Consul. A binding rule determines which policies grant access to which resources within Consul''s service, key or node registry. The `--client-key` flag filters the output to only show the binding rules associated with the provided client key.'
        datacenter: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule list --datacenter` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. It retrieves the ACL (Access Control List) binding rules of a specific datacenter in Consul''s access control system. ACL binding rules define the permissions for different policies that can be applied to resources in Consul, such as services, keys, and other data. The output of this command displays a list of the binding rules, including their names, actions (permit or deny), and the associated policies and selectors. It helps administrators to manage access control at a granular level in their Consul environment.'
        format: '[AI] `consul acl binding-rule list --format` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery and configuration management. This specific command lists all the ACL (Access Control List) binding rules that have been defined within Consul. The `--format` flag determines the output format, typically used to customize how the data is displayed. In this case, it''s asking for a human-readable format.'
        http-addr: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule list --http-addr` command is used with the Consul Access Control List (ACL) feature to retrieve information about ACL binding rules from a Consul server. The `--http-addr` option specifies the HTTP address of the Consul server. This command returns a JSON formatted output that includes details such as ID, name, policies, and other metadata for each binding rule in the Consul ACL policy.'
        meta: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule list --meta` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This specific command lists all the binding rules under the Access Control List (ACL) in Consul, and displays their metadata. Metadata refers to key-value pairs that can be attached to ACL resources for additional information. By using this command, you can view details such as creation time, creator ID, and other custom tags associated with each binding rule.'
        method: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule list --method` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command lists the Access Control List (ACL) binding rules with the specified method. ACL rules define access control policies that determine which principals have what permissions on what resources within a Consul datacenter. The `--method` flag filters the output to display only the binding rules of the specified method, such as "token", "certificate", or "x509".'
        namespace: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule list --namespace` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command lists the Access Control List (ACL) binding rules within a specific Kubernetes namespace. ACL binding rules define permissions for Consul resources based on access policies. By specifying a namespace with this command, you can view the binding rules that apply to services, keys, and other resources within that namespace.'
        stale: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule list --stale` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an IT management solution for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command lists all the ACL (Access Control List) binding rules that are stale, meaning they are no longer valid due to changes in the Consul environment. The `--stale` flag filters the output to only show these outdated binding rules, helping administrators maintain up-to-date access control configurations in their Consul setup.'
        tls-server-name: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule list --tls-server-name` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source distributed configuration and service management tool. This command lists the Access Control List (ACL) binding rules that use TLS server names for secure communication between services.

            Binding rules define how ACL policies are enforced on services and their clients. In this case, the `--tls-server-name` option filters the output to only display binding rules that include a specific TLS server name. This can be useful for managing and understanding the security configurations for services that communicate over TLS in Consul.
        token: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule list --token` command is used to retrieve a list of ACL (Access Control List) binding rules in the Consul data center, which is a connectivity and service discovery tool. The `--token` flag specifies the authentication token required for accessing Consul''s API. This command returns detailed information about each binding rule, including its name, ID, type, and other relevant metadata. It helps in managing and securing access to services within the Consul environment.'
        token-file: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule list --token-file` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration, to list all the access control listing rules that are currently bound to a specific ACL token. The `--token-file` option specifies the path to the file containing the token to be used for the operation. This command helps in understanding which resources and actions a particular token has been granted access to within a Consul datacenter.'
