    command: |-
        [AI] `pprof` is a command-line tool in Go programming language for profiling and analyzing Go programs. It provides several subcommands for different types of profiling:

        1. `cpuprofile` generates CPU profiles as call trees or flat profiles in various output formats like `.cpuprof`, `.prof`, and `.csv`.
        2. `memprofile` produces memory profiles, saved in the `.memprofile` format.
        3. `block` analyzes the block profiling data generated by the Go runtime's `-m` flag.
        4. `symbolize` transforms profile data into readable symbols, making it easier to understand where the code is spending time or consuming memory.
        5. It also has a web interface for viewing the results in a browser.

        Using `pprof` helps identify performance bottlenecks and memory issues in Go applications.
    flag:
        add_comment: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go tool used for profiling and identifying performance bottlenecks in Go programs. The `-add_comment` flag is an optional argument when using `pprof` to generate a CallGraph or Profile output. When this flag is set, the generated output will include comments with function names and file paths for each node in the call graph or profile data. These comments help improve the readability of the generated data, making it easier to understand the flow of function calls and identify performance issues.'
        addresses: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool that provides various methods to profile and analyze Go programs. The `-addresses` flag is an option for the `pprof` `profile` command, which generates a call graph or a heap profile with the address information of allocated objects. This flag adds memory addresses to the output, allowing users to understand not only the function call hierarchy but also where in memory each object is located.'
        alloc_objects: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool used to analyze and identify memory issues in Go programs. The `-alloc_objects` flag is one of its reporting modes. It generates a detailed report of allocated objects based on their size, number, and allocation stack traces. This information can help developers understand the memory usage pattern of their code and locate memory leaks or excessive allocations.'
        alloc_space: '[AI] `pprof` is a profiling tool in Go language for generating and analyzing CPU profiles. The `-alloc_space` flag modifies the output of `pprof` to show allocations information, displaying the total and cumulative memory allocated by each function or operation in the call tree. This data helps identify memory usage patterns, leaks, and allocation hotspots.'
        base: '[AI] `pprof` is a profiling tool in Go language. The `-base` option is used with `pprof` to generate a base profile file, which contains the aggregated statistical data about the execution of the Go program. This includes information such as the number of times each function or operation was called, the total time spent in each function or operation, and the percentage of total time spent in each one. This file can be used as a reference for further analysis with other `pprof` tools like `pprof -web` or `pprof -text`.'
        buildid: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go tool that provides various profiling features for analyzing and understanding Go programs'' performance. The `-buildid` flag is used to specify a build identifier, which is a string value associated with the binary or source file being profiled. This identifier can be useful in correlating profiling data from multiple runs of the same program built with different configurations or versions. For instance, it could represent the Git commit hash, the Go version, or any other distinguishing value. Using `pprof` with the `-buildid` flag makes it easier to compare and analyze performance data across different builds.'
        call_tree: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool that helps identify performance bottlenecks in Go programs. The `-call_tree` option generates a call graph profile, which is a hierarchical representation of the function calls in the program, showing the number of times each function was called and how often it called other functions. It helps to understand the flow of control between functions and identify deep recursion or excessive function calls, allowing developers to optimize their code for better performance.'
        callgrind: '[AI] `pprof` is a performance profiling tool in Go language. The `-callgrind` flag is used to generate a CallGraph profile, which provides detailed information about the interprocedural call relationships and call trees in your Go program. When you run `pprof` with this flag, it generates a CallGraph file (in the `callgrind.out.*` format) that can be read by tools like KCachegrind or Valgrind''s Callgrinder tool for visualizing and analyzing the call relationships.'
        comments: '[AI] `pprof` is a performance profiling tool in Go language. The `-comments` flag is used when generating profile reports with the `pprof` tool. This flag causes the generated profile data to include line and function comments from the original source code in the generated output, making it easier for developers to understand the context of the profiled code while analyzing the performance issues.'
        compact_labels: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go tool for profiling and analyzing Go programs. The `-compact_labels` flag is an option used when generating call graph profiles with the `pprof` tool. This flag reduces the size of the output by using compact labels, which means that long function names are represented by a shorter, abbreviated version in the profile data. This can be useful for analyzing large codebases or for sharing profiles across different systems where the full long names might not be available.'
        contentions: '[AI] `pprof` is a performance profiling tool in Go language. The `-contentions` flag is used with the `pprof` tool to generate a contention profile. This profile shows which goroutines are most frequently waiting for each synchronized object (mutex, rwmutex, etc.) during a profiling session. By analyzing this information, one can identify potential contention hotspots and concurrent design issues in Go programs.'
        cum: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool. The option `-cum` specifies that the profiling output should be in cumulative format. This means that the profiling results will show the total and cumulative percentage of time each function or operation has taken during the profiling run. It provides a clearer picture of the overall performance impact of each function or operation, making it easier to identify hotspots and potential optimization targets.'
        diff_base: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool that comes with the standard library. The `-diff_base` flag is used when generating CPU or memory profile reports. It specifies that the new profiling data should be compared against an earlier base profile, creating a difference report. This helps to show the changes in performance or memory usage between two different runs of the program.'
        disasm: '[AI] `pprof` is a profiling tool for Go programs. The `-disasm` flag is used with the `pprof` tool to display assembly code disassemblies of the identified hot functions or goroutines in a Go program''s profile data. It helps developers understand the low-level machine instructions that are causing performance issues, allowing for more targeted optimizations.'
        divide_by: '[AI] `pprof` is a profiling tool in Go language. The `-divide_by` option is used to divide the sample count of each function by a specified number when generating call tree profiles. This can help to reduce noise from functions with a large number of samples and make it easier to identify the top heavy functions in the profile. For example, `pprof -divide_by=100` would divide the sample count of each function by 100 before generating the call tree.'
        dot: '[AI] `pprof` is a profiling tool in Go language. The `-dot` flag is used to generate a dot graph profile, which can be visualized using graph theory tools like Graphviz. This type of profile represents the call graph of Go programs, showing the caller-callee relationships between functions. The resulting graph helps identify performance bottlenecks and function interdependencies.'
        drop_negative: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool that helps identify performance bottlenecks in Go programs. The `-drop_negative` flag modifies the output of `pprof` by excluding call durations that are below a certain threshold, typically considered "noise" or insignificant. This can simplify the profile visualization and make it easier to focus on the most impactful performance issues. The exact threshold is configurable and often set based on the context of the profiling.'
        edgefraction: |-
            [AI] `pprof` is a profiling tool in Go language, and the `-edgefraction` flag is an option used to control the edge sampling rate during CPU profiling.

            When using edge sampling, instead of taking full function call stacks at regular intervals, Go's pprof samples functions based on their edge execution time - the duration between entering and returning from a function. By setting the `-edgefraction` flag, developers can specify the desired fraction of CPU time to be allocated for edge sampling. A higher value will result in more detailed edge profile information at the cost of increased overhead. The default value is 0.01 (or 1%).
        eog: |-
            [AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool. The option `-eog` is composed of three sub-options:

            1. `-e`: It enables recording and printing stack traces for the entire goroutine tree at each sampling point, including the main goroutine. By default, only the current goroutine's stack trace is printed.
            2. `-o`: It specifies an output file where the profiling data will be saved. In this case, it is not explicitly provided in your command.
            3. `-g`: It enables showing the goroutine IDs in the stack traces and the sampling profile. This helps to distinguish between different goroutines during analysis.
        evince: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool. The command `pprof -evince <profile-file>` reads a CPU profile saved in a `.prof` file (created by the `pprof` writing flag like `-cpgp`) and displays an interactive visualization of the call graph and function profiles in a web browser using the `gorgonia/evince` library. The flag `-evince` is used to enable this feature.'
        filefunctions: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool, and the `-filefunctions` flag is used when analyzing CPU profiles generated by the `pprof` tool. This flag instructs `pprof` to output the function call stack information for each sampled or blocked point in the profile data, along with the total time spent in each function. The output is typically written to a file in the Go source code format (`.go`) or plain text format (`.txt`), which can then be visualized using various tools such as the `ggplot2` package for Go or the built-in `perftools.org/cpu` web interface. This information helps developers understand where their code is spending the most time, enabling them to optimize and improve performance.'
        files: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go tool for profiling and analyzing Go programs. The `-files` flag is used with the `pprof` tool to generate profile data in call graph or flat format for multiple Go files instead of a single one. When you run `pprof` with `-files`, it reads profile data from the specified .pprof files, which can be generated by other profiling tools like `go test -bench` or `cpuprofile`, and generates call graph or flat profile output for each file, saving them as separate .pprof files or standard output. This allows for more fine-grained analysis of the performance of individual components in a larger Go codebase.'
        flat: |-
            [AI] The `pprof` tool in Go programming language provides profiling information about the execution of Go programs. The `-flat` flag is an option for `pprof`, which generates a flat profile instead of the stack or call graph profile by default.

            A flat profile summarizes the number of times each function is called during the profiling period. It does not show the call stack context or dependencies between functions, focusing only on the function invocation frequency. This information can be useful for identifying frequently used functions and potential performance bottlenecks without getting lost in the details of the call graph.
        focus: '[AI] The `pprof` flag `-focus` is used in Go programming language profiling to identify the goroutine or function that is consuming the most CPU resources. When this flag is set, the profiler output will highlight the identified goroutine or function, providing a quick way to locate and address performance bottlenecks in your code.'
        functions: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool that provides various methods to analyze and understand the performance of Go programs. The `-functions` flag is used with `pprof` to generate a call graph profile. It shows the functions called by other functions in the order of their invocation, allowing developers to identify bottlenecks and optimize their codebase. This information can be further visualized using external tools such as Graphviz or Chronograf.'
        gif: '[AI] `pprof` is a performance profiling tool in Go language. The `-gif` flag is used to generate a animated gif from the produced pprof charts, which visually represents the call graph or profile data over time. This can be helpful for identifying and understanding long-running functions or hotspots in your Go program.'
        gv: '[AI] `pprof` is a performance profiling tool in Go language. The `-gv` flag is used with `pprof` to generate and visualize call graph profiles. This flag combines two options: `-g` for generating the call graph, and `-v` for enabling verbose output. With this flag, you can get a detailed view of the inter-procedural dependencies and invocation counts within your Go program. The generated profile data can be later visualized using tools such as the `pprof` chart tool or other third-party visualization tools.'
        hide: '[AI] The `pprof` command in Go programming language is used for profiling and analyzing the performance of Go programs. The `-hide` flag is an option that can be passed to `pprof` to exclude specific functions or packages from being displayed in the generated profile reports. This can be useful when dealing with large codebases or focusing on specific parts of the program. When using the `-hide` flag, it takes a list of functions or packages as an argument, and they will be excluded from the profiling results. For example, `pprof -profile -o output.prof --hide=main.MyFunction package1/...` would exclude `MyFunction` in the `main.go` file and all functions in the `package1` package from the generated profile report.'
        http: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool that helps identify and analyze performance issues in Go programs. The `-http` flag is used to enable an HTTP server, which serves the profiling data produced by `pprof`. By starting the program with this flag, `pprof` listens on a specified port for incoming HTTP requests, where clients can retrieve and view the profiling information using popular web browsers or other tools like Graphite or InfluxDB. This makes it easier to share and analyze performance data across teams and environments.'
        ignore: '[AI] `pprof` is a profiling tool in Go language for producing and analyzing CPU profiles. The `-ignore` flag is an option used with `pprof` to exclude specific functions or packages from the profiling results. By ignoring certain functions or packages, you can focus on understanding the performance of the remaining parts of your code. This can help you identify bottlenecks more effectively and improve the overall performance of your Go application.'
        intel_syntax: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool that helps identify performance issues in Go programs. The option `-intel_syntax` is used when generating CPU profiles for the Intel compiler or Intel''s `pnprof` tool. With this flag, the output file generated by `pprof` will contain Intel inline assembly syntax instead of the standard Go call graph format. This allows direct integration with the Intel compiler and profiling data analysis tools designed specifically for it.'
        inuse_objects: '[AI] The `pprof` tool with the `-inuse_objects` flag is used for profiling Go programs to identify memory allocation patterns. When this flag is provided, `pprof` generates a report showing which objects are currently in use by the Go runtime''s memory system, along with their sizes and the number of pointers pointing to them. This information helps developers understand memory consumption and potential memory leaks or excessive allocations in their code.'
        inuse_space: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool that comes with the standard library. The `-inuse_space` flag is used to profile and report memory usage in a Go program. When this flag is provided, pprof generates a profile based on the memory allocations and deallocations, showing which parts of the code are using the most memory at runtime. This information can help identify and address memory leaks or excessive memory usage in the Go application.'
        kcachegrind: '[AI] `pprof` is a performance profiling tool in Go language. The `-kcachegrind` flag is used to generate call graph profiles using the KCacheGrind format. This format is compatible with the popular KDE tool, KCacheGrind, which can be used for interactive visualization and analysis of the call graph data. By using this flag, developers can gain insights into their Go applications'' performance by exploring the relationships between functions in the call tree.'
        lines: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go tool for profiling and analyzing Go programs. The `-lines` flag is used with the `pprof` tool to generate a detailed call graph and line profile output. This output shows, for each function in the call tree, the number of times it was called and the percentage of total CPU time spent in that function and its callee functions, along with the corresponding source code lines. This information can be used for identifying performance bottlenecks in a Go program.'
        list: '[AI] `pprof` is a profiling tool in Go language. The command `pprof -list` generates a list of available CPU profiles, saved in the specified or default output file. It does not actually profile any code but instead lists the existing profiles that can be further analyzed using other `pprof` commands like `pprof -text`, `pprof -svg`, etc.'
        mean: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool that helps identify performance bottlenecks in Go programs. The `-mean` flag is an option used with `pprof` to generate a mean profile report. This report displays the average CPU time consumed by each function and its call tree, providing insights into where the most time is being spent on average during program execution.'
        mean_delay: '[AI] The `pprof` tool''s `-mean_delay` flag is used to profile Go programs and report the average duration of each identified function call or method invocation in the call graph. It calculates the mean delay between the start time and end time for each entry in the profiling data, which represents the average time spent in that particular function or method during the profiling session. This information can be useful for identifying bottlenecks and optimizing performance in Go applications.'
        no_browser: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go tool used for profiling and analyzing Go programs. The command `pprof -no_browser` generates profiling reports in various formats, but does not launch a web browser to view the results. Instead, it saves the report files (like `.profile`, `.callgraph`, or `.inflate`) to the current directory or to a specified output file for further analysis using other tools or by manually reading their contents.'
        nodecount: '[AI] The `pprof` tool is a performance profiling tool in Go language. The `-nodecount` flag is an option used with `pprof` to generate a node profile report. This type of report shows the call tree of functions, along with the number of times each function was called and the total time spent in each function. It provides a more succinct view compared to the default call graph output and can help identify hot spots in your code based on the number of calls and CPU time consumed.'
        nodefraction: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool that helps in identifying performance bottlenecks in Go programs. The `-nodefashion` flag is used with the `pprof` tool to generate a profile report focusing on the node (function or operation) contributions to the total CPU time. It excludes functions marked as "noprofile" during compilation and does not consider the call graph in its analysis, providing a more granular view of function-level performance data.'
        noinlines: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool that helps identify performance bottlenecks in Go programs. The `-noinlines` flag is an option used with the `pprof` tool to generate stack traces for the called functions instead of the actual instruction addresses when creating a call graph or CPU profiles. This can make the resulting profile data easier to read and understand by humans as it presents function names rather than cryptic machine code addresses.'
        normalize: |-
            [AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool that helps identify and analyze performance issues in Go programs. The `-normalize` flag modifies the output of profiling results, specifically the call graph and profile data.

            When used with the `pprof` tool, the `-normalize` flag adjusts the numbers in the call graph and profile data to represent the relative proportions of each function or operation's execution time instead of their absolute times. This makes it easier to compare and understand the distribution of the execution time across different functions or operations within a program.

            In summary, `pprof -normalize` normalizes the profiling results for a clearer understanding of the performance distribution in a Go program.
        output: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go tool for profiling and tracing Go programs. The `-output` flag is used to specify the output format and file name of the generated profile data. It accepts values such as "profile.txt", "cpu.prof", or "trace.out" along with an optional path to save the output file. For example, `pprof -output profile.txt myprogram`.'
        pdf: '[AI] `pprof` is a profiling tool in Go language. The `-pdf` option generates a call graph profile in the form of a dot-graphic format (`.dot`) file, which can be visualized using graph visualization tools like Graphviz. This output provides a deep insight into the inter-function calls and their relationships within the program, helping to identify performance bottlenecks.'
        peek: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool that helps in analyzing and identifying performance issues in Go programs. The command `pprof -peek` is used for real-time profiling, which means it provides instant feedback on the current running Go program''s execution profile without requiring a stop-and-resume or a new build. When you execute this command with the appropriate flags to specify input file (e.g., `myprogram.pb.txt`) and profile type (e.g., CPU), you will see real-time profile data displayed in your terminal, giving an insight into the current function call stack and execution time distribution. This can be useful for identifying hotspots and performance bottlenecks while the program is still running.'
        png: '[AI] `pprof` is a profiling tool in Go language. The command `pprof -png <profile-file>` generates a profile graph as a PNG image from a previously saved profiling data file (`<profile-file>`). This visual representation of the program''s execution helps identify performance bottlenecks and memory issues.'
        proto: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go tool for profile analysis. The `-proto` flag is used with the `pprof` tool''s ` Marccc` or `gperftools` output formats to generate a Chromium Prophet API protocol (protobuf) file instead of a regular text-based profile. This binary format is more compact and efficient for transferring large profile data between different systems, such as from a development machine to a cloud service for further analysis.'
        prune_from: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go tool for profiling and monitoring Go programs. The option `-prune_from` is used to exclude specific packages or functions from being shown in the profiling results. This can help focus on the parts of the code that are consuming the most resources, and ignore those that are not relevant to the current analysis. The flag takes one or more arguments specifying the names of the packages or functions to be excluded.'
        ps: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool. The `-ps` option stands for "profile and print stack." It generates a profiling report in the Go stat sample profile format, which provides a detailed breakdown of the CPU usage of each function or operation in your Go program, sorted by the total amount of time spent on each one. This can help identify performance bottlenecks and memory hotspots in your code. The output also includes other useful information such as the number of times each function was called, the self-time (the time spent in that function itself), and the inherited-time (the time spent in callee functions).'
        raw: '[AI] `pprof` is a profiling tool in Go language. The `-raw` flag is used with `pprof` to generate raw profile data instead of popular formats like callgraph or flamegraph. This output contains detailed CPU profile information, including stack traces and function durations, which can be post-processed using other tools or parsed programmatically for further analysis.'
        relative_percentages: '[AI] `pprof` is a Go profiling tool. The option `-relative_percentages` is used when generating the profile results in the call graph format (`-type=callgraph`). It modifies how the percentage values are displayed for each node in the call graph. Instead of showing absolute numbers, it displays the relative percentages of each node''s total time respecting its parent node. This helps to understand the distribution of the execution time among the called functions and their relationship with their callers.'
        sample_index: '[AI] The `pprof` tool in Go language provides profiling functionality. The `-sample_index` flag is used to specify an index value when working with sampling profiles. This flag determines which sample, among the captured ones, should be further analyzed or printed out. Lower index values correspond to earlier samples during the profiled program execution.'
        seconds: '[AI] The `pprof` command with the `-seconds` flag is used in Go programming language for profiling and identifying performance bottlenecks. This flag sets the duration for which the profiler should run and collect samples, in seconds. After the specified time elapses, the profiler generates a call graph and profile data which can be further analyzed using tools like `pprof` or `goroutine` to identify CPU usage patterns and find areas of code that require optimization.'
        show: '[AI] `pprof -show` is a command from the Go programming language''s profiling tool (pprof). It takes a profile file generated by other pprof commands (like `go test -bench -cpuprofile`) as an argument and prints out detailed statistics about the identified CPU profiles in a human-readable format. This includes call tree, top functions, and stack traces. The information is sorted by the percentage of total CPU time used by each function or operation, helping developers understand performance bottlenecks in their code.'
