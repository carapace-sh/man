description: Renew all available certificates
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save the certificates
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubeconfig=: The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster. If the flag is not set, a set of standard locations can be searched for an existing kubeconfig file.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew all` is a command used to renew or recreate all the TLS certificates managed by Kubadm, including the Certificate Authority (CA), Client Certificates, and Server Certificates in a Kubernetes cluster. This command ensures that the certificates remain up-to-date and secure, as expired or incorrectly configured certificates can cause connectivity issues or security vulnerabilities. When run, `kubeadm` will generate new certificates and update the relevant Kubernetes configuration files accordingly.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew all --cert-dir` is a command used to renew all the TLS certificates managed by Kubernetes using the `kubeadm` tool. The `--cert-dir` option specifies the directory where the certificates are stored. This command is typically run periodically to ensure that the certificates remain valid and secure, as they expire after a certain period of time. Renewing the certificates keeps your Kubernetes cluster secure by avoiding the use of expired or almost-expired certificates which could lead to security vulnerabilities.'
        config: '[AI] The `kubeadm certs renew all --config` command is used to renew all TLS certificates managed by Kubadm, which is a tool for deploying a production-ready Kubernetes cluster. This includes the certificates for the etcd, kube-apiserver, and kube-controller-manager components in the cluster. The `--config` flag specifies the location of the configuration directory for Kubeadm. By running this command, the certificates will be regenerated with new private keys and public certificates to maintain a secure communication within the Kubernetes cluster.'
        kubeconfig: '[AI] The `kubeadm certs renew all --kubeconfig` command is used to renew all the certificates managed by Kubadm, which is a tool for deploying a production-ready Kubernetes cluster. This command should be run periodically to ensure that the certificates remain valid and secure. The `--kubeconfig` flag specifies that the renewed certificates should be saved in the current kubeconfig file. This command does not affect the running cluster but updates the certificates for future usage. It''s important to note that renewing certificates can impact clients, so it may be necessary to update client configurations accordingly.'
