        [AI] `gh project item-create` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new project item in GitHub Projects. This command requires specifying the project ID and the key-value pairs for the item's properties, such as title, description, and labels. The basic syntax is:

        ```
        gh project item-create PROJECT_ID --title "Title" --description "Description" [--label label1] [--label label2] ...
        ```

        Replace `PROJECT_ID` with the ID of the GitHub Project, and set the title, description, and labels as desired. You can add multiple labels by including as many `--label` options as needed.

        format: '[AI] The `gh project item-create` is a command used in GitHub''s `gh` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for creating new items within a project or issue tracking system. The `--format` flag specifies the output format for the created item. This means that you can customize how the newly created item will be displayed when listed, making it easier to consume and process in scripts and other automated workflows. It is important to note that the exact available formats depend on the specifics of your project or issue tracking system, and may need to be defined or configured separately.'
        jq: '[AI] `gh` is a command-line tool for GitHub. The given command is using `gh project` subcommand with the `item-create` action. It creates a new project item, such as a milestone or issue label, in a specific GitHub project. The `--jq` flag is used to apply JSON queries with `jq` (a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor) on the output of the `gh` command. This helps in processing and manipulating the data returned by the command in various ways.'
        owner: '[AI] The `gh project item-create` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new issue, pull request, or project board item in a specific GitHub project. The `--owner` flag specifies the owner of the repository where the new item will be created. For example, `gh project item-create --title "New Feature" --body "Description of new feature" --owner username/repository` would create a new issue or pull request with title "New Feature", description "Description of new feature", and in the repository owned by "username/repository".'
        template: '[AI] The `gh project item-create` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new item in a specific project within GitHub. The `--template` option specifies the type of item to be created using a predefined template, which can help set up the item with common structure and configuration files. For instance, if you use `--template=issue`, it will create a new issue with a pre-filled issue template. This command streamlines the process of creating items within GitHub projects while ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices.'
        title: '[AI] The command `gh project item-create` is a GitHub command-line tool used to create a new project item in a GitHub Project. The `--title` option sets the title for the new project item. For instance, if you want to create an item named "Bug Fixes", you would use: `gh project item-create --title="Bug Fixes"`. This command creates the item with the given title under the default project or specifies a project key using `--project`.'
