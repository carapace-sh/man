    command: '[AI] `systemctl disable` is a Linux command used to prevent a systemd service from starting up automatically during boot. It achieves this by disabling the corresponding symlink in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory that links to the actual service file. The effect can be reversed using `systemctl enable`.'
