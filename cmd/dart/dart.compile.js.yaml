    command: '[AI] `dart:compile js` is a Dart command-line tool used to transpile (convert) Dart code into JavaScript. It takes Dart files or directories as input and generates corresponding JavaScript files that can be run in a JavaScript environment, such as web browsers. This process is important when developing Dart applications for web deployment, as most modern web platforms only support JavaScript execution.'
    flag:
        define: '[AI] `dart compile js` is a Dart command-line tool used to transpile (compile) Dart code into JavaScript. The `--define` option allows you to define symbols or constants in the output JavaScript file by providing a key-value pair. For instance, `dart compile js my_file.dart --output-file=out.js --define=MY_CONSTANT:42`. In the resulting JavaScript file, `MY_CONSTANT` will be defined as a constant with value 42. This can be useful for library authors to provide default values or for applications to customize their builds.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `dart:` protocol command you provided is actually a Dart project build tool command used in a Dart or Flutter project environment for compiling Dart code into JavaScript using the `dart:js` library. The specific command `dart compile js --help` is asking for the help and usage information of this command, which will display detailed instructions on how to use it properly with available options and arguments.

            Here are some key points about it:

            1. `dart:` - it's a protocol that allows you to run Dart commands from the terminal or command prompt.
            2. `compile` - this is the Dart command to build or compile your Dart code.
            3. `js` - specifies that you want to compile your Dart code into JavaScript.
            4. `--help` - is an option to display the help message and instructions for using the command, including available options and arguments.
        minified: '[AI] `dart compile js --minified` is a command used in Dart programming language for generating minified JavaScript output files from Dart code. When you run this command, the Dart-to-JavaScript (dart2js) compiler is invoked with the `--minified` flag which enables code compression and obfuscation during compilation, resulting in smaller and harder-to-reverse JavaScript files for production use.'
        output: |-
            [AI] The `dart:compile` command in Dart programming language, specifically the `js` sub-command with the `--output` option, is used for generating JavaScript output from Dart code.

            When you run `dart compile js --output <output_file>`, it compiles your Dart code into JavaScript and writes the resulting code to the specified output file (`<output_file>`). This command can be useful when you want to use Dart code in a JavaScript environment or when working with tools that only support JavaScript.
        verbosity: '[AI] The `dart compile js --verbosity` command is a part of Dart''s built-in toolset for generating JavaScript output from Dart code. This specific command is used to compile Dart Dart files into JavaScript with increased logging (or verbosity) for a more detailed view of the compilation process. The flags `dart:` and `compile` indicate that this is a Dart command, while `js` indicates that the desired output format is JavaScript. The `--verbosity` flag increases the amount of information printed during the compilation process to provide more insight into what''s happening behind the scenes.'
