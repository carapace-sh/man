description: Generates a migrated ChibiOS configuration file
flags:
    -d, --delete: migration will delete the input file
    -f, --force: Re-migrates an already migrated file
    -h, --help: show this help message and exit
    -i, --input=: Specify input config file.

documentation:
    command: '[AI] `qmk chibios-confmigrate` is a QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) built-in command used to migrate configuration files from ChibiOS to QMK. It reads and converts the ChibiOS project settings, then saves them as QMK keyboard layout and keymap files, enabling users to transition smoothly between these two keyboards frameworks while retaining their custom configurations.'
    flag:
        delete: |-
            [AI] The `qmk chibios-confmigrate --delete` command is used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project to delete specific configurations in the Chibios operating system's configuration files.

            Chibios is an open-source, real-time operating system that is used by QMK for developing keyboard firmware. The `chibios-confmigrate` tool is used to manage the Chibios configurations.

            The `--delete` option followed by the specific configuration name causes the tool to delete that configuration from the Chibios configuration files, allowing you to start with a clean slate when developing or modifying your QMK firmware.
        force: '[AI] `qmk chibios-confmigrate --force` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project for migrating Chibios configuration files. The `--force` flag is an option that forces the migration process to overwrite existing configuration files without any confirmation prompts, assuming that the user intends to replace those files deliberately. It is useful when upgrading Chibios and wanting to apply the new configuration settings without interruptions or manual confirmation steps during the migration process.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `qmk chibios-confmigrate` is a command-line tool used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project for migrating configuration files from Chibios to QMK. The `--help` option displays detailed usage information, including:

            1. Description: Brief explanation of the tool's purpose.
            2. Usage: Syntax and basic usage instructions.
            3. Options: List of available command line options with their descriptions. Some common options include:
               * `-p <path>`: Specify the path to the source Chibios project directory.
               * `-d <destination>`: Set the destination directory for migrated QMK files.
            4. Examples: Illustrative usage examples.
            5. Notes: Additional information or caveats related to the tool's usage.
        input: '[AI] `qmk chibios-confmigrate --input` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware platform to migrate configuration data from Chibios to QMK. The `--input` flag specifies the input directory containing the Chibios configuration files to be converted. This command facilitates moving projects from Chibios to QMK without losing existing settings and customization.'
        overwrite: '[AI] The `qmk chibios-confmigrate --overwrite` command is used in the QMK keyboard firmware project to migrate and overwrite existing ChibiOS configuration files with new ones. ChibiOS is an embedded real-time operating system used by QMK for developing keyboard firmware. The `--overwrite` flag ensures that any existing configuration files will be replaced without asking for confirmation, making the process faster and more automatic.'
        reference: '[AI] The `qmk chibios-confmigrate --reference` command is a tool used in the QMK keyboard firmware project for migrating configuration files from Chibios to QMK. Chibios and QMK are two different microcontroller libraries with their own configurations. This command reads the Chibios configuration files as a reference, allowing users to update their QMK configuration files accordingly. It does not make any changes automatically but provides a guide for manual migration.'
