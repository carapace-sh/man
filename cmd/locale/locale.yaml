    command: '[AI] The `locale` command is used to configure and display the current locale settings of your system, such as the language for character encodings and formatting of dates, numbers, and monetary values. It allows you to set the preferred locale environment variables, like LANG, LC_ALL, and others, for your shell or specific applications. By default, it displays the current locale settings. You can also use it to change the locale by specifying a desired locale, such as "en\_US.UTF-8".'
    flag:
        all-locales: '[AI] The `locale` command with the option `--all-locales` lists all available locales installed on a system. A locale is a set of parameters defining the language, cultural and territorial settings for your system''s locale environment. These settings can include things like character encodings, date and number formatting rules, currency symbols, and more. By running `locale --all-locales`, you get a comprehensive list of all installed locales on your machine.'
        category-name: '[AI] The `locale` command with the option `--category-name` is used to display a list of locale category names available on your system. These categories define different aspects of localization, such as language (LC_LANG), currency (LC_MONETARY), and measurement units (LC_MEASUREMENT). By providing this option, you can check which specific categories are supported by the installed locales on your machine.'
        charmaps: '[AI] `locale --charmaps` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to list the available character encodings or charmaps supported by the system''s localization facilities. It displays each charmap with its name and encoding standard, such as "UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1", etc. These encodings define how various characters are represented in bytes for storage and transmission. The command helps ensure that text data is correctly interpreted and displayed across different applications and systems, which is essential in multilingual and internationalized environments.'
        help: '[AI] The `locale` command with the `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use the `locale` utility for setting and displaying the locale-related variables, such as language, encoding, and regional settings, in Unix-like operating systems. It provides a list of supported options and their descriptions.'
        keyword-name: '[AI] The `locale` command in Unix-based systems is used to set and configure various locale-related environment variables, determining the regional settings for a given shell session or system. The `--keyword-name` option is used with this command to display the name of a specific locale category keyword. For instance, using `locale --keyword-names LANG` would output a list containing keywords like "C", "en_US.UTF-8" or "fr_FR.UTF-8", representing various language and regional locales supported by the system.'
        usage: '[AI] The `locale` command with the `--usage` option is used to display a brief help message about how to use the `locale` utility in the terminal or command line interface of Unix-based operating systems. It provides information on the various options and arguments that can be passed to the `locale` command for setting, printing, or manipulating the current locale environment variables. These variables determine the default language and regional settings for various aspects of the system, such as date formats, number formatting, and character encoding. By running `locale --usage`, users can quickly understand how to set and manage their system''s locale settings.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `locale --verbose` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems that displays detailed information about the current locale settings. It lists all the specific LC_ categories and their corresponding values, such as LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_NUMERIC, LC_TIME, and others. This can be useful for debugging localization issues or understanding the current locale configuration.'
        version: '[AI] The `locale` command with the `--version` option is used to display the version information of the installed locale utility in your system. It provides details such as the version number, installation date, and other relevant information.
