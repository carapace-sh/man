    command: '[AI] `journalctl` is a command-line utility in Linux systems used to query, display, and manage the system journal files. These journals record various system events, messages, and logs from system services and applications. With `journalctl`, you can view real-time log output, search for specific messages or errors, filter by priority level, and more. It provides a flexible interface to interact with the journal subsystem, allowing administrators and developers to easily monitor and troubleshoot their systems.'
    flag:
        after-cursor: '[AI] `journalctl --after-cursor` is a command used in Linux systems to display the system logs that have been generated after a specific timestamp or marker represented by a cursor. The `--after-cursor` option specifies the cursor, which can be obtained from the output of previous `journalctl` commands using the `--output=json` option and extracting the key "CURSOR" from the JSON output. This command is useful for following logs in real-time or examining logs that have been generated after a certain event occurred.'
        all: '[AI] `journalctl --all` is a command used in Linux systems to display the entire system log stored in the journal. The option `--all` means that it will show logs from all logs files (also known as journals) available on the system. These logs may include kernel messages, system messages, and messages from applications and services. It provides detailed information about various system activities, errors, warnings, and other relevant events, making it a valuable tool for troubleshooting and system monitoring.'
        boot: '[AI] The `journalctl` command is a utility in the systemd initiative used to query and manage the Linux kernel and system logs. The `--boot` option is used to display the boot-time journal messages, which include system startup and shutdown events. These messages provide valuable insights into system boot processes and any issues that occurred during system initialization.'
        case-sensitive: '[AI] The `journalctl` command is a utility in Linux systems used to query and display the system journal files. The option `--case-sensitive` is used when searching for journal entries to ensure that the search term matches exactly with the logged data, including case sensitivity of letters. This means that a search for "Error" will not return results containing the word "warning" or "error" (in any case), ensuring more accurate results.'
        catalog: '[AI] The `journalctl --catalog` command is used in systemd to display the current system journal configuration. It shows details about where journal files are stored, their maximum size, and other relevant settings for the system journal. This information can be useful when troubleshooting journal issues or configuring journal behavior.'
        cursor: '[AI] `journalctl --cursor` is a command used in Linux systems to display the kernel log entry right before the specified point in the system journal.

        cursor-file: '[AI] `journalctl --cursor-file` is a command used in Linux systems to retrieve journal entries from the system log based on a specific marker or cursor stored in a file. The cursor file contains the position pointer for reading log entries from a particular point in the journal file, making it useful for querying logs from a specific moment without having to start from the beginning of the log files each time. This command is especially helpful when dealing with large log files and repetitive queries.'
        directory: '[AI] `journalctl --directory` is a command used in Linux systems to list the directories where the system journal files are stored. The `journalctl` utility is a versatile tool for querying and managing the system logs. By using the `--directory` option, it displays a list of available journal file locations under the standard journal directory `/var/log/journal`. These files contain information about system events and can be useful for troubleshooting and investigating system issues.'
        disk-usage: '[AI] `journalctl --disk-usage` is a command used in Linux systems to display the disk usage of the journal files created by systemd. The output shows the size and the number of logs for each journal (e.g., syslog, kernel, audit, etc.) stored in the journal directory (usually located at /var/log/journal). It helps administrators monitor and manage the journal file disk space consumption effectively.'
        dmesg: '[AI] `journalctl` is a command-line utility in Linux for querying and displaying the system journal, which stores system messages and events. The option `--dmesg` retrieves the kernel message buffer, also known as "dmesg output". It shows a record of recent kernel messages, including hardware detection events, driver loading/unloading messages, and other important system messages that are typically displayed during boot-up or when using the dmesg command. These messages can be useful for troubleshooting system issues.'
        dump-catalog: '[AI] `journalctl --dump-catalog` is a command used in systemd-based Linux distributions to retrieve metadata about the journal files, which are stored in the Journal Disk Filesystem (Journald). The output of this command includes information such as the available journal levels, keys and their types, and other relevant details that can be useful for debugging or analyzing logs. It does not display actual log entries, but rather provides a catalog or index of the journal data, allowing users to query it programmatically.'
        facility: '[AI] `journalctl --facility` is a command used in Linux systems to filter the system journal based on the specified facility. A facility is a categorization of log messages indicating the application or subsystem that generated the message. For example, `--facility=kernel` will display only kernel messages, while `--facility=network` will display network-related messages. This command helps in isolating and analyzing specific types of logs for troubleshooting and monitoring purposes.'
        field: '[AI] `journalctl --field` is a command used in Linux systems to filter and display logs based on a specific journal field. The `--field` option allows specifying a key or value of a log entry''s metadata, such as `--field=REALTIME`. This command can be helpful for quickly querying and analyzing system logs, providing more focused output compared to other methods like searching for strings or messages. For example, `journalctl --field=MESSAGE --match="Failed password"` would display only the log entries with a message containing "Failed password" in their metadata field.'
        fields: '[AI] `journalctl --fields` is a command used in the Linux system to filter and display specific fields or columns from the system journal files. The `--fields` option specifies the list of desired fields, separated by commas. For example, `journalctl --fields=_SYSTEMD_UNIT,_MESSAGE` will output the system unit name (_SYSTEMS_UNIT) and message column (_MESSAGE_) for each journal entry. This command helps in extracting specific information from logs with ease.'
        file: '[AI] `journalctl --file` is a command used in Linux systems to display the contents of a specific journal file. The journal files store system logs and can be accessed using the `journalctl` utility. By adding `--file` option followed by the path to a specific journal file, you can view the logs contained within that file only.'
        flush: '[AI] `journalctl --flush` is a command used in Linux systems to forcibly write all pending journal entries from the system''s journal files to stable storage, ensuring they are persisted even if the system crashes or is power-cycled. This can be useful during troubleshooting or when performing system maintenance tasks where it''s important that recent logs are not lost. The command does not display any output by default; its primary function is to write journal entries to disk as quickly and efficiently as possible.'
        follow: '[AI] `journalctl --follow` is a command used in Linux systems to real-time follow and display the messages in the system journal files. The `--follow` option enables live tracking of journal entries as they are being written, allowing users to monitor logs in near real-time. This can be particularly useful for observing system activity and troubleshooting issues.'
        force: '[AI] The `journalctl --force` command is used to forcibly reload the system journal in Systemd. This means that any new logs that are being written to the journal files will be immediately displayed when running the command, even if they have not been rotated or processed yet. It''s useful when you want to see real-time log output without waiting for the normal rotation and processing cycle.'
        grep: '[AI] `journalctl` is a command-line utility in Linux systems used to query and display the system journal files, which store system logs. The option `--grep` followed by a search term allows filtering the output of journalctl based on that specific keyword or phrase. For example, running `journalctl --grep=kernel` would show only the log entries containing the word "kernel".'
        header: '[AI] `journalctl --header` is a command used in Linux systems to display metadata information about the most recent log entry in the system journal. The option `--header` provides this output, which typically includes the timestamp, PID (process ID), and message priority level of the logged event. It''s useful for quickly identifying specific logs or gaining an overview of the latest system activity.'
        help: |-

The option `--identifier` allows specifying a string that matches the identifier field in journal entries, helping to filter and find relevant logs easily.'
        image: '[AI] `journalctl --image` is a command used in Linux systems to display the system journal as an image or graphical representation using the `imagemagick` tool for better visualization of journal data. It combines the output of `journalctl` with `convert`, which is part of the `imagemagick` package, to generate images like heatmaps or histograms that illustrate the log events based on their priority levels, timestamps, or other attributes. This can be helpful for quickly identifying trends, patterns or anomalies within the logs.'
        interval: '[AI] `journalctl` is a command-line utility for accessing and querying the systemd journal in Linux. The `--interval` option allows filtering the log entries based on a time interval. For example, `journalctl --since="1h ago"` displays the logs from the last hour or `journalctl --between="2022-01-01 09:00:00" "--2022-01-01 17:00:00"` shows the logs between specific dates and times. The output can be further refined using other options such as `--unit`, `--boost` or `--no-pager`.'
        lines: '[AI] `journalctl --lines` is a command used in Linux systems to view the last n lines of the system journal files. The system journal stores messages related to various system activities. By using the option `--lines` followed by a number, you can specify how many lines you want to display from the end of the journal file. For example, `journalctl --lines 10` will show the last 10 lines of the journal.'
        list-boots: '[AI] `journalctl --list-boots` is a command used in Linux systems to list the available kernel boot records in the system journal. The output displays the boot ID, start time, elapsed time, and status for each boot event. It helps system administrators to quickly identify and check the logs of previous boots for troubleshooting purposes or to review system startup activity.'
        list-catalog: '[AI] `journalctl --list-catalog` is a command used in systemd-based Linux distributions to list the available journal catalogs, which are configurations that define where and how logs are stored. Each catalog defines a name, location, and other properties for log files or their on-disk format. By listing the catalogs, you can identify and manage different logging configurations.'
        machine: '[AI] The `journalctl` command is a utility in systemd, used to query the system journal in Linux. The option `--machine=MACHINE_NAME` filters the output to show only logs for a specific machine or Syslog identifier. This can be useful when managing logs from multiple systems or services. It allows administrators to easily view and analyze logs related to a particular machine or service.'
        merge: '[AI] `journalctl --merge` is a command used in the system logging service of Linux distributions, such as systemd. It merges multiple journal files into a single output stream, providing a more convenient way to view the logs from multiple systems or processes, all in one place. This command is particularly useful when dealing with distributed systems or complex setups where logs are spread across multiple files or servers. The result is a clearer and more comprehensive log output that can be further filtered and searched as needed.'
        namespace: '[AI] The `journalctl` command is a utility in Systemd for querying and displaying the system journal. The `--namespace` option is used to filter journal messages based on a specific namespace. A namespace is a container for journal logs, where each process or system component can maintain its own log. By specifying a namespace with `--namespace`, you can view only the logs related to that specific component or process. For example, `journalctl --namespace=kernel` would display only kernel logs.'
        no-full: '[AI] `journalctl --no-full` is a command used in Linux systems to view the system logs stored in the journal file. The `--no-full` option requests that only the truncated version of each log entry be displayed, rather than the full and detailed format which includes extra metadata like timestamps, PID, and other identification information. This can make the output more concise and easier to read when searching for specific log messages.'
        no-hostname: '[AI] `journalctl` is a command-line utility in the systemd initiative for Linux operating systems used to query and examine the system journal files. The option `--no-hostname` is used with `journalctl` to suppress or exclude the display of the hostname while showing the journal entries. This can be useful when working with multiple systems, as it helps differentiate between logs from each system more easily.'
        no-pager: '[AI] `journalctl` is a command-line utility used to query the systemd journal in Linux. The option `--no-pager` prevents the output from being paginated, meaning it will not be broken up into multiple screens or pages, and instead, all the output will be displayed on the terminal in one go. This can be useful when dealing with large logs or when you want to parse the output using other tools.'
        no-tail: '[AI] `journalctl --no-tail` is a command used in Linux systems to display the system log files managed by the journald daemon. The `--no-tail` option tells journalctl not to show the latest 10 lines of the log files, but instead displays all available logs from the beginning. This can be useful when looking for older logs or debugging issues that may have occurred some time ago.'
        output: |-
            [AI] `journalctl` is a command-line utility used to query the systemd journal, which stores log messages in Linux systems. The `--output` option specifies how the output should be formatted or where it should be sent. Here are some common uses:

            * `--output=cat`: Prints the log messages directly to the terminal.
            * `--output=json-pretty`: Displays the logs in a human-readable JSON format.
            * `--output=short`: Outputs only the essential information (timestamp, priority level, and message) in tabular format.
            * `--output=none`: Does not display any output but writes it to a file or another destination.
            * `--output=kms`: Encrypts the journal data before displaying it on the console for security purposes.
            * Redirecting output to a file: `journalctl > output.log`.

            Using these options, you can customize how you view and handle log messages from your system.
        output-fields: '[AI] `journalctl` is a command-line utility in Systemd that interacts with the system journal to query, print, and manage logs. The option `--output-fields` specifies which log fields to display when querying the journal. It takes one or more field names as arguments, separating multiple fields with commas. For example, `journalctl --output-fields=REALTIME,MESSAGE` would display the realtime and message fields in the log entries. This can help filter and parse logs more efficiently.'
        pager-end: '[AI] `journalctl --pager-end` is a command used in systemd-based Linux distributions to display the last few lines of the system journal. The option `--pager-end` tells the utility to output only the last 10 lines of the journal and then exit, making it useful when quickly checking recent log entries without having to scroll through an extensive log file manually.'
        priority: '[AI] `journalctl` is a command-line utility for accessing and querying the systemd journal in Linux. The option `--priority` allows filtering journal logs based on their priority level. Journal entries are recorded with different priority levels, ranging from EMERGENCY (0) to DEBUG (7), indicating the severity of the event. By using `--priority`, you can limit the output to show only the logs with a specified priority level or higher. For example, `journalctl --priority=INFO` would display logs with an INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRIT, ALERT or EMERGENCY priority.'
        quiet: '[AI] `journalctl --quiet` is a command used in Linux systems to retrieve the most recent system log messages, but with minimal output. The `--quiet` option suppresses the default output prefixes (such as timestamps and logging levels) and only displays the actual message content. This can be useful when automated scripts or tools are processing the logs for further analysis.'
        relinquish-var: '[AI] The command `journalctl --relinquish-var` is used in systemd journal handling to release ownership of a specific journal variable from the current user or system process to another user or process. This action allows the specified variable to be controlled by another entity, granting them the ability to modify its value for future journal entries. It''s essential for maintaining flexibility and managing access control within journal logs.'
        reverse: '[AI] `journalctl --reverse` is a command used in Linux systems to display the system log files in reverse order, meaning that the most recent entries are displayed first instead of last. This can be useful for quickly checking the latest system events or debugging issues where you want to focus on the most recent logs without having to scroll through older entries.'
        root: '[AI] `journalctl --root` is a command used in Linux systems to query the system log files stored in the root filesystem, rather than the logs located in the default location under `/var/log`. This command uses the `journalctl` utility, which is part of the systemd package. By adding the `--root` option, you are telling journalctl to search for logs in the root filesystem instead of the one where the current system resides. This can be useful when working with remote systems or analyzing logs from a system that no longer operates.'
        rotate: '[AI] `journalctl --rotate` is a command used in systemd-based Linux distributions to rotate the system journal files. The rotation is typically configured to occur when a journal file reaches a specified size. Rotating the journal files helps manage disk space and keeps older journal data accessible for troubleshooting or auditing purposes without filling up available storage. The command itself does not physically rotate the files but triggers the scheduled rotation process. After rotation, the new journal data is written to a fresh file while the old one remains available under a predefined naming convention (e.g., `journal.*`).'
        setup-keys: '[AI] `journalctl --setup-keys` is a command used in systemd-based Linux distributions to create or modify custom journal keys for filtering and querying system logs using the journalctl utility. These keys help users to easily search for specific log messages based on their severity, facility, or other custom tags. The command allows defining new keys as well as modifying existing ones in the journal configuration file (usually located at /etc/systemd/journal-enabled). Using this command simplifies and improves the process of managing and analyzing system logs.'
        show-cursor: '[AI] `journalctl --show-cursor` is a command used with the systemd journal to display the current position or cursor of the log stream. This means that it shows the most recent entry in the journal files, providing information about when and by what it was written. The cursor represents the point from which new log entries will be appended, making it useful for identifying the end of a specific log session or for keeping track of log output during troubleshooting.'
        since: '[AI] `journalctl --since` is a command used in Linux systems to query the system journal files. The `--since` option specifies that only logs generated after a certain point in time should be displayed. For example, `journalctl --since "15 minutes ago"` would display logs from the last 15 minutes. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues or monitoring system activity over a specific time frame.'
        smart-relinquish-var: '[AI] `journalctl --smart-relinquish-var` is a command used in systemd-journal to release the ownership of journal files that have been kept open for too long by a process or user. The `--smart` option allows systemd to automatically select the oldest journal files that can be safely removed based on their age and access patterns, making it an efficient way to manage journal file size and disk space usage.'
        sync: '[AI] The `journalctl --sync` command is used to immediately write all pending journal entries to stable storage in the systemd journal in Linux. This ensures that all journal data is persisted and can be accessed even if the system crashes or loses power before the journal files are normally rotated or synced. It''s an important tool for ensuring the integrity of journal data and making sure that logs can be properly reviewed for troubleshooting or analysis purposes.'
        system: '[AI] `journalctl --system` is a command used in Linux systems to query the system journal files managed by the systemd logging service. The `--system` option filters the output to show only logs from system services and the kernel, excluding user-space applications'' logs. This can be useful for troubleshooting system issues or monitoring system activity.'
        unit: '[AI] `journalctl --unit` is a command used in Linux systems to display the system journal for a specific systemd unit file. Systemd is a popular system and service manager for Linux operating systems. The `--unit` option filters the output to show only the logs related to the specified unit file, which can be provided as an argument after the option. This command helps in debugging and monitoring the status of specific services or units.'
        until: '[AI] `journalctl --until` is a command used in Linux systems to query the system journal for logs that match certain criteria, specifically logs generated before a given time. The time can be specified using various formats, such as relative terms like "5 minutes ago" or absolute dates and times. For example, `journalctl --until 1 hour ago` would display logs from the last hour. This command is useful for troubleshooting system issues or analyzing system activity over a specific time period.'
        update-catalog: '[AI] `journalctl --update-catalog` is a command in Systemd, which manages and maintains the system journal. This command updates the catalog of the journal files, making sure that the metadata (such as timestamps, log levels, and identifiers) of journal entries are correctly indexed and can be efficiently searched using tools like `journalctl` or `systemd-journal-devils`. The updated catalog also enables faster filtering and parsing of journal data.'
        user: '[AI] `journalctl --user` is a command used in Linux systems to query the journal files of the user-space logs. These logs are separate from the system logs and are managed by the `systemd-journald` service for each individual user. The output can be filtered, searched, or displayed in various formats using additional options with `journalctl`. This command helps in troubleshooting and monitoring applications and their corresponding user-level activities.'
        user-unit: '[AI] `journalctl --user-unit` is a command used in Linux systems to view the system logs of user-defined journald units. The `--user-unit` option filters the output to show only the logs related to specified user units, which are units configured by users for their own processes. These units are stored under the `/etc/systemd/user/` directory instead of in the default system configuration files located at `/etc/systemd/`. This command helps administrators and users troubleshoot issues with their applications by examining the logs associated with their user units.'
        utc: '[AI] `journalctl` is a command-line utility used to query the systemd journal in Linux. The option `--utc` sets the output format to UTC time, which stands for Coordinated Universal Time. It ensures that all timestamps displayed are based on this standard time format, regardless of the local time settings.'
        vacuum-files: '[AI] `journalctl --vacuum-files` is a command used in systemd-based Linux distributions to manage and clean up old and unnecessary journal files. The `--vacuum-files` option triggers the vacuuming process, which reclaims disk space by deleting old and redundant logs that are no longer needed while keeping the system''s journals intact. This helps maintain a reasonable amount of disk space for the logs without losing critical information.'
        vacuum-size: '[AI] `journalctl --vacuum-size` is a command used with the system journal in Linux. It''s designed to manage and optimize the size of the journal files by removing old and unnecessary data, thus freeing up disk space. The `--vacuum-size` option specifies the minimum amount of free disk space that should be left after running the vacuuming process. For example, `journalctl --vacuum-size=50M` would remove data from the journals to ensure at least 50 megabytes of free space remains on the filesystem after vacuuming is completed.'
        vacuum-time: '[AI] `journalctl --vacuum-time` is a command used in systemd-journald, the journal service of the Linux operating system. This command is used to automatically remove old and unnecessary journal files based on the specified time. The option `--vacuum-time` takes a time argument in the format "[[hh]mm][[dd-mm|mm-dd|yyyy-mm-dd]]", which represents the minimum retention time for journal files. All journal files older than this specified time will be deleted to save disk space.'
        verify: '[AI] `journalctl --verify` is a command used in systemd-based Linux distributions to check the integrity of the journal files. It compares the current journals against their checksums stored in the journal index file to ensure no data has been tampered or lost. If the verification is successful, it will output "Journal files are consistent". If not, it will alert with an error message and suggest taking appropriate actions such as repairing or restoring the journals.'
        verify-key: '[AI] `journalctl --verify-key` is a command used in systemd-based Linux distributions to verify the authenticity of journal files using public keys stored in the system''s trusted keyring. By running this command followed by the path to a journal file, the system checks if the file''s signature matches the given key, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of the logs.'
        version: '[AI] `journalctl --version` is a command used in Linux systems to check the version of the journald utility, which is responsible for maintaining and managing the system logs. The output will display the version number of journald, providing users with important information about the specific version they have installed and its potential features or bug fixes.'
