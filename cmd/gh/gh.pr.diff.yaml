    command: '[AI] `gh pr diff` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to view the differences between two branches or pull requests. It allows users to inspect the changes made in the files before merging or applying those changes. The output will display the added, modified, and deleted lines for each file included in the comparison.'
    flag:
        color: '[AI] `gh pr diff --color` is a GitHub CLI command used to display the difference between two branches or commits in a GitHub repository. The `--color` option enables syntax highlighting and makes it easier to distinguish different types of changes, such as additions, deletions, and modifications. In summary, this command shows the differences between two versions of code with improved readability.'
        name-only: '[AI] The `gh pr diff --name-only` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to display only the names of the changed files in a pull request difference. It helps users quickly identify which files have been modified between two branches without having to review the entire diff content.'
        patch: '[AI] `gh pr diff --patch` is a GitHub CLI command used to view the patch differences of a pull request. The `--patch` option displays the differences in the patch format, which is a textual representation of file changes, including added or deleted lines and their locations. It provides a more detailed and flexible way to review and understand the proposed changes.'
        web: '[AI] `gh pr diff --web` is a GitHub command used to view the difference between two branches or pull requests in a web browser. The `gh` is the GitHub CLI tool, `pr` refers to pulling requests, and `diff` means displaying the differences between the commits. The `--web` option opens the diff preview in your default web browser instead of the command line.'
