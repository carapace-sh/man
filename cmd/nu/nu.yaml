documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "nu" command is not a standard command in any commonly used computing environment or programming language. It might be specific to certain tools or applications, but without more context it''s impossible to provide an accurate explanation.'
    flag:
        commands: '[AI] The `nu --commands` flag is a command-line option for Nu, a tool for managing Kubernetes applications. This flag is used to display all available commands and their usage information in Nu CLI. It helps users understand what actions they can take with Nu and how to use those actions effectively.'
        config: |-
            [AI] The `nu --config` command in Nu, a .NET CLI tool for building and deploying applications, is used to manage configuration files. Specifically, it allows you to:

            1. Create a new config file with a given name and format (e.g., `json`, `hcl`, or `toml`).
            2. Display the content of an existing config file.
            3. Update the values in an existing config file based on changes made in your codebase.
            4. Merge changes from multiple branches into a single config file.
            5. Validate the syntax and structure of your config file.

            Using `nu --config` helps keep your application configuration files in sync with your source code, ensuring a consistent deployment process.
        env-config: '[AI] The `nu --env-config` flag is a command used in Nu, a CLI tool for managing and deploying applications. It loads environment configuration files into the Nu project''s context, making these configurations available to be referenced by other Nu commands or deployed with the application. This flag enhances the flexibility of managing environments and their configurations in a Nu project.'
        execute: '[AI] The `nu --execute` flag is a command-line option for the NuGet package manager. It''s used to directly execute a single .NET script, console application, or custom tool included within a NuGet package without installing the entire package first. This can save time when working with large projects or testing specific functionalities of packages. By passing this flag along with the path to the desired executable file within the package, you can bypass the installation step and run it directly from the command line.'
        help: '[AI] `nu help` is a command used in the Nu Get package manager for .NET development. It displays detailed help information about various NuGet commands and their usage. The `--help` flag is an optional argument that requests this detailed help output, providing users with clear instructions on how to effectively use NuGet within their projects.'
        ide-ast: '[AI] The `--ide-ast` flag in NuGet is used to enable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) IntelliSense and Autocomplete features when restoring or installing packages with NuGet Package Manager. It improves the user experience by providing suggestions and completions while writing code, reducing errors and increasing productivity. This flag is particularly useful for developers working in IDE environments like Visual Studio.'
        ide-check: '[AI] The `--ide-check` flag is a command-line option used in NuGet, the package manager for .NET. This flag instructs NuGet to perform an extra check during the installation or update of packages to ensure that the target project or solution is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)-project or -solution and not a plain .NET Console Application or Library project. By performing this check, NuGet can provide additional features such as IntelliSense, code navigation, and other IDE-specific functionalities. This flag helps maintain the development experience consistency when working on larger solutions with multiple projects using different types.'
        ide-complete: '[AI] The `--ide-complete` flag is a command-line option used in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and other IDEs or text editors that support the Ide-Remote extension. This flag is passed to the `code` command for remote development workflows, enabling features like IntelliSense, syntax highlighting, and other code completion functionalities when working with a remote repository over SSH. It helps bridge the gap between the local development environment and the remote server, providing an enhanced coding experience in the IDE.'
        ide-goto-def: '[AI] The `--ide-goto-def` flag is a command-line option used in the NuGet package manager for global commands, specifically the `dotnet nuget` command. This flag instructs the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to navigate to the definition of a given symbol or type when installed packages are selected. It enhances the development experience by streamlining the process of jumping between source code and related package definitions within an IDE, making it easier to understand the context and origin of referenced code.'
        ide-hover: '[AI] The `--ide-hover` flag is a command-line option for Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and other integrated development environments (IDEs). It enables hover functionality, which displays quick information or tooltips when the user hovers over code elements like variables, functions, or keywords. This feature helps users gain valuable context instantly without leaving the editor, making the coding experience more efficient and productive.'
        include-path: '[AI] The `--include-path` flag is used with the C compiler `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection) and other compilers that support it. It specifies a list of directories where to search for header files (files with the `.h` extension) when compiling source code. The flag helps include headers from locations other than the default system and compiler-specific directories, allowing for better control over project dependencies.'
        interactive: '[AI] The `nu --interactive` flag is used with the NuGet Package Manager, a popular tool for installing and managing .NET packages. This flag enables an interactive session where users can run commands directly in the console instead of providing a package name or file path as an argument. It allows for ad-hoc usage and exploration of available NuGet functions.'
        log-level: |-
            [AI] The `--log-level` flag in Nu, a data processing language, is used to set the log level for output messages. Log levels determine the severity and visibility of messages written to the logs. Common log levels include:

            1. Trace: Detailed debugging information.
            2. Debug: Important debugging information.
            3. Info: Informational messages about program flow.
            4. Warn: Non-critical warning messages.
            5. Error: Critical error messages, indicating failures that halt the program.
            6. Fatal: Severe fatal errors causing immediate termination.
            7. Panic: Extreme cases of fatal errors leading to panic and drastic actions.

            By passing a specific log level as an argument with `--log-level`, you can control the amount and type of information printed in Nu's logs. For example, using `--log-level=info` would only display informational messages, while `--log-level=error` would only display error messages.
        log-target: '[AI] The `--log-target` flag in NuGet, a package manager for .NET, specifies where to send log output during package restoration or push/pull operations. Valid options include `Console`, `File`, and `Null`. When set to `Console`, logs are displayed in the terminal. With `File`, logs are written to a specified file path. The `Null` option suppresses all logging output.'
        login: '[AI] The `nu --login` command is used in the Nuclio serverless platform to initiate a login session. This command allows users to authenticate and authorize access to Nuclio features, such as deploying functions or managing workspaces. After logging in, users can interact with the Nuclio API using tools like `nuctl`, the Nuclio CLI.'
        no-config-file: '[AI] The `--no-config-file` flag in Nu, a configuration management system, instructs Nu not to read or use any external configuration files during execution. This means that all configurations and settings must be provided directly on the command line or through other means (like environment variables) instead of being loaded from a file.'
        no-std-lib: '[AI] The `nu --no-std-lib` flag is used in the Nu programming language when running a script or application. It disables the use of the standard Nu library, which includes commonly used functions and modules. This flag can be useful for creating minimalist applications or when working with custom libraries that may conflict with the standard library. By explicitly specifying no usage of the standard library, the control over dependencies is more precise.'
        plugin-config: '[AI] The `nu --plugin-config` command is used with Nuclio, an open-source event-driven serverless platform. This command is employed to configure plugin settings for specific Nuclio components (functions or services). Plugins extend the functionality of Nuclio by adding custom behavior or integrating with third-party tools. To use `nu --plugin-config`, you provide the plugin name and a JSON file containing the configuration data, which is then stored in the Nuclio registry for that specific component.'
        stdin: '[AI] The `nu --stdin` flag is used with the Nu programming language compiler. It indicates that the standard input should be used as the source code to compile, instead of a file specified on the command line. In other words, it allows you to provide the code directly in the terminal or console, making it convenient for quick experiments and interactive usage.'
        table-mode: '[AI] The `nu --table-mode` flag is a command-line option for the data processing tool `nu`, specifically used to display output in tabular format. When this option is provided, `nu` will convert its input into a neatly formatted table with properly aligned columns and clear column headers. This makes it easier for users to understand and analyze large datasets, as the data is presented in an organized and readable manner.'
        testbin: '[AI] The `--testbin` flag in NPM (Node Package Manager) is used to specify a custom location of the Node.js binary used for running tests within an NPM project. This is useful when testing code that requires a specific version or configuration of Node.js which may differ from the default system installation.'
        threads: '[AI] The `--threads` option in NuGet, a package manager for .NET, specifies the number of parallel background threads to use during the restore process. This can help improve the speed of the restore operation by allowing multiple packages to be downloaded and restored concurrently. However, setting too many threads may lead to increased resource usage or potential conflicts, so it''s generally recommended to find an optimal value based on your system''s CPU and available memory.'
        version: '[AI] `nu --version` is a command used in Nu, a tool for managing and deploying dotnet applications. This command is used to display the version information of the installed Nu CLI (Command Line Interface) client. It helps users to verify they have the latest or desired version of Nu installed for their development tasks.'
