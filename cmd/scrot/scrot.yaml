documentation:
    command: '[AI] `scrot` is a command-line utility for taking screenshots in Linux systems. It captures the contents of the entire screen or a selected rectangular region and saves it as an image file, typically in PNG format. To use it, specify the desired output filename followed by the capture options such as the selection mode, window ID, or coordinates. For example: `scrot screenshot.png` captures the whole screen and saves it as "screenshot.png".'
    flag:
        autoselect: '[AI] `scrot` is a screen shooting utility in Linux. The option `--autoselect` automatically saves the most recently taken screenshot as the default selection when using the tool multiple times in quick succession. In other words, it allows you to take several screenshots one after another, and the last one taken becomes the one that is saved by default when you don''t specify a filename or use an existing filename. This can be useful for capturing multiple related screenshots quickly and efficiently.'
        border: '[AI] The `--border` option in the `scrot` screenshot tool is used to include a border around the captured image. This border can be useful for various reasons, such as easier alignment when combining multiple images or adding annotations. The size and color of the border are customizable. For example, `--border 10x10+5+5` sets the border width to 10 pixels on each side and shifts the capture area by 5 pixels in both directions.'
        class: '[AI] `scrot` is a command-line screenshot tool for X11-based Linux systems. The option `--class` is used to take a screenshot of a specific window or application with the given class name. For example, `scrot --class "Firefox"` would capture an image only of the Firefox browser window. This can be useful when you want to save multiple related images without the need for manual cropping afterwards.'
        count: '[AI] `scrot` is a command-line utility for taking screenshots in Linux. The option `--count=NUM` is used to specify that `scrot` should take `NUM` number of screenshots in a row, each with the default behavior (save as PNG files in the current directory with names `SC-YYMMDDHHMMSS.png`). For example, `scrot --count=3` would take three screenshots consecutively.'
        delay: '[AI] `scrot` is a screenshot tool in Linux. The command `scrot --delay` sets a delay before taking a screenshot. For example, `scrot --delay 5 --duration 10000` would take a screenshot 5 seconds after the command is executed and wait for 10000 milliseconds (approximately 28 seconds) before saving or outputting the image data. This can be useful if you want to capture an image of a moving element on the screen that appears after a delay.'
        display: '[AI] The `scrot` is a command-line screenshot tool for Linux and other Unix-like systems. The `--display` option specifies which X Window System display to capture a screenshot from. For example, `scrot --display=:0.0 image.png` would take a screenshot of the primary display (:0.0). If no display option is provided, scrot defaults to the local TTY or virtual console.'
        exec: |-
            [AI] `scrot` is a screenshot tool in Linux, and the option `--exec` is used to specify a command or a script that gets executed after taking a screenshot. The general syntax for using this option is:

            ```bash
            scrot <options> <screenshot-name> --exec command "arguments"
            ```

            After capturing the screenshot, `scrot` executes the given command or script in the terminal with the specified arguments. This can be useful for automating tasks, like renaming the captured image file or sending it through an email or a messaging app.
        focused: '[AI] The term "scrotum-focused" does not directly refer to a flag or symbol. It is an anatomical term describing an emphasis on or focus towards the scrotum, which is the external sac that contains the testicles in male anatomy. There is no widely recognized symbol or flag associated with this term.'
        freeze: '[AI] The `scrot` is a command-line screen capture tool for X11 systems. The option `--freeze` is used to temporarily freeze the screen during the screenshot process, preventing any changes from being made in real time to the parts of the screen being captured. This can be helpful when trying to take a screenshot of a specific window or interface that may be moving or changing while the capture is being taken. Once the screenshot has been saved, the frozen screen will return to normal operation.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `scrot` is a command-line tool for taking screenshots in Linux. The `--help` option displays a brief help message when used with the `scrot` command, providing an overview of its usage and available options.

            Here's a concise summary:

            The `scrot --help` command prints out a brief help message containing:

            1. A short description of scrot as a screenshot tool.
            2. The basic syntax for using the command to take a screenshot: `scrot [OPTIONS] FILENAME`.
            3. A list of available options, such as:
               * `-r` or `--region`: Specify the region of the screen to capture.
               * `-s` or `--select`: Use a pointer or keyboard input to select an area to capture.
               * `-c` or `--copy`: Copy the selection to the clipboard and save it as a file.
               * `-p` or `--pause`: Display a crosshair cursor, pause for a button press before capturing.
            4. Information on how to see more detailed help and usage examples using the manual page (`man scrot`) or online resources.
        line: '[AI] The `scrot` is a command-line tool for taking screenshots in Linux. The option `--line` or `-l` is used to specify a rectangle area to capture, with its top left coordinates and width and height given as numbers, separated by spaces. For example, `scrot --line=10 20 50 30` will take a screenshot of a rectangular region starting at position (10, 20) with the size of 50 pixels wide and 30 pixels high.'
        multidisp: '[AI] The `--multidisp` flag is a command-line option used with the `scrot` screenshot tool in Linux and other Unix-like systems. This flag instructs `scrot` to capture multiple non-overlapping rectangular areas of the screen in a single command, instead of taking separate screenshots for each area. The resulting image is saved as a multi-page file (typically a PDF or a series of PNG files) that can be viewed and edited using appropriate software. This flag improves workflow efficiency when dealing with multiple screenshot regions in one go.'
        note: '[AI] The `scrot` is a command-line screen capture tool for X11 window systems, often used in Linux distributions. The option `--note` is not a standard or widely used feature of `scrot`. It seems to be specific to certain configurations or setups. When used, it appears to append a timestamp and a brief note to the filename of the captured image file. For example, if the command is `scrot --note="My note" myscreenshot.png`, the resulting image file will be saved as `myscreenshot-2023-03-17_15:16:48-My note.png`. This can be useful for organizing and labeling screenshots.'
        overwrite: '[AI] The `--overwrite` flag in the `scrot` screen capture tool is used to replace an existing file with the same name when saving a screenshot. If this option is not specified, `scrot` will append a numeric suffix to the filename if it already exists, preventing overwriting. With `--overwrite`, the new screenshot will directly replace the previous one.'
        pointer: '[AI] The `scrot` is a command-line utility for taking screenshots in Linux and other Unix-like systems. The `--pointer` option is used to include the mouse pointer in the captured image. When you run `scrot --fullscreen --pointer`, it takes a full screen shot with the mouse pointer visible in the image.'
        quality: '[AI] The `--quality` flag in the `scrot` screenshot tool is used to specify the output image format and compression level. It takes an optional argument, where a number from 0 to 100 represents the compression level (higher numbers result in smaller file sizes but potentially lower image quality). For example, `--quality 75` would produce a JPEG image with a moderate compression level. If no `--quality` option is provided, the default uncompressed PNG format will be used.'
        script: |-
            [AI] The `scrot` command with the `--script` option is used in Linux for taking a screenshot and executing additional scripts after the capture. The basic syntax is:

            ```bash
            scrot --script=path_to_script.sh <options>
            ```

            Here, replace `path_to_script.sh` with the location of your script file that contains the commands you want to execute after taking a screenshot. The options for `scrot` command can be used for customizing the capture such as setting the area, format, and quality. After the screenshot is taken, the script will be executed. This functionality can be helpful for automating tasks like saving the image with a specific name or sending it through email.
        select: '[AI] `scrot` is a command-line utility for taking screenshots in Linux. The option `--select` allows users to interactively select a rectangular region of the screen to capture using the mouse, rather than specifying fixed coordinates or sizes. Once the selection is made, the image will be saved as a PNG file by default.'
        silent: '[AI] The `scrot` is a screenshot tool for Linux systems. The command `scrot --silent` takes a screenshot silently without displaying any message or progress bar in the terminal window. It''s useful when you want to take a screenshot in the background and don''t need any visual feedback during the process.'
        stack: '[AI] The `scrot` is a command-line screenshot tool for X11 systems. The `--stack` option is used with it to take a screenshot of multiple monitors as if they were stacked on top of each other, resulting in a single image that captures the combined display area. This is especially useful when dealing with multi-monitor setups where applications may span across multiple screens.'
        thumb: '[AI] The `--thumb` option in the `scrot` command is used to take a thumbnail screenshot in addition to the main screenshot. When you run a command like `scrot -s screen.png --thumb thumb.png screen.pdf`, it will create two files: `screen.png` as the full-size screenshot, and `thumb.png` as the thumbnail image. The thumbnail can be used to represent the main screenshot in file managers or image galleries.'
        version: '[AI] `scrot` is a simple and lightweight screenshot tool for X Window System. The command `scrot --version` is used to display the version information of the installed `scrot` software, including the version number, compilation date, and other build-related details. It helps users check if they have the latest version or not, and also provides useful information in case of troubleshooting or reporting bugs.'
