documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh run list` is a GitHubActions command used to list all the scheduled and queued workflow runs for a repository. It can be used to check the status of your workflows and manage them accordingly. The command returns a JSON response containing details such as the ID, status, created and started times, and branch or commit ref for each run.'
    flag:
        branch: '[AI] The `gh run list --branch` command is used in GitHubActions to list all the workflows and their corresponding runs that match a specific branch in a repository. It''s part of the GitHub CLI (gh) tool, specifically its `run` sub-command. Running this command displays the ID, status, and other details of each workflow run on the specified branch. This information can be helpful for debugging or monitoring the progression of workflows across different branches in a GitHub project.'
        commit: '[AI] `gh run list --commit` is a GitHubActions command used to list all workflow runs for a specific commit in a repository. It returns a JSON-formatted response containing details about each workflow run, such as its ID, status, and start and end times. This command can be helpful in understanding the history of workflow executions for a particular commit, allowing for easier debugging or analysis of CI/CD pipeline activity.'
        created: '[AI] `gh run list --created` is a GitHubActions command used to list all workflows runs that were created, but not yet started or finished. This command returns a JSON object containing an array of runs with their respective IDs and other details such as the status, created at, and updated at timestamps. It''s often used for managing and monitoring ongoing workflow executions in GitHubActions.'
        event: '[AI] `gh run list --event` is a GitHubActions command used to list all workflows runs that were triggered by an event in GitHub, such as a push or pull request. The `--event` flag filters the output to only show runs associated with that specific event type. This can be useful for troubleshooting and monitoring workflow executions.'
        jq: '[AI] `gh run list --jq` is a command used with GitHubActions, specifically in the Git Hub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool called `gh`. This command lists all the runs of a workflow in a repository and filters the output using `jq`, a lightweight and flexible open-source data processing tool. The `--jq` flag is used to pass a `jq` query as an argument, which processes and filters the JSON output generated by the `gh run list` command according to the defined rules in the query. This way, you can extract specific information from the raw JSON output of the GitHubActions runs.'
        json: '[AI] `gh run list --json` is a GitHubActions command used to list all workflow runs for a repository in JSON format. This command can be used to retrieve detailed information about each workflow run, including its ID, status, creation time, and other metadata. The `--json` option ensures the output is returned as a JSON object rather than in human-readable format.'
        limit: '[AI] `gh run list --limit` is a GitHub Action command used to list all workflow runs for a repository with a specified limit on the number of results returned. The `--limit` option sets an upper limit on the number of runs displayed, allowing you to view a specific subset of your workflow history. It helps in managing and filtering large numbers of runs, making it easier to focus on recent or relevant executions.'
        status: '[AI] The `gh run list --status` command is used in GitHubActions to list all workflow runs for a specific branch or repository, and displays their current status (e.g., queued, running, completed, or failed). It''s a way to quickly check the latest state of your GitHub Actions workflows without having to navigate through each individual run page in the GitHub web interface.'
        template: '[AI] `gh run list --template` is a command used in GitHubActions, specifically the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool called gh. This command lists all the workflow runs that match a given template. The `--template` option specifies the name or path to an existing workflow file or key in a YAML format. Using this command helps to manage and monitor the execution of GitHubActions across multiple branches, forks, or repositories.'
        user: '[AI] `gh run list --user` is a command used in GitHubActions, specifically with the GitHub CLI (gh), to list all workflows and jobs for the authenticated user''s repositories. This command doesn''t filter by any specific branch or event; it simply returns information about existing workflows, their runs, and associated jobs.'
        workflow: '[AI] The `gh run list --workflow` command is a GitHub Action CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to list all the workflow runs for a specific GitHub repository workflow file. The workflow file defines automation tasks for the repository using YAML syntax. This command returns information about each run including its id, status, created and completed at timestamps, and the event that triggered it. It helps in monitoring and managing the executions of GitHub Actions for a specific workflow file.'
