    command: |-
        [AI] `groupadd` is a Linux command used to create a new group in the system. It adds an entry for the specified group in the /etc/group file and adjusts other related files as needed, such as /etc/gshadow and /etc/passwd. The syntax is:

        ```
        groupadd [OPTION]... GROUP
        ```

        Where `GROUP` is the name of the new group to be created. Optionally, you can use `-g`, followed by a GID number (instead of or in addition to the group name) to assign a specific Group ID (GID). This command needs superuser (root) privileges to execute.
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `groupadd` is a command-line utility used in Unix and Linux systems to create new groups. The `--force` option is an argument that can be passed with this command. It allows creating a group even if it already exists, overwriting the existing group settings instead. This option can be useful when you want to modify or update an existing group''s attributes. Without the `--force` option, attempting to create a group that already exists would result in an error message.'
        gid: '[AI] `groupadd` is a command used in Linux and Unix-like operating systems for creating new groups. The `--gid` option specifies the GID (Group ID) number to assign to the new group. This option allows you to create a group with a specific ID, which can be useful for managing permissions and access control for a set of users. When you run `groupadd --gid <GID> <GroupName>`, the system creates a new group with the given name and the specified GID number.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `groupadd` is a command in Linux and Unix-based systems used to create new system groups. The option `--help` displays the detailed help or usage information for this command. Here's a brief summary:

            ```bash
            Usage: groupadd [OPTION]... GROUP

            Create a new group.  With no option, the group is created with GID equal to the lowest available number greater than any currently existing group.

            Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatorily supplied.

            --gid GID      Create group with specified GID instead of automatically assigning.
            --force        Create group even if it already exists (does nothing if the group name is a system group).
            --help         Display this help and exit.
            --no-create     Don't create the group, just output what would be created.
            --system        Create a system group instead of a user group.
            ```

            This command allows you to specify options like `--gid` for creating a group with a specific GID or `--system` to create a system group. The `--help` option displays this usage information.
        key: '[AI] The `groupadd` command is a utility in Unix and Linux systems used to create new groups with a specified group name and GID (Group ID). The option `--key` is not a valid option for this command in standard implementations like GNU `groupadd`. If you meant to ask about other Unix or Linux commands or utilities, please specify which one.'
        non-unique: '[AI] `groupadd --non-unique` is a command used in Unix-based systems to create a new group with the given name without checking if the group name is already existed with the same GID (Group ID). By default, Unix systems don''t allow creating a group with an existing GID. The `--non-unique` option overrides this behavior and allows you to create a group regardless of the existing GID. This command also automatically adds the group to the /etc/group file, as well as updates the group database (/etc/gshadow) if necessary.'
        password: '[AI] `groupadd` is a Linux command used to create new system groups. The `--password` option is an argument provided with this command to create a new group with a specified password. This password will be used for users who want to join the group using the `usermod -aG <groupname> <username>` command and provide the group''s password during the process. Note that storing group passwords in plain text is not recommended, as it presents security risks. Instead, consider utilizing other methods like NFSv4 or LDAP to manage user access to shared resources.'
        prefix: '[AI] `groupadd` is a Linux command used to create new groups in the system. The option `--prefix=PREFIX` sets a prefix for the group name. This means that the specified string will be added as a prefix to the actual group name while creating it. For example, if you use `--prefix=my_`, then creating a group named "newgroup" would result in the creation of a group called "my\_newgroup" instead.'
        root: '[AI] `groupadd` is a Linux utility command used to create new system groups. The option `--root` specifies the root directory for the group, which by default is set to /. In other words, when using `groupadd --root <path>`, you''re creating a new group with the specified name, but with a different root directory (other than /) for the group''s files and directories. This is useful in specific use cases where multiple systems or partitions have separate groups with shared names, requiring distinct file hierarchies.'
        system: '[AI] `groupadd` is a command-line utility in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems used to create new system groups. The `--system` option specifies that a new system group, as opposed to a user group, is being created. System groups are typically used for managing access permissions for system services and resources. When you run `groupadd --system <groupname>`, it creates a new group with the given name in the system''s /etc/group file, sets up the corresponding entry in the /etc/passwd file (which stores information about users and groups), and updates the group database files (usually represented by the /var/lib/db/group file). This command should be used with root privileges.'
