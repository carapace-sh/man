        closed: '[AI] The command `brew search --closed` is a function provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux.

        debug: |-
            [AI] `brew search --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is not typically used for regular usage as it primarily serves debugging purposes.

            When you run `brew search --debug`, Homebrew will execute a detailed search query in the background and print out extensive debug information about the search process. This includes details such as which indices are being searched, what queries are being used, and any errors or warnings that might occur during the search process.

            The output can help you understand how Homebrew searches for packages and troubleshoot issues related to package discovery and installation. If you're experiencing difficulties with Homebrew, this command might be helpful in identifying the root cause of the problem. However, keep in mind that the debug information can be quite verbose and may not be necessary for most users.
        desc: '[AI] `brew search --desc` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS.
