documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pulumi watch` is a command provided by Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform, that enables real-time updates and observation of changes to your cloud resources or local state. It continuously checks for modifications in your Pulumi stack configuration files and applies the changes to your infrastructure immediately. This can be helpful during development when making frequent updates to your infrastructure definitions. Keep in mind, it may incur costs in production environments as each change is applied directly without the ability to review or approve changes before deployment.'
