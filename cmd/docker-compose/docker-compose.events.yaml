documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker-compose events` is a command used with Docker Compose to display real-time events from the specified services as they occur. It provides insights into the running containers, such as container creation, start, stop, and error messages. This can be useful for monitoring application logs or debugging issues in complex multi-container applications.'
    flag:
        json: '[AI] `docker-compose events --json` is a command used with Docker Compose to monitor and collect real-time events from services in a Compose file in JSON format. This allows for easier processing and analysis of the data by external systems or tools that can handle JSON input. By default, it shows only the container-specific events; to view all events (including network, image, etc.), add `--scope global`. Events include things like container creation, start, stop, restart, and error occurrences.'
