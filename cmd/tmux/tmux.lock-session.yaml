    command: '[AI] The `tmux lock-session` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to add a password-protected session lock. Once locked, no one can attach or reattach to the session without providing the correct password. This feature is helpful when you want to ensure that no unauthorized users can access your running applications or terminal sessions while you are away from your machine.'
    flag:
        t: '[AI] `tmux lock-session` is a command in the tmux terminal multiplexer software. The `-t` option specifies the target session name or ID. This command locks the specified tmux session, preventing it from being detached or killed accidentally. When you run this command, tmux will ask for your password to authenticate and then the session will be locked, keeping its processes running and preserving the terminal layout even if the client that started the session is disconnected.'
