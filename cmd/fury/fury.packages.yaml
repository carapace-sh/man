    command: '[AI] "Fury Packages" is not a recognized command in any commonly used programming or operating system environment. It seems to be specific to Fury, an open-source build tool for Elixir and Erlang projects. With Fury, you can define your application''s dependencies and execute tasks like fetching, compiling, and releasing packages from Hex (Elixir/Erlang package repository) or Git. To manage dependencies with Fury, create a `mix.exs` file in the root directory of your project and add `defp deps do ... end` inside it. Inside the do block, list your dependencies using hex: or git: followed by the package name and version. After making changes to the dependencies, run `fury deps get` to install the updated packages.'
