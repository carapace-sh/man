    -t, --timeout=: Specify a shutdown timeout in seconds
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker-compose restart` is a command used to restart services defined in a Docker Compose file. It signals the container to gracefully stop, then starts a new container instance for each service. This can be useful when you want to apply changes made to the configuration of the services or when services are not responding.'
    flag:
        no-deps: '[AI] `docker-compose restart --no-deps` is a command used to restart services defined in a Docker Compose file. The `--no-deps` flag indicates that only the specified services should be restarted and not their dependencies. This means that the dependent services will remain running, potentially avoiding unnecessary downtime during service restarts.'
        timeout: '[AI] `docker-compose restart --timeout` is a command used to restart services defined in a Docker Compose file. The `--restart` flag triggers this action, while `--timeout` sets the maximum amount of time (in seconds) Docker should wait for each container to be rebuilt or started before considering it failed and moving on to the next service. If no containers can be restarted within the given timeout, Docker Compose will exit with an error. This command is helpful when dealing with services that may take longer than usual to start or recover from an error.'
