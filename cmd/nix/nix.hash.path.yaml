documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command is a utility in Nix packaging system used to compute cryptographic hashes (SHA1, SHA256, etc.) of files or directories. Given a file path or directory as an argument, it outputs the hash value in hexadecimal format, providing a means to verify the integrity of files or packages within the Nix ecosystem.'
    flag:
        base16: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command with the `--base16` option generates a Base16 (hexadecimal) hash representation of a file''s content or a build output in Nix packaging systems. This hash is calculated using a secure hashing algorithm, and its hexadecimal format makes it easy to compare and include in configuration files or other contexts where space and readability are important. The resulting string represents the unique digital fingerprint of the file or output being hashed.'
        base32: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command with the `--base32` option generates a Base32 checksum of a file or a directory in the Nix Package Manager. A checksum is a fixed-size string of characters that uniquely identifies the data it was computed from. In this case, Nix computes the hash using a specific algorithm (likely SHA-256 or SHA-3) and then converts the resulting bitstring to Base32 format for easier handling and display. This is commonly used in Nix for reproducible build systems and package verification.'
        base64: |-
            [AI] The `nix-hash` command is a utility from Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. The `--base64` option is used to output hashes in base64 encoding instead of the default hexadecimal format.

            When you run `nix-hash <file> --base64`, it computes the cryptographic hash (using SHA-256 by default) of the specified file and prints the result as a base64-encoded string. This can be useful when dealing with hashes in environments where hexadecimal is not convenient, such as command-line scripts or APIs that expect base64-encoded data.
        debug: |-
            [AI] `nix-hash` is a command-line utility provided by Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The command `nix hash path --debug` is used to compute the cryptographic hash of a file or a directory in Nix expression language with debug mode enabled.

            With this command:

            1. Replace `path` with the actual file or directory path you want to compute the hash for.
            2. The `--debug` flag enables the generation of additional debugging information, which can be helpful when troubleshooting Nix expressions or understanding the underlying hashing process.
            3. The command will then output both the computed hash and any associated debug data, helping developers gain a deeper understanding of how Nix is handling file hashes in their environment.
        log-format: |-
            [AI] The `nix-hash` command is a tool from Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. The option `--log-format` specifies the format of the output log generated when running `nix-hash`. The default log format is "short", which displays hashes in SHA-256 format preceded by their file paths. However, you can customize the log format using various placeholders, such as:

            * "%h": Hash value in hexadecimal
            * "%s": File path
            * "%t": Timestamp of last modification
            * "%z": Compressed size of the file

            For example, `--log-format='%h %s'` will display only the hash value and file path.
        print-build-logs: '[AI] The `nix-build` or `nix-build-env` command with the option `--print-build-logs` generates and prints the file paths of the build logs for a specific Nix expression. Build logs contain detailed information about the build process, including outputs from configure scripts, compilation messages, and error reports. These logs can be helpful in debugging build issues or understanding the build process in more detail.'
        quiet: '[AI] The command `nix-hash` with the flag `--quiet` is used in Nix Package Manager for generating and printing only the cryptographic hash value of a file or a build output without any additional messages or verbose output. This can be useful when integrating this operation into scripts or continuous integration systems where you only care about the hash value and not the detailed output from the command.'
        sri: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command with the `--sri` option generates a SHA-256 checksum for a file and outputs its Size, Range (size in bytes), and Checksum in base64-encoded format as a Nix expression string. This string can be used to specify the expected checksum of a file in a Nix configuration or build process. The resulting string is sometimes referred to as the "Store checksum record" or "SRIs" (Secure Resolver Identifiers).'
        type: |-
            [AI] The `nix-hash` command is a tool from the Nix Package Manager used to compute and print file hashes in various formats, ensuring data integrity and reproducibility. The `--type` option specifies the desired hash type:

            1. `sha2` or `sha256`: SHA-256 (256-bit) hash, which is commonly used due to its security and widespread adoption.
            2. `sha3` or `sha3x`: SHA-3 family of hashes (SHA-384, SHA-512, etc.), offering improved security over SHA-2.
            3. `md5`: MD5 (128-bit) hash, an older and less secure hash function compared to modern alternatives like SHA-2 or SHA-3.

            The complete command with the given explanation could be written as:
            ```css
            nix-hash --type sha2 <file_path>
            ```
            or
            ```css
            nix-hash --type md5 <file_path>
            ```
            and so on for other hash types.
        verbose: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command with the `--verbose` option is used to compute and display SHA-256 checksums for Nix expressions or packages. When run with `--verbose`, it prints detailed information about each step of the build process, including the file paths being processed and their corresponding hash values. This can be useful for verifying the integrity of downloaded Nix packages or for debugging build issues.'
