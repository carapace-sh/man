documentation:
    command: '[AI] `alsamixer` is a graphical console-based application for mixing and configuring sound card settings using the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). It allows users to adjust volume levels, mute channels, change input sources, and perform other audio configuration tasks in real-time. It''s popularly used for fine-tuning audio settings in Linux systems, especially when dealing with hardware issues or complex sound configurations.'
    flag:
        abstraction: '[AI] `alsamixer --abstraction` is a command-line utility used in Linux for managing sound card settings with the Alsa Sound Library. The `--abstraction` option is specifically used to display and manipulate abstract (or virtual) mixer elements, which are software-defined audio channels or controls that don''t correspond to physical hardware mixer channels. These abstract mixers can be created and configured by applications for customizing sound output in various scenarios.'
        card: '[AI] `alsamixer` is a graphical mixer application for ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture). The command `alsamixer --card <card-number>` specifies which ALSA sound card to use when running the `alsamixer` application. Replace `<card-number>` with the number of the desired sound card, typically ranging from 0 to n where n represents the total number of cards available on the system. This command helps in managing audio settings for specific sound cards.'
        config: '[AI] `alsamixer` is a graphical mixer application for the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). The command `alsamixer --config` opens the ALSA mixer configuration file in a text editor, allowing users to edit and customize various settings related to sound output devices, such as volume controls, mute options, and other device-specific configurations. This can be useful for fine-tuning audio settings or addressing specific sound issues on Linux systems.'
        device: '[AI] `alsamixer` is a graphical mixer application for the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) used to configure sound settings on Linux systems. The command `alsamixer --device <device_name>` is used to open the graphical interface specifically for the named sound device. For example, `alsamixer --device plughw:0,0` would open the mixer for the first PCI sound card. This command allows users to adjust volume levels, mute channels, and set other audio options for that particular device.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `alsamixer` is a text-based graphical interface for mixing and configuring sound card settings using the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). The command `alsamixer --help` displays the help information for this utility, providing an overview of its features and usage.

            Here's a summary of what you can find in the help output:

            1. Synopsis: A brief explanation of how to use alsamixer with various options.
            2. Description: An introduction to alsamixer's purpose and capabilities.
            3. Options: Detailed explanations of various options, such as --no-split, --no-gap, and others that can be used when running the command.
            4. Keymap: A description of available keys and their functions while using alsamixer.
            5. Examples: Simple usage examples for different scenarios.
            6. Bugs and Contact Information: Where to report bugs or get in touch with the developers.
        mouse: '[AI] `alsamixer --mouse` is a command used in Linux to open the Alsa Mixer graphical user interface with mouse support enabled. The Alsamixer is a tool for configuring sound card settings, and the `--mouse` option allows users to interact with it more efficiently by using the mouse to control volume levels and other mixer channels instead of the default keyboard shortcuts.'
        no-color: '[AI] `alsamixer` is a graphical mixer application for the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). The command `alsamixer --no-color` disables the color feature of the application. This means that the interface will be displayed in shades of gray instead of using colors to represent different elements, potentially making it more accessible or easier on the eyes for some users.'
        no-config: '[AI] `alsamixer` is a graphical interface for configuring sound card settings using the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). The command `alsamixer --no-config` is used to open `alsamixer` without loading any previously saved configuration files. In other words, it opens with default settings.'
        no-mouse: '[AI] `alsamixer` is a graphical mixing console for the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) sound system in Linux. The command `alsamixer --no-mouse` is used to open the mixer interface without enabling the mouse mode. In mouse mode, users can adjust volume levels and mute channels by clicking on them, whereas in textual mode, these actions are performed using keyboard shortcuts. The `--no-mouse` option disables mouse functionality when opening the application, making it suitable for scripts or automated processes where only keyboard input is required.'
        view: '[AI] `alsamixer --view` is a command used in Linux to open the ALSA Mixer application with a specific window layout or view. The `--view` option specifies which predefined layout to use, allowing users to customize their mixer interface according to their preferences. This command is commonly used by audio enthusiasts and Linux system administrators for fine-tuning audio settings.'
