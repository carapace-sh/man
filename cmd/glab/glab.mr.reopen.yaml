description: Reopen merge requests
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `glab mr reopen` command is used in GitLab to reopen a Merge Request (MR). When an MR is closed, it signifies that developers have reviewed and made necessary changes to address any feedback or issues raised during the review process. However, if there are additional modifications needed, the MR can be reopened for further work. Running `glab mr reopen` in your terminal or command line interface will open the previously closed MR with an editable state, allowing you to make new changes and submit them for review once more.'
