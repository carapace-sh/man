    command: '[AI] The `gh codespace ports` command is used in the GitHub Codespaces product to list the public ports exposed for a specific codespace instance. The output will display each port number and its corresponding protocol (TCP or UDP). This command helps developers access external services or tools that require connecting to ports during their coding sessions within GitHub Codespaces.'
    flag:
        jq: '[AI] `gh codespace ports --jq` is a command used with GitHub''s gh CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. This command creates or updates a GitHub CodeSpace, which is a lightweight development environment for working on GitHub repositories, and then uses `jq`, a powerful JSON processor, to query and filter the output of the CodeSpace''s list of open ports. The result is a JSON object containing information about each open port, such as its name, protocol, and public URL.'
        json: '[AI] The `gh codespace ports --json` command is used with the GitHub CLI (gh) to create or list ports for a GitHub CodeSpace, which is an isolated development environment provided by GitHub for building and testing code. The `--json` flag requests that the output be returned in JSON format, allowing easier processing of the data by scripts or other applications. This command creates a new port if specified parameters are provided, or lists existing ports and their details if no arguments are given.'
        template: '[AI] `gh codespace ports --template` is a command used with the GitHub CLI (gh) to create or update an inferred Kubernetes YAML manifest for a GitHub Codespace with custom ports exposed. The `--template` flag specifies a file containing Mustache templates to define the desired configuration. When run, gh creates or updates the corresponding YAML file according to the provided template.'
