documentation:
    command: '[AI] `circleci context create` is a command used in CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform. This command creates a new context, which is essentially a named collection of CircleCI configuration settings, such as projects, branches, and environment variables. The new context can be activated to apply these configurations to specific CircleCI jobs or workflows. This helps to keep the CircleCI configuration organized and reusable across different use cases.'
