description: Remove build cache
flags:
    --filter=: Provide filter values (e.g. "until=24h")
    --keep-storage=: Amount of disk space to keep for cache
    -a, --all: Remove all unused build cache, not just dangling ones
    -f, --force: Do not prompt for confirmation
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker builder prune` is a Docker CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to remove unused and intermediate images created during Dockerfile build processes. It helps in managing the disk space by cleaning up unnecessary build artifacts, keeping only the final images that will be used for running containers.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `docker builder prune --all` is a command used in Docker to remove unused and intermediate images created during Dockerfile build processes. The `--all` flag indicates that all unused images from all builds should be deleted, not just the most recent ones. This can help keep your Docker environment clean and efficient by reducing the amount of disk space used by unnecessary images.'
        filter: '[AI] `docker builder prune --filter` is a command used to remove unused Docker build cache and images that are not part of any built image. The `--filter` option allows specifying filters to control which images and caches get deleted. For example, `--filter "dangling=true"` will only delete dangling (unreferenced) images or `--filter="until=<image>"` will keep all images up until the specified image. By default, it deletes all unused build cache and images.'
        force: '[AI] `docker builder prune --force` is a command used in Docker to remove intermediate image build artifacts that are no longer needed. This can help save disk space as these intermediate images are not meant to be used as running containers and can add up quickly in large builds. The `--force` flag forces the removal of these images without asking for confirmation, making it an aggressive cleaning action.'
        keep-storage: '[AI] The `docker builder prune --keep-storage` command is used to remove unused Docker build cache and images that are not part of any Docker image or container in your system. This helps to save disk space. However, it keeps the storage used by the `$DOCKER_BUILDKIT_CACHE` environment variable. In other words, it cleans up all but the most recent build cache, while keeping the build cache that is currently being used for ongoing Docker builds.'
