documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubectl set` is a sub-command used in Kubernetes for updating the values of specific fields within existing Kubernetes objects, such as ConfigMaps, Secrets, or YAML manifests. It allows you to modify parts of your Kubernetes resources without changing the entire configuration file. For example, `kubectl set key/value --file mymanifest.yaml` updates the value associated with ''key'' in the ''mymanifest.yaml'' file. This command is particularly useful when making small changes to resources without having to rewrite or recreate the whole manifest.'
