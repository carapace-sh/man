documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `newrelic entity tags replace` command is used in New Relic''s Command Line Interface (CLI) to update or replace existing entity tags for a specific entity, such as an application or a browser monitor, within the New Relic platform. This command allows users to modify or update the associated tags, making it easier to organize and filter their entities based on specific criteria. The command takes the form of `newrelic entities update <entity_type> <entity_id> --tag-list <new_tags>`, where `<entity_type>` is the type of entity (e.g., app or browser), `<entity_id>` is the unique identifier for the entity, and `<new_tags>` are the new tags to be applied, separated by commas.'
    flag:
        guid: '[AI] The `newrelic entity tags replace --guid` flag is used in the New Relic API to update existing entity tags with a new GUID (Globally Unique Identifier). When this command is executed, any previously assigned tags for the specified entity will be replaced with the new set of tags identified by the provided GUIDs. This action can be useful for managing and updating the tagging of various resources within New Relic, such as applications or hosts.'
        tag: '[AI] The `--tag replace` option in the New Relic Entity Tags command is used to update existing tags on entities with new values, effectively replacing the previous tags. This allows for dynamic tag management where tags can be updated as needed. For instance, this could be useful in automating or updating application environment tags based on deployment changes or other events. The `--tag` argument specifies the specific tag key to update.'
