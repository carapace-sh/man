documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "tea open" is not a standard command in any widely-used operating system or software application. It seems to be specific to the TEA (Tiny Emacs Alike) text editor, which is a lightweight alternative to Emacs. In TEA, this command is used to open a new file for editing in a split window or a tab, depending on your configuration. The exact behavior may depend on the user''s setup and preferences.'
    flag:
        login: '[AI] The `--login` flag used with the `tea open` command in the Tea interface for Kubernetes is used to indicate that a new terminal session should be created and that the user should be authenticated using SSH keys before the container is started. This flag is particularly useful when accessing interactive applications running inside Kubernetes clusters, ensuring secure access with minimal manual intervention.'
        remote: '[AI] The `--remote` option in the `tea open` command is used with the TEA (Tree Exploration Arborist) tool for Git repositories. When you run `tea open --remote <repository>`, it sets up TEA to connect and work with a remote Git repository, instead of a local one. This allows you to explore, navigate, and search through the Git history of the remote repository as if it was a local one, but with all the changes and commits applied in real-time. It''s particularly useful for large or remote repositories where working locally might not be practical.'
        repo: '[AI] The `tea open` command with the `--repo` option is used in the TeaDB database tool to open an existing repository. This command loads metadata and data files from a specified directory or URL into the local TeaDB environment, allowing users to access and manipulate the data stored within that repository.'
