    command: '[AI] `git verify-pack` is a Git command used to validate the integrity of a pack file, which is a compressed archive containing multiple Git objects. The command reads the pack file and checks its internal data structures and signatures to ensure they are correct and have not been tampered with. This command can be useful for ensuring the security and reliability of Git repositories that are being shared or transferred between systems.'
    flag:
        stat-only: '[AI] `git verify-pack --stat-only` is a Git command used to validate the integrity of a pack file, which is a compressed repository format used for transferring large repositories over the network or for creating local backups. This specific command produces only a statistics output indicating which objects within the pack have been modified since the last pack creation. It doesn''t actually update or modify any data but instead provides information about potential changes.'
        verbose: '[AI] `git verify-pack --verbose` is a Git command used to validate the integrity of a pack file, which is a compressed archive containing multiple Git commits or objects. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output displayed during the verification process, providing more detailed information about the data being checked. This command helps ensure the authenticity and completeness of the packed data before importing it into a local or remote repository.'
