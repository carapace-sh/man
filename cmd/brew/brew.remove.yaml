After running this command, Homebrew will remove the associated files and directories for the specified Cask application from your system.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew remove --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to remove an installed software package along with its dependencies and leaves behind a debug file, which can be helpful for troubleshooting or understanding why a package was removed. The debug file contains detailed information about the removal process, including any errors or warnings that might have occurred.'
        force: '[AI] `brew remove --force` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to uninstall or remove a previously installed Homebrew package or formula, ignoring any dependency conflicts and keeping forcefully overwriting files if needed. The `--force` option allows the removal of packages even if they have unsatisfied dependencies or leave important files behind, which could lead to potential issues in the system. It is recommended to use this command with caution.'
        formula: '[AI] `brew remove --formula` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to uninstall Homebrew-managed packages or formulas from your system.
