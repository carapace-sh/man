flags:
    --help: display this help and exit
    --suffix=: append SUFF to TEMPLATE
    --version: output version information and exit
    -d, --directory: create a directory, not a file
    -p, --tmpdir?: interpret TEMPLATE relative to DIR

    -u, --dry-run: do not create anything; merely print a name (unsafe)
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `mktemp` is a utility command in Unix-like operating systems, used to generate unique temporary file names. It creates one or more named templates and expands them with a unique suffix, ensuring that the resulting filenames are not clashes with existing files in the directory. This command helps maintain file uniqueness when creating temporary files, making it useful for scripts and other automated processes.'
    flag:
        directory: '[AI] `mktemp --directory` is a command from the GNU `coreutils` package, used to create unique temporary directories in Unix-like systems. The option `--directory` indicates that it should create an empty directory instead of a regular file with a unique prefix and suffix. This is particularly useful when you need a new, isolated directory for temporary data during a script execution.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `mktemp --d dry-run` is a command from the GNU `mktemp` utility, used to create unique temporary file names. The `--dry-run` option is used in testing mode, simulating the creation of files without actually creating them. In other words, it prints the generated file name(s) to the standard output stream without writing any data to a file.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `mktemp` is a utility in Unix-like operating systems for creating unique temporary files or directories with a given prefix and suffix. The command `mktemp --help` displays the brief help message for this tool, providing an overview of its usage and available options:

            * It creates new unique files or directories using the provided template.
            * Optionally, it can delete the created file(s) after use (using the `-t` option followed by a temporary directory).
            * You can specify patterns for the file/directory names using placeholders (e.g., '%s' or '%t') in the template.
            * Additional options include creating only directories with the `--directory` flag, or setting the output character set with the `--no-perms` option.

            For more detailed information on specific options and usage examples, refer to the man page (`man mktemp`) provided by your system.
        quiet: '[AI] `mktemp --quiet` is a command from the GNU Coreutils library used to create unique temporary files or directories in Unix-like systems. The `--quiet` option suppresses the output of the command, meaning it does not print the created file or directory names. Instead, it only returns an empty status if successful and sets the file descriptor if a temp file is created. This can be useful for scripts that do not require the output of the command but need to ensure a unique temporary file exists.'
        suffix: '[AI] `mktemp --suffix` is a command in Unix-like operating systems, specifically part of the GNU Core Utilities. This option generates unique file names as arguments, with a given suffix appended to the base name. For instance, if you use `mktemp foo.txt`, it will create a new file with a name like `foo.txt.XXXXXX`. The suffix `.XXXXXX` is replaced with a random string of six letters and digits, making each generated filename unique. This command is often used when creating temporary files to ensure that they don''t overwrite existing ones.'
        t: '[AI] `mktemp` is a utility command in Unix-like operating systems for creating unique temporary files or directories. The `-t` option is used to specify a template for naming the output file. It creates a file with a name based on that template, adding random suffixes to ensure uniqueness. For example, `mktemp tempfile.txt.XXXXXX` will create a file named `tempfile.txt.XXXXXX` where XXXXXX is a randomly generated string.'
        tmpdir: '[AI] `mktemp --tmpdir` is a command from the GNU Coreutils suite used to create unique temporary files or directories with a specified prefix and suffix. The `--tmpdir` option tells it to create the file or directory in a system-specific or user-defined temporary directory instead of the current one, reducing the risk of overwriting existing files by mistake. This improves safety when working with temporary data in scripting or development environments.'
        version: '[AI] `mktemp --version` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to create unique temporary files or directories with valid names. The `--version` option is used to display the version information of the mktemp utility itself, providing details such as the version number, compilation time, and other relevant information.'
