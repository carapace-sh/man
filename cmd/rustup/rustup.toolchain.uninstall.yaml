            [AI] `rustup toolchain uninstall` is a Rust programming language command used to remove a specific Rust toolchain installation from your system. The `--help` flag provides detailed information about how to use this command effectively. Here's a brief explanation:

            Usage: `rustup toolchain uninstall <NAME>`

            Flags:
            - `--global`: Uninstalls the global toolchain (default is local)
            - `--force`: Deletes associated lockfiles and other configuration files

            Description:
            Removes the specified Rust toolchain from your system. By default, it removes only the toolchain itself; to remove associated lockfiles and other configuration files, use the `--force` flag. The `<NAME>` argument specifies the name or the hash of the toolchain to be uninstalled.

            Examples:
            1. To uninstall a local toolchain named 'stable': `rustup toolchain uninstall stable`
            2. To uninstall the global toolchain: `rustup toolchain uninstall --global`
            3. To force-remove a local toolchain with associated files: `rustup toolchain uninstall mytoolchain --force`
