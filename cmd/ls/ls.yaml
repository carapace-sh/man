documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `ls` command is a basic file listing utility in Unix-like operating systems. It lists the files and directories in the current directory in various formats, such as long format (detailed information including permissions, links, ownership, size, and modification time), or short format (just filenames). By default, it only shows files, not hidden directories. Additional options can be used to modify its behavior, like `-a` to show hidden files, or `-l` for a detailed listing.'
    flag:
        "1": '[AI] The command `ls -1` is a Unix or Linux terminal command used to list files and directories in the current directory with one item per line format. The `-1` option is also known as the "--one-file-per-line" option, which instructs the `ls` command to display each file or directory name on a separate line.'
        C: '[AI] The `ls -C` command in Unix or Linux lists the contents of a directory in a columnar format with an indentation showing the hierarchy. Each output line begins with a character representing the type of file: `-` for regular files, `D` for directories, `@` for symbolic links, and so on. This format makes it easier to see the hierarchy and relationships between files and directories within a directory.'
        S: '[AI] The `ls -S` command in Unix or Linux lists the files in a directory with the largest files first, shown by their file size. The `-l` option provides a detailed listing format, while `-S` sorts the output by file size in descending order.'
        U: '[AI] The `ls -U` command is a Unix or Linux terminal command used to list directory contents with the latest modification time first, displayed as a sortable column. The `-U` option stands for "unsorted" or "use-time-order," which indicates that files will be listed based on their modification times in reverse order (newest first). However, it also means that the output is not sorted by columns other than the time column. This can result in a mixed listing of files and directories. If you want to sort by multiple columns, consider using `-t` for time and another sorting option such as `-l` or `-1` for detailed listings.'
        X: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `-X` option is used in Unix or Linux systems to list the contents of a directory showing only the files and directories that have not been modified since the last mount of the file system. It does not display hidden files by default, but it can be combined with other options such as `-a` if needed. So, `ls -X` lists files with the most recent modification time on the file system.'
        all: '[AI] The command `ls --all` in Unix-based systems is used to list the contents of a directory with the option `--all` or `-a` which stands for "all" or "archive." This option makes the listing include hidden files and directories, which typically begin with a dot (`.`). Without this option, hidden files are not displayed when using the regular `ls` command.'
        almost-all: |-
            [AI] The `ls --almost-all` command is a combination of the `ls` (list) command and the `--all` or `-a` option in Unix/Linux file systems.

            The `ls` command by default lists out the files and directories present in the current directory. With the addition of `--almost-all`, it displays all files including hidden ones (files with names starting with a dot) but excludes the system files and directories (like . and ..). This is useful when you want to list all visible files and hidden files without system files cluttering the output.
        author: '[AI] The `ls --author` command is a Linux terminal command used to list files in a directory with their respective authors. This command is an extension of the standard `ls` (list) command, which by default only displays file names. When used with the `--author` option, `ls` will display each file''s name followed by its author or owner. The author information is typically obtained from the file''s metadata, specifically the ''uid'' field in the inode structure of the file system.'
        block-size: '[AI] The `ls --block-size` command is used in Unix-like operating systems to list files with their size displayed in blocks instead of bytes. A block is a grouping of binary data and can vary between file systems. By default, the size is displayed in 1 KB units, but it can be changed by specifying a suffix such as `--block-size=5M` for 5 megabytes. This option is useful when working with large files or directories where file sizes are more easily understood in larger units.'
        c: |-
            [AI] The `ls` command with the `-c` option in Unix or Linux lists the contents of a directory in a continuous format, displaying each file's first character as a representation of its file type. For example:

            ```bash
            - : regular file
            d : directory
            dr : directory (with subdirectories)
            l : symbolic link
            s : socket
            p : named pipe (FIFO)
            c : character device
            b : block device
            ```

            By using this option, you can quickly identify the types of files in a directory and distinguish them from one another. This can be useful for understanding the structure of a file system or for finding specific types of files within a large directory tree.
        classify: '[AI] `ls --classify` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems, specifically with the `ls` utility. This option displays files with indicators for their type: - `/` for directories, `*` for regular files, `@` for symbolic links, `%` for executable files, and `|` for sockets or pipes. The output also includes file permissions and ownership information.'
        color: '[AI] The `ls --color` command is a option in the Linux `ls` utility for listing directory contents with colored labels. It enables the display of file type indicators (e.g., directories in blue, executable files in green) using color in the terminal output. This can make it easier to distinguish different types of files at a glance.'
        context: |-
            [AI] The `ls --context` command is a combination of the `ls` (list) Unix utility and the `--context` option. The primary purpose of using this command is to display file and directory listings with an enhanced format, making it easier to distinguish between directories, files, and symbolic links.

            When you run `ls --context`, the output will be organized into columns with an indention that clearly shows the hierarchical relationship between files and directories. Each level of indentation corresponds to a directory, with the last column showing the file or link name. Directories are represented by square brackets "[ ]", while symbolic links are indicated by an arrow "=>" followed by the target file path.

            This command is particularly useful when working in complex directory structures and dealing with large numbers of files to quickly identify the type and location of a specific file or directory.
        dereference: '[AI] The `--dereference` option in the `ls` command is used to show the contents of symbolic links directly, instead of displaying the link itself. By default, `ls` displays a symbolic link as a file with the name of the linked file or directory followed by an arrow `->`. With `--dereference`, the contents of the symbolic link are displayed as if they were in the location to which the link points. This can be useful for understanding the structure of a directory hierarchy, especially when dealing with multiple levels of symbolic links.'
        dereference-command-line: |-
            [AI] The `--dereference` option in the `ls` command is used to show the content of symbolic links instead of the link names itself. By default, `ls` only displays the symbolic links as special files with a `->` sign and the target file name.

            When using `--dereference`, `ls` will show the content of the symbolic link as if you have navigated into that directory or file. If it's a file, its content is displayed; if it's a directory, the files and directories within are shown. This can be useful when trying to understand the file structure of a system where many symbolic links exist.

            The `--command-line` option is not a valid option for `ls`. If you meant to use `--dereference-ports` or `--dereference-specials`, these options are used in conjunction with other FUSE (Filesystems in Userspace) mount commands to dereference symbolic links when listing the contents of mounted filesystems. In this context, `--dereference-ports` is used for network ports and `--dereference-specials` for special device files.
        dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir: |-
            [AI] The `ls --dereference` command in Linux is used to display the contents of a directory with the specified behavior for symbolic links. The `--dereference` option follows symbolic links and displays the files or directories to which they point instead of the symbols links themselves.

            The `--command-line-symlink-to-dir` option is an extension specific to some file managers and shells, such as Midnight Commander and Bash. It instructs these tools to dereference directory symbolic links on the command line when listing their contents. This means that if you have a symbolic link to a directory in your command line argument (e.g., `ls mydir/linktoDir/`), the output will show files and directories under the actual targeted directory, rather than the symlink itself.
        directory: |-
            [AI] The `ls --directory` command is not a valid flag combination in Unix or Linux file systems when used with the `ls` (list) utility. The correct usage of `ls` to list only directories is `ls -d *dirname*`. Here's an explanation:

            - The `--` option tells `ls` that all following options are to be interpreted by the utility itself, not passed on to some other command as arguments.
            - The `-d` option instructs `ls` to display only the directories (not their contents) and to show each directory as a single entry, with its full path displayed. For example:
              ```
              $ ls -d /path/to/directory/
              /path/to/directory/
              ```
            - If no `dirname` is specified after the `-d`, `ls` will display all directories in the current working directory. For example:
              ```
              $ ls -d
              ./subdir1
              ./subdir2
              .
              ```
        dired: |-
            [AI] The `ls --dired` command is a variation of the standard `ls` (list) command in Unix-like operating systems. The `--dired` option stands for "directory listings, experimental." It displays a columnar listing of files and directories in a directory, with each line representing a single file or directory.

            The output includes additional information such as file permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and modification time. However, its most notable feature is the inclusion of special characters at the beginning of lines for certain types of entries: `/` for directories, `@` for symbolic links, and `|` for executable files.

            This format allows users to perform various operations on multiple files and directories directly from the terminal using simple keyboard shortcuts, making it a powerful tool for navigating and managing directory structures efficiently.
        escape: |-
            [AI] The `ls` command with the `--escape` option is used in Unix-like operating systems to list files and directories with special characters escaped for use in shell scripts or other programs that require literal representation of file names.

            When you run `ls --escape`, it lists all files and directories in the current directory, with any special characters (spaces, tabs, backslashes, etc.) in their names replaced by their corresponding escape sequences (\ space, \t tab, \n newline, etc.). For example:

            ```sh
            $ ls --escape
            dir/  file1.txt  file2 with spaces.txt  file3\ with\ tab.\ tab.txt
            ```

            This output is useful when you want to include filenames with special characters in shell commands or other scripts without having those characters interpreted by the shell before execution.
        f: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `-f` option in Unix and Unix-like operating systems is used to list files and directories in the terminal, with the `-f` flag causing file names to be displayed as they are stored in the underlying file system. This means that symbolic links are displayed as their target files instead of the link names themselves. Additionally, it hides implied dot files (files whose names start with a single dot).'
        file-type: '[AI] The `ls --file-type` command in Unix-based systems is used to list files with indicators of their file types. The `--file-type` option causes `ls` to append a / or \* symbol after each file name, indicating whether it''s a directory (/) or a regular file (*). This helps differentiate between files in the output.'
        format: '[AI] The `--format` option in the `ls` command is used to customize the output format of the listing. It allows you to specify how files and directories should be displayed, including fields such as file name, permissions, owner, group, size, and date. Users can define their own format strings to suit their needs using various placeholders, such as `%p` for the pathname, `%u` for the user, or `%s` for the file size. This option enables fine-grained control over the appearance of the output from the `ls` command.'
        full-time: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `--full-time` option displays the output of file listings with the full timestamp instead of the abbreviated format. This includes the full date and time, including hours, minutes, seconds, and sometimes even fractions of a second. For example, instead of just seeing "Mar 12", you would see "Mar 12 15:30:45".'
        g: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `-g` flag is used in Unix and Linux file systems to display the file permissions in a more readable format called "octal format." In this format, each file or directory is represented by a string of 10 characters. The first character indicates the file type (e.g., ''-'' for regular files, ''d'' for directories), followed by three sets of three digits. These sets represent the permissions for the owner, group, and others, respectively. Each set represents read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions. For example, `rw-r--r--` corresponds to `644`, meaning the file has read permission for the owner, read and write permission for the group, and no permissions for others.'
        group-directories-first: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `--group-directories-first` option changes the default behavior of listing directory contents. Instead of sorting the output by file type (files before directories), this option sorts directories first, followed by files in their respective groups based on file ownership. This can be useful when working with large or complex directory structures to better organize and navigate the output.'
        help: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `--help` option is used to display detailed help information about the `ls` (list) command in Unix or Linux terminal environments. This includes a list of all possible options and their meanings, as well as usage examples and explanations. It''s an effective way for users to quickly learn about what a particular command can do and how it should be used.'
        hide: '[AI] The `ls` command with the option `--hidden` or `-h` in Unix-based systems is used to list the contents of a directory, but with an added feature to hide files that begin with a dot (`.`) in the terminal output. These hidden files are typically configuration or system files. To display hidden files as well, use the option `--all` or `-a` with the `ls` command instead.'
        hide-control-chars: |-
            [AI] The `ls --hide-control-chars` command is a Linux or Unix terminal command used to list directory contents with hidden control characters. When you run `ls` without any options, it displays all files and directories in the current directory along with their file permissions and other metadata. Some of this metadata may include control characters, which are not meant to be human-readable and can appear as strange symbols or codes.

            The `--hide-control-chars` option hides these control characters from the output, making it easier to read and understand. It does this by filtering out any characters in the terminal output that have a codepoint below 32 (ASCII control characters).
        human-readable: '[AI] The `ls --human-readable` command is a combination of the `ls` (list) command with the `--human-readable` option in Linux or Unix file systems. This option, also known as the `--h` flag, changes the way file sizes are displayed in the output. Instead of using bytes, it shows sizes in a human-friendly format, such as KB (kilobytes), MB (megabytes), and GB (gigabytes). It helps users to better understand the size of files and directories they''re working with.'
        hyperlink: '[AI] The `--hyperlink` option is not a valid flag for the `ls` command in Linux or Unix-based systems. There is no such option recognized by the `ls` utility. Instead, you can use other options like `--color=auto`, `--human-readable`, or `--recursive` to display file information in different formats.'
        ignore: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `--ignore` option in Unix-based systems is used to exclude specific files or directories from the output of the `ls` command. The arguments provided after `--ignore` are the patterns to be ignored. For example, `ls --ignore="*.log" *` will list all files except those with a ".log" extension. Multiple patterns can be separated by a space.'
        ignore-backups: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `--ignore-backups` option is used in Unix-based systems to list files and directories, excluding files with backup suffixes such as `.~`, `.bak`, `.old`, etc., from the output. This helps keep the output cleaner by hiding unnecessary backup files while listing the contents of a directory.'
        indicator-style: |-
            [AI] The `--indicator-style` option in the `ls` command is used to change the type of indicators displayed for different file types in a directory listing. The default indicator style is a single point (`.`) for regular files and a double point (`..`) for directories.

            With the `--indicator-style` option, you can customize these indicators to be other characters or even colors. For example, `--indicator-style='*'` will display a asterisk (*) for regular files and no indicator for directories. `--indicator-style='@ % >'` will display an at-sign (@) for executable files, a percent sign (% ) for symbolic links, and a greater than sign (>) for directories. You can also specify colors using escape sequences in the format '\033[1;31m' to set foreground color and '\033[0m' to reset it.

            Here is an example: `ls --indicator-style='%{%F%} %B{*}.txt%{+%f %b}'` will display the filename with a star (*) before it for all files that end in '.txt'.
        inode: '[AI] The `ls --inode` command is a Linux/Unix terminal command used to list the files in a directory with their inode number added to the output. The option `--inode` requests that the output includes the inode number, which is a unique identifier assigned to each file in a Unix-based file system. This can be useful for identifying and comparing files based on their inode numbers.'
        kibibytes: '[AI] The `ls --kilobytes` command in Linux is used to list the contents of a directory with file sizes displayed in kilobytes (KB) instead of the default bytes or blocks. The `--kilobytes` option ensures that the output size is shown in units of KB, making it easier for users to understand and compare file sizes.'
        l: |-
            [AI] The `ls -l` command is a common Unix or Linux terminal command used to list directory contents in a long format. The `-l` option stands for "long listing" and displays each file or directory with detailed information including:

            1. File size
            2. Permissions (read, write, execute) for the owner, group, and others
            3. Owner's name and group name
            4. Date and time of last modification
            5. File/directory name

            This format helps users understand more about the files they are working with, including their size, ownership, and when they were last modified.
        literal: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `--literal` or `-N` option displays files and directories with slashes (`/`) instead of indenting them when listing directory contents. It also shows dot files and hidden directories without a leading dot in the output. This option is useful for interpreting directory listings as text, particularly in scripts or automated processes.'
        m: '[AI] The `ls` command with the option `-m` displays the file permissions in the traditional, symbolic format instead of the default numeric format. For instance, instead of displaying `drwxr-xr-x`, it will show `drwxr-xr-x`. This is useful when you want to quickly interpret file permissions at a glance without having to convert the numeric value into symbols.'
        no-group: '[AI] The `ls --no-group` command is a variation of the standard Linux `ls` (list) command, which is used to list the contents of a directory. The `--no-group` option tells the `ls` command not to display the group ownership information for each file or directory in the output. This results in only the filename, permissions, and user ownership being displayed.'
        numeric-uid-gid: |-
            [AI] The `ls` command with the `--numeric-uid-gid` option is used to list directory contents and display file ownership and group membership in numerical form, instead of the usual symbolic names. This can be useful for identifying files based on their numeric user ID (UID) and group ID (GID), rather than their respective user or group names. For example, `ls -ld /path/to/file` would display the file's permissions, ownership, and group membership as a series of numbers, like this:

            ```
            drwxr-xr-x 2 user123 group456 4096 Nov 11 12:34 /path/to/directory
            -rw-r--r-- 1 user7 user3 1234 Nov 11 13:45 /path/to/file
            ```

            In this example, the first column (the `1` in `-rw-r--r--`) represents the file type (regular file), and the next three numbers (`1 user7`) represent the file's UID. The next group of three numbers (`1 user3`) represent the file's GID. The last two numbers are the file size and modification time, respectively.
        o: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `-o` option in Unix or Linux lists the output in a human-readable format that shows the file ownership details. This includes the user name and UID, group name and GID for each file in the directory.'
        quote-name: '[AI] The `--quote-name` option in the `ls` command is used to quote filenames or directories with special characters, ensuring they are treated as a single argument when passed to another command. This prevents the shell from interpreting the special characters and ensures that the filename is transmitted intact. For example, if a file name contains spaces or other special characters, `--quote-name` can be used to enclose it in quotes when generating output for further processing.'
        quoting-style: |-
            [AI] The `--quoting-style` option in the `ls` command is used to specify how filenames with special characters should be quoted when displayed in a list. By default, `ls` uses no quoting or "plain" quoting for filenames that do not require quoting for safe interpretation by the shell.

            The following quoting styles are available:

            1. **No quoting (--quoting-style=none):** The default behavior where no special characters in filenames are quoted.
            2. **C-style escaping (--quoting-style=cquote or --quoting-style=\):** Filenames with special characters are escaped using the backslash character (`\`). For example, a file named "file with spaces.txt" would be displayed as "file with spaces.txt".
            3. **Shell-style escaping (--quoting-style=single-quote or --quoting-style=s):** Filenames with special characters are enclosed in single quotes (''). For example, a file named "file with spaces.txt" would be displayed as "'file with spaces.txt'".
            4. **Shell-style escaping with backslash (--quoting-style=double-quote or --quoting-style=d):** Filenames with special characters are enclosed in double quotes ("") and escaped using a backslash (\) before the special character. For example, a file named "file with spaces.txt" would be displayed as "'file with spaces.txt'".
            5. **Pathname-style escaping (--quoting-style=escape or --quoting-style=p):** Filenames with special characters are escaped using the backslash character (\) before each special character. For example, a file named "file with spaces.txt" would be displayed as "\file\ with\ spaces.txt".

            In summary, `--quoting-style` option allows you to customize how filenames containing special characters are displayed when using the `ls` command.
        recursive: |-
            [AI] The `ls --recursive` command is a combination of two options used in Unix or Linux file listing commands: `ls` and `--recursive`.

            The `ls` command is used to list the files and directories present in the current directory. The `--recursive` option, also known as `-R`, tells the `ls` command to display the contents of all subdirectories recursively. As a result, this command displays the entire directory tree structure from the given directory, listing all files and directories including those hidden ones.
        reverse: '[AI] The `ls --reverse` command in Unix-based systems is used to list directory contents in reverse order, with the newest files or directories appearing first before the older ones. This option overrides the default behavior of `ls` which lists items in chronological order based on their modification time, with the oldest ones first. The `--reverse` flag reverses this order for a clearer view of the most recently added or modified items at the top of the output.'
        show-control-chars: '[AI] The `ls --show-control-chars` command in Linux is an option used with the `ls` listing utility. This option enables the display of control characters, which are not normally visible in the terminal output, as graphical representations. For instance, a tab character will be displayed as ^I, a backspace as ^H, and so on. It helps in identifying and debugging issues related to invisible characters in file names or directories.'
        si: |-
            [AI] The `ls --si` command is a combination of the `ls` (list) utility and two options: `--size-isomantic` (`-i`) and `--human-readable` (`-h`), typically used together as `--si` for short.

            This command lists the contents of a directory in human-readable format, displaying file sizes in units of KB, MB, or GB, along with the usual file name, permissions, and ownership details. The `-i` option adds file index numbers to the output, which can help distinguish files with identical names.
        size: '[AI] The `ls --size` command is used in Unix or Linux terminal to list the files and directories with their file sizes displayed in human-readable format next to them. The `--size` option enables this behavior, whereby the output shows the name of each file followed by its size in blocks (1 block = 1024 bytes), then in megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), or terabytes (TB) depending on the magnitude of the size. It is a convenient way to quickly assess the disk usage of files and directories within a directory.'
        sort: |-
            [AI] The `ls` command in Unix-based systems is used to list the files and directories in a directory. The `--sort` option tells `ls` to sort the output based on a specified criterion, which can be one of the following:

            * `-t` : by modification time, newest first
            * `-r` : reverse order (oldest first for `-t`)
            * `-T` : show file type indication
            * `-m` : sort by size, largest first
            * `-S` : sort by total file size, largest first (for directories, the size is the directory's disk usage)
            * `-n` : sort by filename with numeric prefixes indicating order (for files and directories)

            By default, when no option is given to the `--sort` option, the output is sorted alphabetically in lexicographic order.
        t: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `-t` option in Unix or Linux lists the files in a directory with the newest files first, instead of the default alphabetical order. The `-t` stands for "sort by modification time," with the newest files appearing at the bottom of the output.'
        tabsize: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `--tabsize` option is used in Unix-like operating systems for listing files and directories in a tabular format. The option sets the size of tabs displayed in the output to the given number of columns, which by default is usually 8. This can be useful when dealing with long filenames or pathnames that require more space to display properly. For instance, `ls --tabsize=12` sets the tab size to 12 columns.'
        time: '[AI] The `ls --time` command in Unix-based systems is used to list the contents of a directory with file modification times displayed. The `--time` option makes `ls` display files arranged by their modification time, with the newest files first (`-t`) or oldest files first (`-T`). The format of the displayed time can be customized using other options like `--date=FORMAT`. Without any specific time format specified, the default is a human-readable format.'
        time-style: '[AI] The `--time-style` option in the `ls` command is used to customize the display format of the timestamps shown for files and directories when using the `ls` command in the Unix or Linux terminal. It accepts various formats like `%T`, `%t`, `%h`, `%p`, `%F`, etc., which can be combined to create different styles. For example, `--time-style="+%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Y"` would display the month (`%m`), day (`%d`), hour (`%H`), minute (`%M`), second (`%S`), and year (`%Y`) in the format `mm-dd hh:mm:ss yyyy`. It helps users to easily identify the age, or the modification time, of files based on their requirements.'
        u: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `-u` option in Unix or Linux displays the listing of files and directories with an extra column showing the file modification time, represented as a timestamp using the format `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss`. This is useful for identifying which files have been modified most recently.'
        v: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `-v` option in Unix or Linux lists the contents of a directory in verbose mode. It provides more detailed information about each file and directory, including timestamps (accessed, modified, and changed) and permissions in a human-readable format. The output is sorted by modification time, with the newest files appearing last.'
        version: '[AI] `ls --version` is a command used in Unix-based systems to display detailed information about the version of the `ls` (list) utility installed in the system. The output includes the name of the implementation, its release date, and other relevant details. This command helps users to check for updates or differences between various implementations of the `ls` utility.'
        width: '[AI] The `ls` command with the `--width=<number>` option is used in Unix-based systems to list directory contents, displaying each file name with a maximum width of <number>. This means that only the first <number> characters of each file name will be shown. If a filename is longer than <number>, it will be truncated and followed by an ellipsis (`...`) to indicate that the name has been shortened. This option can help prevent long filenames from wrapping when listing directory contents in narrow terminal windows.'
        x: '[AI] The command `ls -x` is used in Unix-based systems to list the contents of a directory with one important option: `-x`. This option causes the output to be sorted based on the collating sequence, which can be useful when dealing with multilingual filenames or non-ASCII characters. It doesn''t display hidden files by default, unlike the common `ls -l` command. If you want to see hidden files along with other files, you should use `ls -d * --color=auto`. However, if your goal is only to sort multilingual filenames, then using `ls -x` alone should suffice.'
