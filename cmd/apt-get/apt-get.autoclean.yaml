description: Like clean, but only removes package files that can no longer be downloaded
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `apt-get autoclean` is a command used in Debian-based Linux distributions to remove unused downloaded package files from the local APT (Advanced Package Tool) cache. This command helps to save disk space by eliminating unnecessary data and keeping the cache clean, which can improve the overall system performance. By running `apt-get autoclean`, you ensure that only the essential packages and their dependencies are kept in the cache, reducing clutter and potential security vulnerabilities from outdated cached files.'
