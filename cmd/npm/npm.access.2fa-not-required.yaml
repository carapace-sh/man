documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm` (Node Package Manager) command `npm access 2fa-not-required` is used to disable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for an npm publishing account. This means that no 2FA code will be required when publishing or managing packages under that account. To use this command, you need to authenticate with your npm account using the `npm login` command first, then run `npm access 2fa-not-required --yes`. The `--yes` flag is used to confirm the action without further prompts. This command should only be used if you don''t require an additional security layer for your npm publishing account.'
