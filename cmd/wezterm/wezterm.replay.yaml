documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `wezterm replay` command is used in WezTerm, a modern terminal emulator, to apply a recorded session replay. This command loads and executes a previously saved terminal session, allowing users to reproduce the same environment, input, and output as the original session. It can be useful for debugging, demonstrating steps in a tutorial or report, or quickly restoring a previous terminal state.'
    flag:
        cat: '[AI] `wezterm replay --cat` is a command used in the WezTerm terminal emulator to load and display the contents of a saved terminal session as text, rather than replaying the entire session with its input history, output, and other state. The `--cat` flag instructs WezTerm to print the session data as plain text to the standard output instead of opening a new terminal window or restoring an existing one.'
        explain: '[AI] `wezterm replay --explain` is a command used in Wezterm, a cross-platform terminal emulator, to generate an explanation of the state changes applied during the replay of a recording. The `--explain` option provides detailed information about each step taken during the replay process, making it easier for users to understand what actions were performed and why. This can be useful for debugging or analyzing terminal sessions.'
        explain-only: '[AI] `wezterm replay --explain-only` is a command used in Wezterm, a modern terminal emulator, to explain the actions that would be taken if the `replay` command was executed with valid arguments. The `--explain-only` flag causes Wezterm to print out a description of those actions without actually executing them. This can be helpful for understanding the effects of complex configurations or sequences of terminal events before applying them.'
        help: '[AI] `wezterm replay --help` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator, to display help information about the `replay` subcommand. The `replay` subcommand allows loading and playing back a recording of terminal sessions for automatic execution of commands or reproducing previous console states. The `--help` option provides detailed explanation on how to use this command along with available options.'
