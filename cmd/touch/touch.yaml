documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `touch` command in Unix-based systems is used to create or update empty files, or change the modification and access times of existing files. It can also be used to create new directories if specified with the `-d` or `-c` option. By default, it does not write any data to the file.'
    flag:
        a: '[AI] The `touch -a` command is a Unix utility used to update the modification and access times of files. The `-a` option specifically modifies only the file''s access time, leaving its modification time unchanged. This can be useful when you want to mark that a file has been accessed recently, without making any changes to its content or metadata.'
        date: '[AI] The `touch --date` command is a utility in Unix-based systems used to update the modification and access time stamps of a file or create an empty file with a given timestamp. The `--date` option allows specifying a custom date and time for the file''s metadata using the format `[YYYY]-MM-DD [HH:MM]`. This can be useful when manipulating files with specific timestamps, such as when dealing with data that needs to conform to certain deadlines or requirements.'
        f: '[AI] The `touch -f` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems used to update the modification time or change the file status of given files. The `-f` option stands for "force" and is used to avoid creating backup files when using the `touch` command to update an existing file. In other words, it overwrites the file without asking for confirmation.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `touch --help` command is a part of the GNU Core Utilities and is used to modify file timestamps or create an empty file with a given name. When you run `touch --help`, it displays the help information for this command, including available options such as:

            * `-a, --atomic-create`: Create a new file without writing any content but only updating its timestamp.
            * `-c, --no-create`: Do not create empty files.
            * `-m, --modify-time=TIME`: Modify the file's modification time instead of its access or change time.
            * `-r, --recursive`: Apply the operation to all files and directories in the given list recursively.
            * `-t, --time=TIMESTAMP`: Set the file's timestamp based on a specified timestamp string.
            * `FILE...`: The files to be modified or created.

            This command is essential for managing timestamps and creating/updating empty files in Unix-based systems.
        m: '[AI] The `touch -m` command in Unix-based systems is used to update the modification time of a file, without changing its contents. The `-m` option stands for "modification time only." When you run `touch -m filename`, the file''s timestamp is updated to the current time, while its data remains unchanged.'
        no-create: '[AI] The `touch --no-create` command in Unix or Linux is used to update the modification and access times of a file without changing its size or creating a new file if it doesn''t exist. In simpler terms, it modifies the timestamp of an existing file, while preventing the creation of a new file.'
        no-dereference: |-
            [AI] The `touch` command in Unix-based systems is used to update file timestamps or create empty files. The `--no-dereference` option changes its behavior when dealing with symbolic links.

            By default, if you use `touch` on a symbolic link, the timestamp of the symbolic link itself will be updated. However, with the `--no-dereference` flag, the command will not change the timestamp of the symbolic link but instead update the timestamps of the files that the symbolic link points to (the files it is linked to). In other words, this option makes `touch` operate on the files at the end of the link rather than the link itself.
        reference: '[AI] The `touch --reference` flag is used in Unix-based file systems to update the modification time of a file based on the modification time of another file. This command does not change the size or content of the original file, but only modifies its timestamp to match that of the reference file. It can be particularly useful when managing symbolic links or for version control systems to maintain accurate timestamps during file operations.'
        t: '[AI] The `touch` command with the `-t` option in Unix or Linux sets the modification time or last-modified timestamp of a file to a specified date and time. This can be used to update the timestamp without changing the file''s content. The format of the date argument is `"[YYYY]-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"` or `"[MJD.hhmm.ss]"` where `YYYY` is the year, `MM` is the month, `DD` is the day, `HH` is the hour, `MM` is the minute, and `SS` is the second. For example, `touch -t "2023-01-01 12:34:56" filename.txt` sets the timestamp of the file `filename.txt` to January 1, 2023, at 12:34:56 PM.'
        time: |-
            [AI] The `touch` command with the `--time` option in Unix-based systems allows modifying the file access, modification, or change times without altering the file content. It takes the following syntax:

            ```bash
            touch --time=<timestamp> <file>
            ```

            The `<timestamp>` argument can be:

            * A date and time in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (e.g., `2023-03-14 15:30:00`)
            * The special keywords `now`, `-t`, or `--reference=<file>`. In this case, the new timestamp will be the current date and time (`now`), the specified file's timestamp (`-t`), or the file's modification/last access time (`--reference=<file>`).

            For example:

            * `touch --time="2023-03-14 15:30:00" file.txt` sets the file's last modification time to March 14, 2023, at 3:30 PM.
            * `touch --time="-t" file.txt` sets the file's access and modification times to the current date and time. This command does not change the file's content or size.
        version: '[AI] The `touch --version` command is used in Unix-based systems to display the version information of the touch utility, which is a simple file manipulation program for updating the modification and access times of files or creating empty new files. When executed with the `--version` option, it will print out detailed information about the specific version of the touch command installed on your system, including its name, version number, and sometimes other details like compilation date or operating system.'
