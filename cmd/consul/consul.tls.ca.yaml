documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul tls ca` command is used to generate or manage Certificate Authority (CA) certificates in Consul, a Connect and Service Discovery tool by Hashicorp. These CA certificates are essential for enabling secure communication between different components using TLS encryption. When you run the command without any arguments, it lists existing CAs; with the `create` flag, it generates a new CA; and with the `read`, `write`, or `key` flags, you can manipulate the details of an existing CA.'
