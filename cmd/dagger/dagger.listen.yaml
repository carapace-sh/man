documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dagger listen` is a Dagger-CI command used to start a listening process for incoming builds and test results from Docker registries or GitHub webhooks. It sets up an HTTP server that listens for incoming webhook events, processes them, and triggers the corresponding build or test jobs in a Dagger pipeline. This helps keep your builds and tests synced with your source code changes in real time.'
    flag:
        allow-cors: '[AI] `flag "listen" --allow-cors` is a configuration option in Dagger, an open-source build tool for Docker and Kubernetes, which enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) when the Dagger server listens for incoming connections. Enabling CORS allows communication between domains that would otherwise be considered as originating from different sites, and is necessary for certain web applications that make API requests to a different domain than their own.'
        disable-host-read-write: '[AI] The `dagger` command you provided is a part of the Dagger CLI, which is used for building and managing container images. The option `--disable-host-read-write` disables read and write access from the containers to the host filesystem. This means that containers built or run with this flag set will not be able to modify or access files on the host machine unless specifically configured otherwise. It''s a security measure, limiting potential damage if a container is compromised.'
        listen: '[AI] The `flag "--listen" in dagger` command is used to specify the address and port number on which Docker images will be pulled and services will be published when running a Docker Compose file using Dagger. For example, `--listen 0.0.0.0:8080` sets the listen address to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces) and the port number to 8080. This allows other systems on the network to connect to the services running in the Docker environment.'
