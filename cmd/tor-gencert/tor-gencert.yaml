documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tor-gencert` is a command-line tool used to generate self-signed SSL certificates for Tor hidden services. These certificates are essential for securing communication between clients and the hidden service. The tool utilizes OpenSSL to create RSA private keys and corresponding X.509 certificates, binding them to the specified hidden service identity key. The generated certificate files can then be used to configure the hidden service configuration file (`hidden_service.conf`) for proper SSL encryption.'
    flag:
        a: '[AI] The `tor-gencert -a` command is used to generate a new self-signed certificate authority (CA) key and certificate pair in The Onion Router (Tor) network. This command creates a new CA that can be used to sign other certificates, providing an additional layer of security in Tor''s SSL/TLS encrypted communications. The `-a` option stands for "authority," indicating the generation of a new CA rather than a regular certificate.'
        c: '[AI] The `tor-gencert -c` command is used in The Onion Router (Tor) network to generate a new Certificate Authority (CA) key and certificate. This command creates a self-signed root CA certificate that can be used to sign other certificates for Tor hidden services or bridges. The `-c` option specifies the output file name for the generated CA key and certificate.'
        create-identity-key: '[AI] `tor-gencert --create-identity-key` is a command used in The Onion Router (Tor) network to generate a new identity key for anonymizing web browsing or other Tor applications. This key, also known as a certificate, is crucial for establishing secure communication channels through the Tor network by encrypting and authenticating data exchanged between parties. When you run this command, it creates a new private-public key pair for your Tor client, and saves the public key in a PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail) format file for later use with other Tor applications or configurations.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `tor-gencert` is a command-line tool used in the Tor Project to generate and sign Onion Services certificates for hidden services. The `--help` option displays a usage message with detailed information about the command's arguments and options:

            1. **Usage**: Shows the basic syntax of the command, including the name and the version number.
            2. **Options**: Lists all available options and their descriptions, such as:
               - `-c <certname>`: Specify a custom certificate name.
               - `-f <keyfile>`: Provide the private key file for signing.
               - `-o <outputfile>`: Output file location for the generated certificate.
            3. **Arguments**: Lists any required arguments, like the identity key for the hidden service.
            4. **Examples**: Provides examples of using the command with various options and arguments.

            In summary, the `tor-gencert --help` option displays comprehensive information about how to use the tool to generate Onion Services certificates for Tor hidden services.
        i: '[AI] `tor-gencert -i` is a command used with The Onion Router (Tor) network software to generate a new self-signed certificate for Tor services, such as Tor bridges or hidden services. This command interacts with the Tor certificate authority (CA), using an input file (-i) that specifies the details of the new certificate, including its common name, organization name, and location. The generated certificate is then saved in a file format suitable for use with Tor.'
        m: '[AI] The `tor-gencert -m` command is used in the Tor project to generate a new Certificate Authority (CA) certificate. The `-m` option specifies that a new CA certificate should be created, and it will overwrite any existing CA certificate file specified. This command is an essential part of the Tor network''s security as the CA certificate is used to sign other certificates that ensure secure communication between Tor nodes.'
        passphrase-fd: |-
            [AI] The `tor-gencert --passphrase-fd` command is used to generate a new Onion Service certificate for Tor with a custom passphrase, read from a file descriptor instead of being interactively entered at the terminal.

            The Tor Onion Service allows hiding the IP address of a server behind an encrypted onion layer, providing enhanced privacy and security. The `--passphrase-fd` option instructs the `tor_gencert` utility to read the passphrase from an open file descriptor instead of the standard input. This can be useful for automation processes or scripts where storing sensitive data in plain text should be avoided.
        reuse: '[AI] The `tor-gencert --reuse` command is used in the Tor network to generate or renew a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate with an existing private key, instead of generating a new private key and CA certificate pair. By using the `--reuse` option, the existing CA private key file is utilized during the certificate generation process, saving the need for generating a new private key. This can be beneficial when dealing with long-lived certificates, as it avoids having to generate and distribute a new private key, which can be a complex and time-consuming task.'
        s: '[AI] The `tor-gencert -s` command is used in the Tor network to generate a new certificate authority (CA) key and self-signed certificate for use with the Tor directory authority system. The `-s` flag stands for "signing key" and indicates that a new signing key will be generated as part of the certificate creation process. This command helps maintain the security and trustworthiness of the Tor network by periodically generating new keys and certificates to replace expiring or compromised ones.'
        v: '[AI] The `tor-gencert -v` command is a utility from The Tor Project used to generate and manage Onion Service certificates for the Tor network. It''s essential for running hidden services over Tor. The `-v` flag stands for verbose mode, which means it will provide detailed information about the certificate generation process in real-time. This can be helpful for debugging issues or understanding the steps involved in generating a new Onion Service certificate.'
