documentation:
    command: '[AI] `brew readall` is not a valid command in Homebrew, which is a popular package manager for macOS. There seems to be no official Homebrew command with that name. If you meant another command or tool with a similar name, please provide more context or check its specific documentation for accurate information.'
    flag:
        aliases: '[AI] `brew readall --aliases` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command displays and lists all the aliases (or shorthand commands) set up by Homebrew for various installed packages or formulas. An alias allows users to run complex commands with a simpler alternative, making it more convenient to use. The output will usually consist of a list of commands with their corresponding aliases.'
        arch: '[AI] The command `brew readall --arch` is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command retrieves detailed information about software packages that match the given architecture. The `--arch` option specifies the desired architecture, and `readall` is a utility to display the output in a more user-friendly way by wrapping long lines and paginating the output. In summary, this command displays detailed information for Homebrew packages that are compatible with the specified architecture.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew readall --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `readall` part of the command refers to a utility that displays the contents of text files one page at a time. The `--debug` flag enables debug mode, which can provide additional information about the command''s execution for troubleshooting purposes. Homebrew runs this command when you use it to install or update software packages from its repositories.'
        eval-all: '[AI] `brew readall --eval-all` is a command used in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS, to apply multiple Homebrew recipes at once. The `readall` subcommand lists all the output from Homebrew''s tap or formula commands and displays them one by one. The option `--eval-all` automatically executes each displayed line as a command, effectively applying all the listed recipes in one go.'
        help: '[AI] `brew readall --help` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux. This specific command displays the help information for the `readall` utility installed via Homebrew. `readall` is a simple pager that reads files one page at a time without interruption. By running `brew readall --help`, you can learn about the various options and usage details of this tool, including how to pipe files into it or set custom behaviors for displaying the content.'
        no-simulate: '[AI] `brew readall --no-simulate` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `readall` subcommand displays one page at a time the contents of a text file or multiple files, while `--no-simulate` option skips the simulation step. In other words, it directly installs and reads the manual pages (or "manpages") of Homebrew packages without showing a preview first. This can be useful when you want to quickly review manpages without going through an interactive interface or having extra graphics.'
        os: '[AI] The `brew readall --os` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command is used to list out all installed packages and their operating system (OS) versions. The `--os` option displays the OS version of each formula along with its name and version. The output can be piped to a pager such as `less` or `more` for easier viewing if the list is long.'
        quiet: '[AI] `brew readall --quiet` is a command used in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. This command reads the descriptions of installed Homebrew packages and displays no output if the `--quiet` flag is used. In other words, it runs the `readall` sub-command to list the descriptions quietly without any additional messages or prompts.'
        syntax: '[AI] `brew readall --syntax` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command displays the installation syntax or recipe of a specific Homebrew formula. The output shows the necessary steps to install or update the formula from source code. It is often used for troubleshooting or understanding the underlying details of how a formula is installed.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew readall --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `readall` subcommand displays the contents of a text file in the terminal one page at a time, while `--verbose` increases the amount of output to provide more detailed information about the process. Overall, this command allows users to view and understand the contents of a brew recipe file in greater detail.'
