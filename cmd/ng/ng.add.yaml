documentation:
    command: '[AI] `ng add` is a command used in Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) for adding new features or packages to an existing Angular project. It automatically installs, imports, and sets up the configured package in your Angular application''s configuration files like angular.json. You specify the name of the package or feature as an argument. For example: `ng add @angular/forms` or `ng add @angular/material`.'
    flag:
        defaults: '[AI] `ng add --defaults` is a command used with Angular CLI (Angular Command Line Interface). This command is used to add new Angular applications, libraries or packages into an existing workspace while using default configuration settings instead of prompting for each individual option during the setup process. It simplifies the installation process by accepting all defaults, making it a faster and more streamlined experience for developers familiar with the desired setup.'
        interactive: '[AI] `ng add --interactive` is a command used with Angular CLI (Angular Command Line Interface) for adding new Angular libraries or packages to a project. The `--interactive` flag enables an interactive installation process, allowing the user to confirm each package installation step before it is installed automatically. This way, the user has more control over what gets added to their project and can avoid unintended dependencies.'
        registry: '[AI] The `ng add --registry` command is used in Angular projects with the Angular CLI to configure a different package registry, such as npm or Yarn, for installing and managing dependencies. Instead of using the default registry (usually npm), you can specify an alternative one by providing the URL of the desired registry along with this command. This modification affects only the current project and does not change the registry for other projects in the workspace.'
        skip-confirmation: '[AI] `ng add --skip-confirmation` is a command used with Angular CLI (Angular Command Line Interface) for adding new features or packages to an Angular project. This option skips the confirmation prompt before installing the specified package. Instead of asking for confirmation each time, the installation process will run automatically without interruption.'
        verbose: '[AI] `ng add --verbose` is a command used with Angular CLI to install and add new Angular packages or features into an existing Angular project. The `--verbose` option increases the output of the command, providing more detailed information about the installation process, including the installed package name, version number, and installation progress. This can be helpful for debugging or understanding what packages are being added to your project.'
