documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant box outdated` command is used to check if there''s an updated version of the currently installed Vagrant box in your local machine or remote repository. It compares the current box version with the latest available version and displays the output, showing if an update is available or not. If an update is available, you can use `vagrant box update [box-name]` to download and install the newer version.'
    flag:
        cacert: |-
            [AI] The `vagrant box outdated` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machines, to check for available updates for installed Vagrant boxes. A box is a pre-prepared package that includes the configured operating system, installed packages, and any necessary configuration files.

            The `--cacert` option refers to the CA (Certificate Authority) certificate bundle file used by OpenSSL and other SSL/TLS libraries to verify the authenticity of SSL certificates presented during secure communication sessions. In this context, it's warning that there might be outdated CA certificates in your current configuration, which could cause issues with securing SSL communications when using Vagrant boxes. It doesn't directly indicate an issue with the Vagrant boxes themselves being outdated but rather a potential security concern with the CA certificates used to verify the box images during download.
        capath: '[AI] The command `vagrant box outdated --capath <path>` checks for updates of Vagrant boxes stored in the specified path. A Vagrant box is a pre-packaged environment for developing and testing software, containing all necessary components such as operating system, applications, and configurations. Running this command will display any available box updates to keep your development environment current.'
        cert: '[AI] The `vagrant box outdated --cert` command is used with Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command checks if the SSL certificates used by the repositories where Vagrant retrieves its boxes (preconfigured virtual machines) are up-to-date. If an outdated certificate is detected, it will alert you to update the certificate for security reasons.'
        force: |-
            [AI] The `vagrant box outdated` command checks if there is a newer version of the selected Vagrant box available in the official HashiCorp Atlas registry or any custom registries configured. If a new version exists, it will print the name and version number of the outdated box.

            Using `--force` option with this command forces Vagrant to use an outdated box version even if a new one is available. This can be useful when you want to keep using a specific old version for compatibility reasons or troubleshooting purposes, but it's generally recommended to update your boxes regularly for security and performance improvements.
        global: '[AI] The `vagrant box outdated --global` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments, to check for outdated or unavailable boxes (pre-configured virtual machines) on a global scale. It searches your Vagrantfile(s) in the current directory and all subdirectories, as well as any shared boxes you have access to through Vagrant Cloud, and returns a list of boxes with newer versions available than what''s currently being used. This command helps ensure that your Vagrant environments are using the latest versions of their respective base images, which may contain important security updates or new features.'
        insecure: '[AI] The `vagrant box outdated --insecure` command is used with Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. The command checks for outdated Vagrant boxes, which are pre-prepared environmental configurations, and flags any boxes that have known security vulnerabilities. If a box is both outdated and insecure, running `vagrant up` on that box could potentially expose your system to risks. It''s recommended to update or replace such boxes to maintain a secure environment.'
