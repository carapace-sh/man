    command: '[AI] `adb uninstall` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to uninstall an application from an Android device. The syntax is `adb uninstall <package_name>`, where `<package_name>` is the unique identifier of the app, which can be found in the device''s Settings or by using a package manager tool. When executed, ADB sends the uninstall command to the device and the specified application is removed from its storage.'
    flag:
        k: '[AI] The `adb uninstall -k` command is used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to uninstall an application using its signature key instead of its package name. This can be useful when multiple versions of an app have the same package name but different signatures, allowing you to selectively uninstall a specific version. The `-k` option specifies the signature key to match.'
