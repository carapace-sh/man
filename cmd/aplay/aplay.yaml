documentation:
    command: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing audio files in the Linux operating system. It reads raw audio data from standard input or from a named file and sends it to the sound device for playback. The user can specify options such as volume level, frequency rate, and channel configuration. For example, `aplay mysong.wav` plays the audio file "mysong.wav" using the default settings.'
    flag:
        avail-min: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing sound files in Linux. The option `--avail-mins` displays the number of minutes that the specified audio file will take to play, in decimal format. This can be useful for determining the duration of an audio file before playing it.'
        buffer-size: '[AI] The `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing audio files in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. The `--buffer-size` option specifies the size of the I/O buffer that `aplay` uses when reading or writing audio data from or to a file. Larger buffer sizes can improve the playback performance by reducing the number of read/write operations, but may also increase latency and consume more memory. The default value is usually determined by the system configuration and may depend on the specific hardware used for playback.'
        buffer-time: '[AI] The `aplay` command is a utility in Linux for playing audio files. The option `--buffer-time` sets the size of the output audio data buffer. A larger buffer size results in smoother playback with less latency, but requires more memory and may cause longer delay before sound starts playing. Conversely, a smaller buffer size uses less memory but may result in choppy or interrupted sound. The default value for this option is typically 128 MB.'
        channels: '[AI] The `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing audio files in Linux. The option `--channels=NUM` specifies the number of audio channels to play. For example, `aplay --channels=2 filename.wav` plays the file with stereo sound (two channels), while `aplay --channels=1 filename.wav` plays it as mono sound (one channel).'
        chmap: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing audio files in Unix-based systems. The option `--chunk-size` or `-Ch` followed by the number specifies the size of an individual PCM data chunk in bytes. With the option `--format` or `-t`, you can specify the audio format, and with `--map` or `-M`, you can map multiple input files to output channels. So, `aplay --chmap` would be used to set the channel mapping for multi-channel audio input files when playing them with `aplay`.'
        device: '[AI] The `aplay` command in Linux is a simple program used to play audio files. The option `--device` is used to specify the output sound device for the audio playback. For example, `aplay --device=plughw:SCARD_PLAYBACK_CAP_NAME` plays an audio file using the "plughw" (PulseAudio SoundCard Hardware) sound device. This option allows users to redirect audio output to specific hardware devices or software applications, such as PulseAudio or ALSA, for better customization and control of the audio playback experience.'
        disable-channels: '[AI] The `aplay` command with the option `--disable-channels` is used to disable channel mapping in AlsaPlay, a simple sound file player for Linux. Channel mapping allows routing audio data from multiple channels of a sound file to specific hardware output channels (stereo, quad etc.). With the `--disable-channels` option, Aplay will play the sound with all channels mixed into one instead. This can be useful when playing sounds on systems with limited or no support for multi-channel audio outputs.'
        disable-format: '[AI] The `aplay` command with the option `--disable-format` disables the automatic detection and setting of the output format when playing a sound file. Instead, the user specifies the format manually using other options or arguments. This can be useful when dealing with specific file formats that may not be automatically detected or when playing multiple files in different formats within one command.'
        disable-resample: '[AI] The `aplay` command with the option `--disable-resample` disables the resampling process when playing a sound file. Resampling is the process of converting a digital audio file from one sample rate to another, which can change the audio''s properties, such as its pitch or frequency response. By disabling resampling, the original audio file will be played at its native sample rate without any modifications. This option ensures that the audio is played back with minimal processing and potential quality loss.'
        disable-softvol: '[AI] The command `aplay --disable-softvol` is used in Linux to play an audio file using the `aplay` (Advanced Player) utility. The `--disable-softvol` option disables software volume control for the audio output, meaning that the system''s volume settings won''t affect the playback volume of this specific command. This can be useful when you want to play an audio file at a consistent volume level without being affected by the master volume or other applications.'
        dump-hw-params: '[AI] The command `aplay --dump-hw-params` is used with the `aplay` (Advanced Linux Programmable Alarm) utility in Linux systems for checking and displaying the hardware parameters of the audio output device currently set for playback. This includes details such as sample rate, sample size, channels, and buffer size. The output is displayed in a human-readable format, providing useful information when troubleshooting or configuring audio settings.'
        duration: '[AI] The `aplay` command is a simple text-based audio player in Unix-like operating systems, used to play WAV or Sun AU format sound files. The `--duration` option is used to display the estimated duration of the sound file being played, without actually playing it. This option can be useful for getting an idea of how long the file is before deciding whether to play it in full or not. For example, you could use a command like `aplay --duration myfile.wav` to check the length of the file `myfile.wav` without playing it. The output will display something like `0:01:23.578`, representing hours:minutes:seconds.milliseconds.'
        fatal-errors: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing audio files in Unix-like operating systems. The option `--fatal-errors` instructs `aplay` to terminate immediately upon encountering any error, instead of continuing with the remaining audio files. This can be useful when debugging or when dealing with critical errors that warrant immediate attention.'
        file-type: |-
            [AI] The `aplay` command with the option `--file-type` is used to play a sound file while displaying its file type. For instance, if you have an audio file named "example.wav", you can use the following command to play it and show its file type:

            ```bash
            aplay --file-type=identify -f wav example.wav
            ```

            This command will output something like:

            ```plaintext
            identifying WAVE 'example.wav'... What is this file format? [Press return to continue]: wav
            Playing: example.wav
            ```

            Here, `aplay` is using the `--file-type=identify` option to determine the file type before playing it. The output "wav" confirms that the file is indeed a WAV format. This command can be useful for troubleshooting or verifying the file format of an audio file before playing it with other media players.
        format: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing audio files in Linux and Unix systems. The option `--format` is used to specify the output format when saving the audio output to a file instead of playing it directly. For example, `aplay --format=wav myaudiofile.wav` will save the output of `aplay myaudiofile.wav` to a WAV file named "myaudiofile.wav". It is important to note that not all output formats are supported by all installations of `aplay`.'
        help: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing audio files in Unix-based systems. The option `--help` is used to display detailed information about how to use the `aplay` command, including available options and their descriptions. This helps users understand how to correctly play audio files with `aplay`.'
        interactive: '[AI] The `aplay` command with the `--interactive` option is used to play a sound file interactively in the terminal. This means that instead of playing the entire file at once, it allows users to control the playback in real-time using keyboard commands. For instance, users can pause, resume or stop the audio by pressing keys like `Space`, `q` or `Ctrl+C`. This option is useful for applications where users need to perform specific tasks during audio playback.'
        list-devices: '[AI] The `aplay` command with the option `--list-devices` is used to display a list of available soundplayback devices on a Linux system. It provides information about the device name, index number, and other attributes such as type and mixer controls. This command helps in selecting specific output devices while playing audio files using `aplay` or other applications that depend on this information for proper functionality.'
        list-pcms: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing audio files in Linux. The option `--list-pcms` is used to display a list of available hardware PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) devices or soundcards supported by ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture). This can be helpful when trying to determine which device to use when playing audio with aplay or other applications. The output will usually include the device name, index number, and other relevant information such as mixer controls.'
        max-file-time: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing audio files in Linux and Unix systems. The option `--max-file-time=<duration>` sets a limit on the total duration of one or multiple audio files that are being played with the `aplay` command. The argument `<duration>` specifies the maximum allowed time in seconds or in the format `HH:MM:SS`. This option is useful when you want to play a specific number of files up to a certain maximum duration, preventing longer files from interrupting your playlist.'
        mmap: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line audio player for Linux. The option `--mmap` enables memory-mapped file I/O. With this flag, instead of reading an audio file into memory in its entirety before playing it, the file is memory-mapped, meaning that only the parts needed for playback are loaded into memory, reducing the required memory usage and improving performance when dealing with large audio files.'
        nonblock: '[AI] The `aplay` is a command-line audio player in Linux for playing WAV or Sun AU audio files. The option `--nonblock` tells `aplay` not to wait for the entire file to finish playing before returning control back to the terminal. This means that other commands can be run concurrently while the sound is being played, making it useful for applications where you want to play background music or sounds without disrupting ongoing processes.'
        period-size: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing audio files in Linux and UNIX systems. The option `--period-size N` sets the size of each period, which is the amount of data that ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) plays before checking if more data is available. A larger period size can lead to lower latency but higher CPU usage, while a smaller period size has the opposite effect.'
        period-time: '[AI] The `aplay` command is a Linux utility for playing audio files. The option `--period-time` sets the time, in microseconds, between each period of playback. This can be used to adjust the tempo or pitch of the audio file without changing its actual data. For example, setting a shorter period time will make the audio play faster, while a longer period time will make it play slower.'
        process-id-file: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing audio files in Linux and Unix systems. The option `--process-id-file` is used to write the process ID (PID) of the running `aplay` instance into a specified file upon completion of the audio playback. This option can be useful for automating tasks or coordinating actions between different processes. For example, you could use it to ensure that an application closes after playing a sound effect by writing its PID into a file and then sending a signal to terminate it once `aplay` has finished playing the audio file.'
        quiet: '[AI] The command `aplay --quiet` is used with the `aplay` media player in Linux to play an audio file silently. The `--quiet` option prevents any output or messages from being displayed during the playback process, making it useful for playing background music or audio files without interruptions.'
        rate: '[AI] The `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing audio files in Linux and other Unix systems. The option `--rate` sets the playback sampling rate of the audio file. A higher rate results in better sound quality but larger file sizes, while a lower rate reduces file size at the cost of potentially decreased sound quality.'
        samples: '[AI] The `aplay` command is a Linux utility for playing audio files. The option `--samples <num>` specifies that only the specified number of samples from the audio file should be played. This can be useful for testing or examining small portions of an audio file without having to play the entire file.'
        start-delay: '[AI] The `aplay` command is a text-based console application used to play audio files from the Linux terminal. The option `--start-delay` sets a delay in milliseconds before starting the audio playback. This can be useful when you need to synchronize an audio file with another event or process. For example, using `--start-delay 500` would cause a 0.5 second delay before playing the audio file.'
        stop-delay: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing audio files in Linux and Unix systems. The option `--stop-delay` sets a delay time before the audio playback stops when using the `aplay --pause` or `aplay --stop` commands. This allows for a graceful ending of the sound, preventing any sudden cuts that might be unpleasant or disruptive to the listener. For example, if you use `aplay --stop-delay 1s filename`, the audio will stop with a one-second delay before the command terminates.'
        test-coef: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility in Linux used for playing audio files. The option `--test-coef` is not a standard option for `aplay`. It seems to be specific to certain distributions or configurations. Its purpose is to test the coefficients of the digital signal processing pipeline, likely for calibration or diagnostic purposes. When used, it writes the coefficients to standard output, allowing users to compare them with known good values or observe changes over time.'
        test-nowait: '[AI] The `aplay` command with the option `--test-nowait` is used to check if a given audio file can be played by `aplay` without actually playing the sound. The `--test-nowait` flag tells `aplay` not to wait for the sound to finish before exiting the program, making it useful for quickly checking large or numerous files without having to listen to each one in full. This is particularly helpful when working with audio files programmatically or in scripting contexts.'
        test-position: '[AI] The `aplay` is a command-line utility in Linux for playing audio files. The option `--test-position` is used to check the current position of an audio file being played by `aplay`. When this option is used, `aplay` outputs the current position of the playback in seconds, along with other information such as the total duration and sample rate. This can be useful for troubleshooting or for automating playback tasks where you need to keep track of the position.'
        use-strftime: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility for playing audio files in Unix-like operating systems. The option `--use-strftime` is used to apply strftime formatting to the time displayed when playing multiple files. Strftime is a Unix function that formats date and time information based on a given format string. So, `aplay --use-strftime` allows you to customize the output timestamp format while playing multiple audio files using aplay.'
        verbose: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility in Linux for playing audio files. The option `--verbose` is used to increase the amount of output displayed during the execution of the command. This can be helpful for troubleshooting or gaining insight into the audio playback process. With this option, you will get more detailed information about the file being played, such as its format and sample rate, as well as any decoding or conversion processes that are taking place before playback starts.'
        version: '[AI] `aplay` is a command-line utility for Linux and Unix systems used to play sound files. The command `aplay --version` is used to display the version information of the installed `aplay` package, including its release name, version number, and compilation date. This can be helpful in confirming which version of `aplay` is currently installed, or when troubleshooting potential compatibility issues with specific audio files or configurations.'
        vumeter: '[AI] The command `aplay --vmeter` is used with the `aplay` media player in Linux to display real-time volume meter levels while playing an audio file. The option `--vmeter` enables the virtual volume meter, showing the audio output level as a graphical representation of sound waves in the terminal window. This can be useful for monitoring and adjusting audio playback volumes or checking for clipping issues.'
