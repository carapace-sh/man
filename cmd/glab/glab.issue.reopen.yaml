description: Reopen a closed issue
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `glab` is a Git wrapper tool for GitHub''s `hub` and `git-fetch-recipe` commands. The `issue reopen` command is used to reopen an already closed GitHub Issue in the local repository. When you run this command, it fetches the latest state of the issue from the remote GitHub repository and updates your local issue file with the new data, effectively reopening the issue. Remember that this doesn''t automatically open the issue on GitHub; it only updates your local copy. To push the change to GitHub, you can use `glab push origin <branch>`.'
