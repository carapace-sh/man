documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `date` command is used to display or set the system''s date and time in Unix-like operating systems. When run without any arguments, it will print out the current date and time according to the system''s settings. If options are provided, it can be used to set the system date and time, format output, or query specific components of the date and time such as the year, month, day, hour, minute, or second.'
    flag:
        date: '[AI] The `date --date` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems for displaying or setting the system date and time. The `--date` option allows specifying a date and time in various formats as an argument, which can be used to set the system clock to that particular point in time or to display the corresponding date and time based on a given format. For instance, `date --date="2023-03-15 14:30:00"` sets the date and time to March 15, 2023, at 2:30 PM, while `date --date="3 days from now +2 hours"` sets the date and time to be three days after the current date and time plus two hours.'
        debug: '[AI] The `date --debug` command is a diagnostic option for the `date` utility in Unix-like operating systems. When invoked with this flag, it prints out extensive debugging information about the system''s date and time settings. This data includes details about the system clock, various time zones, and the rules used to calculate the local date and time from UTC. It is primarily used for troubleshooting issues related to the system clock or time zone configuration.'
        file: '[AI] The `date --file` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to set the system date and time based on a file containing a valid date and time format, typically created by another computer or device. The file should contain a series of white-space separated fields representing year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and possibly timezone information. When passed as an argument to `date --file`, the system will parse the file and set its date and time accordingly.'
        help: '[AI] The `date --help` command is used in Unix-like operating systems to display help information about the `date` utility. This command provides a brief explanation of the different options and arguments that can be used with the `date` command to manipulate and display dates and times. Some common options include `-d` to parse a date string, `--set` to set the system date, and various formatting options like `%Y-%m-%d` or `%H:%M:%S`. The detailed help message also includes examples for each option.'
        iso-8601: '[AI] The `date --iso-8601` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to display the current date and time in the International Standard ISO 8601 format. This format includes the year, month (with leading zero if necessary), day, hour, minute, second, and time zone information separated by hyphens or colons, depending on the specific representation chosen. For example, `2023-03-15T14:30:17Z` or `2023-03-15 14:30:17+02:00`.'
        reference: |-
            [AI] The `date --reference` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to set the system date based on a given reference date or time. The reference can be specified in various formats such as absolute dates (YYYY-MM-DD), relative dates (e.g., "yesterday" or "+1 week"), or specific time stamps. When used with no arguments, it displays the current system date and time along with the timezone information.

            For example: `date --reference="2023-03-15"` sets the system date to March 15, 2023; `date --reference="1 week ago"` sets the system date to one week before the current date.
        rfc-3339: '[AI] `date --rfc-3339` is a command in Unix-like operating systems, specifically the `date` utility, used to display or set the system date and time in the format defined by RFC 3339 (ISO 8601:2004). This format consists of 24 characters representing year-month-day'' hours:minutes:seconds''Z or year-month-day''T''hours'':minutes'':seconds''Z, where ''Z'' represents the time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and ''T'' separates date and time.'
        rfc-email: |-
            [AI] `date --rfc-email` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems, including GNU Date. The `--rfc-email` option generates a date output formatted according to the Rules for Representing Internet Message Headers format (RFC 5322). This includes the full date and time, followed by the UTC offset in the "ZZZZ" or "Z" format, and finally a timezone name if specified. For example, an output might look like:

            `Mon, 18 Jan 2021 09:30:05 +0100`

            This format is commonly used in email message headers.
        set: '[AI] The `date --set` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems used to set or modify the system date and time. It takes a specified date and time string as an argument, interprets it according to the given format, and sets the system date and time accordingly. For example: `date --set="2023-03-15 14:30:00"` sets the system date to March 15, 2023, at 2:30 PM. The command can also be used in scripts or interactively from the terminal to adjust the system clock.'
        universal: '[AI] The `date --universal` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to display the current date and time in ISO 8601 format, which includes the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second, all separated by T and Z, representing the time zone offset from UTC. For example, "2023-03-15T14:30:23Z" represents March 15, 2023 at 2:30 PM UTC.'
        utc,: |-
            [AI] `date --utc` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems to set or display the system date and time, using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) as the time zone reference instead of the local time zone. The UTC time represents the same time everywhere in the world, and it's essential for various network communications and applications that require consistent timekeeping.

            The command `date --utc [OPTION]...` sets or displays the system date and time based on UTC, with optional arguments to specify the new date/time value or to display additional information. For example:

            * To set the system date and time to a specific UTC value: `date --utc <YYYY-MM-DD> <HH>:<MM>:<SS>`
            * To display the current UTC date and time: `date --utc` or `date --utc +%F%T%z`

            Keep in mind that using UTC as the system time zone may require adjusting other settings, such as your local time zone or applications that rely on local time for user experience.
        version: '[AI] `date --version` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to display the version information of the `date` utility installed in the system. When executed, it prints out details such as the name of the utility, its version number, and sometimes additional information like compilation dates or other build details.'
