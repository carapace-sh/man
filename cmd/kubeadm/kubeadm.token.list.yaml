flags:
    --allow-missing-template-keys: If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
    --show-managed-fields: If true, keep the managedFields when printing objects in JSON or YAML format.
    -o, --experimental-output=: 'Output format. One of: text|json|yaml|go-template|go-template-file|template|templatefile|jsonpath|jsonpath-as-json|jsonpath-file.'
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm token list` command is used to display a list of tokens and their corresponding status in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. Tokens are used for authentication and authorization, allowing users or applications to access the cluster. Each line in the output represents a single token with fields such as token, ttl (time to live), and creation time.'
    flag:
        allow-missing-template-keys: '[AI] `kubeadm token list --allow-missing-template-keys` is a command used in Kubernetes to display the available tokens for authentication and authorization within a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. The `--allow-missing-template-keys` flag is an optional argument that allows the command to run even if some required template keys are missing from the kubelet''s configuration file (kubeletconfig). This can occur when using cloud provider''s authenticated nodes or other non-standard setups, where the kubeletconfig might not include all required template keys. By allowing missing template keys with this flag, you can avoid errors and still get a list of available tokens for those nodes.'
        experimental-output: '[AI] `kubeadm token list --experimental-output` is a command used in Kubernetes to list the available tokens for authentication and authorization. The `--experimental-output` flag is optional and enables an experimental output format that includes additional information such as the token''s creation time, renewal time, and whether it can be used for bootstrapping new cluster members. This can be useful for administrators managing complex Kubernetes clusters to easily identify and manage tokens with specific properties.'
        show-managed-fields: '[AI] `kubeadm token list --show-managed-fields` is a command used in Kubernetes to list out the tokens managed by kubeadm, along with their corresponding managed fields. Managed fields are the fields that are automatically managed and kept up-to-date by Kubernetes controllers, ensuring consistency across replicas and preventing accidental modification of critical configuration data. By using the `--show-managed-fields` option, you can see which fields in each token are being managed by kubeadm.'
