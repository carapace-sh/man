documentation:
    command: '[AI] `npm team create` is a command used in npm (Node Package Manager) to create a new npm team. This command registers a new team with npm, allowing members to publish packages under that team name and enabling collaboration features such as team-wide access control and package versioning. To use it, you need an active npm account and provide the required details like team name, email address, and optional team description during execution. The command returns a verification token which needs to be distributed among team members for them to join the team.'
