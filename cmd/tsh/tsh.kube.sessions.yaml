    command: '[AI] The `tsh kube sessions` command is used with Tenable.sc''s Kubernetes Security Hub (Tsh) to list active sessions for all users and processes connected to your Kubernetes clusters. It provides essential information such as usernames, process names, session start time, and the namespace where each session is running. By understanding these sessions, you can identify potential security risks, monitor normal activity, or investigate suspicious behavior within your Kubernetes environment.'
    flag:
        cluster: '[AI] The `kubectl tsh sessions --cluster` command is used to list the TSH (Telnet, SSH, and other secure shell) sessions connected to Kubernetes clusters managed by `kubectl`. It does not create or manage sessions, but rather provides information about existing sessions. This command can be useful for identifying which sessions are currently active and their corresponding pod names, nodes, and connection types. The output includes columns such as session ID, status, target, and start time.'
        format: '[AI] `kubectl tsh descriptions ''kube-sessions --format'': This command is used with the Kubernetes command-line tool (kubectl) to list information about active TTY and PTY (pseudo-terminal) sessions for running containers in a cluster. The `tsh` part stands for "toshshell," which is a utility for managing sessions in a Kubernetes cluster. The flag `--format` is used to customize the output format of the command.'
