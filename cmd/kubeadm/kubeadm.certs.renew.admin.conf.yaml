description: Renew the certificate embedded in the kubeconfig file for the admin to use and for kubeadm itself
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save the certificates
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubeconfig=: The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster.

    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm certs renew` command is used to renew the TLS certificates for the Kubernetes admin user located in the `admin.conf` file. This command is typically run when the existing certificates are about to expire, and you want to ensure that the cluster continues to function without interruption. When executed, `kubeadm` will generate new SSL/TLS certificates and private keys for the admin user, and update the corresponding configuration files accordingly.'

        cert-dir: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm certs renew` is a command used to renew TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm, which is an open-source project used for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters.

            The `--cert-dir` option specifies the directory where the original certificates are stored. This command automatically renews the certificates for various components like etcd, kube-apiserver, and kube-controller-manager. By renewing these certificates periodically, you ensure that your cluster remains secure as outdated or expiring certificates can compromise the security of your Kubernetes environment.
        config: |-
            [AI] The `kubeadm certs renew` command is used to renew TLS certificates for the Kubernetes administrative components such as the etcd, api-server, and control plane nodes in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm.

            The `--admin-config` flag specifies the path to the Kubernetes administration configuration file, which is usually located at `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf`. Renewing these certificates periodically ensures secure communication between the components and helps maintain a secure cluster environment.
        kubeconfig: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew` is a command used to renew the TLS certificates for the admin-user in Kubernetes clusters managed with Kubadm. The flag `--admin-config` specifies the path to the kubeconfig file, `admin.conf`, that contains the configuration for the admin user. By using this command, you ensure that the SSL/TLS certificates used for secure communication between components of your Kubernetes cluster remain up-to-date and valid.'
