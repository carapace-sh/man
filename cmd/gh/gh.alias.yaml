documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `gh alias` command is used with GitHub''s official Git CLI tool, gh, to create or manage aliases for Git commands. Aliases can help simplify and customize frequently used Git workflows. For example, you could set up an alias for a common branch name like `main` or `master`, or for a complex command sequence. To use the command, simply write `gh alias [name] [command]`, where `[name]` is the desired alias name and `[command]` is the Git command or series of commands to be aliased. For instance, `gh alias main checkout create origin/main` would create an alias named "main" that automatically checks out and creates a new local branch based on the provided remote branch.'
