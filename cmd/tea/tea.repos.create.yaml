documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea repos create` command is used in Tectonic, an open-source Kubernetes platform by CoreOS, to create a new Git or GitHub repository for a Helm chart. This command generates the necessary files and directories for a basic Helm chart structure within the specified directory, including a `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, `templates` folder, and other essential configuration files.'
    flag:
        branch: '[AI] The `tea repos create --branch` command is a Git extension using the Tea-VM tool, which creates a new repository with an initial branch. It sets up a new Git repository locally and creates a new branch off of the specified base branch or mainline for version control management. This is useful when starting a new project from a template or when creating a new feature branch to work on.'
        description: '[AI] The `tea repos create` command with the `--description` option is used in the Tectonic (now called Rancher Tekton) workflow management system to create a new GitOps repository. The `--description` flag provides a brief description for the newly created repository. This helps in maintaining clear and meaningful names for repositories in your GitOps workflow setup.'
        gitignores: '[AI] The `tea repos create --gitignores` command is used in the Teapot repository manager for Git. This command creates a new Git repository and includes a `.gitignore` file by default. A `.gitignore` file is used to specify which files or directories should be ignored by Git, preventing them from being tracked or committed unintentionally. In summary, this command sets up a new Git repository with a preconfigured `.gitignore` file.'
        init: '[AI] `tea repos create --init` is a command used in the TeaDB database management system. This command creates a new repository with an initial Git configuration. TeaDB uses Git for version control of its repositories. When you run this command, it creates a new directory with the specified name and initializes both a TeaDB repository and a Git repository within that directory.'
        labels: '[AI] The `tea repos create --labels` command is a part of the Temporal workflow orchestrator''s (Tea) CLI (Command Line Interface). This command creates a new GitOps repository using Tea, and sets custom labels for it. Labels are key-value pairs that can be used to categorize or filter repositories based on specific criteria, making it easier to manage multiple repositories. The exact format of the command would be `tea repos create [REPO_NAME] --labels KEY=VALUE,KEY=VALUE`.'
        license: '[AI] `tea repos create --license` is a command used in the Teapot CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for GitHub projects managed with the Terraform cloud. This command creates a new repository in the Teapot registry, specifically setting up a .gitignore file and applying a chosen license template to the initial project files. The --license option specifies which open-source license to use. It streamlines the process of creating a new GitHub project with proper setup for version control and open-source licensing.'
        login: '[AI] The command `tea repos create --login` is used with the Tea API, a GitOps tool for managing Kubernetes clusters. This command creates a new repository within Tea''s GitOps system. The `--login` flag indicates that this repository will be connected to an external Git provider, allowing you to push and pull changes using standard Git workflows.'
        name: '[AI] `tea repos create --name` is a command used in the Teapot version control system. It creates a new repository with the specified name. When executed, it initializes an empty Git-based repository and sets up the given name as its identifier. This command is helpful for users who want to create a new project or start a new version control workflow.'
        output: '[AI] `tea repos create --output` is a command in the Tectonic (now Draft) open-source Kubernetes platform by Google. The command creates a new repository in the Tectonic Registry or other supported registries. The `--output` flag specifies the output format for the command response, typically in YAML or JSON format, to facilitate further processing or integration with other tools.'
        owner: '[AI] `tea repos create --owner` is a command used in the TeaGUI (Tea Graphical User Interface) for GitHub package manager. This command creates a new repository within your Tea account with the specified owner name. The --owner flag indicates that you are creating a new repository under that specific owner account.'
        private: '[AI] The command `tea repos create --private` is used with the Teaspoon CLI (Command Line Interface) in the Teaspoon version control system for Docker images. This command creates a new private repository in Teaspoon Registry for storing and managing Docker images. The `--private` flag indicates that this repository will have restricted access, meaning only authenticated users with proper permissions can pull or push images to it.'
        readme: '[AI] The `tea` command is a part of the Teapot Terraform plugin for GitHub. `tea repos create --readme` is a sub-command used to create a new repository in GitHub and set the README file at the same time. This is often used when setting up a new project, where you want to initialize your GitHub repository along with adding a brief description of your project in the README file. The `--readme` flag sets the contents for this file from the given argument or from the standard input.'
        template: '[AI] The `tea repos create --template` command is used in the Teapot CLI (Command Line Interface) for GitHub''s Terraform modules. This command creates a new repository template within Teapot, which serves as a starting point for creating new Terraform projects with consistent structure and configuration. The `--template` flag specifies the name of an existing repository or a path to a local directory containing the desired template files. This command assists in enforcing best practices, promoting consistency across teams, and simplifying the process of creating new Terraform projects.'
        trustmodel: '[AI] `tea repos create --trustmodel` is a command used in the Temporal workflow engine to create a new repository with a trust model. A trust model defines the access control policies for an organization''s workflows and tasks. With this command, you can create a new repository with predefined access control settings that allow or deny certain actions based on specific roles or groups. This command simplifies managing access control within your Temporal workflow engine by automating the creation of repositories with consistent trust models.'
