name: stop
description: Halt the background maintenance schedule
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `git maintenance` is not a standard Git command. There seems to be some confusion here as Git does not have a built-in command named `stop`. If you meant a specific Git workflow like GitFlow or GitMaintenance, these are extensions that provide `maintenance` commands for creating and managing maintenance branches. To clarify, there isn''t a "git maintenance stop" command in Git itself.'
