documentation:
    command: '[AI] `egrep` is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems for performing regular expression pattern matching on text files. The name "egrep" is short for "extended grep," as it extends the functionality of the basic "grep" (Global Regular Expression Print) command by providing additional features like support for extended regular expressions, and the ability to process multiple files at once using the `-m` or `--multi-file` option.'
