documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl try-restart` is a command used in systemd-based Linux distributions to safely restart a specific service or reboot the entire system if only one service requires it, without disrupting the running user sessions or other services unnecessarily. This command first enters the target runlevel into "pre-restart" state for the affected service(s), then checks if it can be stopped cleanly; if so, it will be stopped and started again. If not, systemctl will attempt to reboot the system instead. The result of the operation is reported, but no actual system change is made until the user confirms to proceed. This command provides a safe way to ensure that services are properly restarted or that necessary changes can be made without disrupting ongoing operations.'
