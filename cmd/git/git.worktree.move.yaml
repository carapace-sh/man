documentation:
    command: |-
        [AI] `git worktree move` is a Git command used to rename or move an existing local Git working directory under a new path, while keeping the current branch and history intact. The syntax is:

        ```bash
        git worktree move <new-location> <branch-name>
        ```

        Replace `<new-location>` with the desired new path to move or rename the working directory and `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch in that working directory. This command updates the current working directory to the new location as well, making it convenient for developers to manage multiple working directories within a project easily.
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `git worktree move --force` is a Git command used to move an existing Git work-tree to a new location in the file system while overwriting any existing content in that location. The `--force` option is used when you want to move the work-tree without prompting for confirmation or if there are conflicting changes between the source and target directories. This command doesn''t affect the Git history, it only modifies the working directory associated with a particular branch or commit in your repository.'
