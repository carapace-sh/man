    command: '[AI] `git request-pull` is a Git command used to initiate a pull request from a remote repository into your local one. It fetches the latest changes, merges them into a new branch, and opens an editor where you can review and commit the merge. Once committed, it creates a new branch in your local repository with the changes ready to be pushed as a pull request to the remote repository. This command is useful for contributing changes back to upstream projects.'
    flag:
        p: '[AI] `git request-pull` is a Git command used to fetch and apply a pull request from a remote repository into your local one. The `-p` flag, short for `--patch`, instructs Git to apply the changes in the pull request as patches, allowing you to manually review each change before committing them to your local branch. This can be useful when dealing with complex or sensitive changes, giving you greater control over what gets merged into your project.'
