    command: '[AI] `circleci orb publish promote` is a CircleCI Orb (Open Source Browser Extension) command used to publish an Orb to the CircleCI Orbs registry and then promote it to make it available for use in CircleCI workflows. This command assumes that you have already built and packaged your Orb, and it''s located in the `.circleci/orbs` directory within your project repository. By running this command, you''re essentially uploading your Orb to the registry and marking it as a promoted version (stable and recommended for use) for other CircleCI users.'
