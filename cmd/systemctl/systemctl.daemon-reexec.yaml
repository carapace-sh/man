        [AI] The `systemctl daemon-reload`, `systemctl enable` or `systemctl start` commands are commonly used to manage systemd services in Linux systems.

        The `systemctl daemon-reexec` command is less commonly used, but it has an important role in the systemd ecosystem. This command causes the systemd daemon to reload all configured units and then restart any services that have been marked for restart or are set up to start on boot. It essentially forces a daemon reload and service restart without requiring separate commands for each. This can be useful when making changes to system configurations, such as new service files, and wanting the changes to take effect immediately.
