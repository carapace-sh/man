description: Enable the necessary sparse-checkout config settings
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git sparse-checkout set` is a Git command used to configure and manage a sparse checkout, which allows for selective file checking out in a Git repository. With this command, you can specify a list of paths or directories to include in the working directory while excluding others, reducing the size of the checked-out codebase. The main usage is: `git sparse-checkout set <pathspec>...`, where `<pathspec>` represents one or more Git-recognized path specifications. This command sets the current branch to a sparse checkout with the specified paths and removes any existing exclusions.'
