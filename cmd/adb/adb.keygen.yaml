description: generate adb public/private key
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) command "keygen" is used to generate a new cryptographic key for authenticating Android debugging connections between an Android device and a development environment, such as the Android Studio IDE or the command line. This key pair consists of a public key stored on the device and a private key kept by the developer. When enabling USB debugging on the device, the user can specify the path to this generated key file, allowing for more secure debugging sessions.'
