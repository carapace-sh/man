documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `seq` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems for generating and printing sequences of numbers. Its syntax is `seq [START] [END] [INCREMENT]`, where `START` represents the initial number, `END` represents the final number, and `INCREMENT` represents the difference between consecutive numbers (default is 1). For example, `seq 1 5` would print `1 2 3 4 5`.'
    flag:
        equal-width: '[AI] `seq --equal-width` is a command in Unix-like operating systems, specifically part of the GNU Core Utilities package. It generates a sequence of numbers or other text, and the `--equal-width` option ensures that all output lines have the same width. This means that when generating a sequence of numbers, each line will contain the same number of digits, with leading zeros added as necessary to maintain the specified width. The flag improves the appearance of output by ensuring symmetry in column widths.'
        format: '[AI] `seq --format` is a command in the GNU `seq` utility, which generates a sequence of numbers. The `--format` option allows users to customize the output format of these numbers using a printf-style syntax. For example, `seq --format="%2d" 1 10` will generate the numbers from 1 to 10 with each number formatted and padded to a minimum width of 2 with leading zeros. This can be useful for creating structured output for various applications.'
        help: '[AI] `seq --help` is a command in Unix-like operating systems that generates a sequence of numbers. The help option (--help) displays detailed information about how to use the seq command, including available options, examples, and usage. It provides instructions on how to generate a sequence of numbers within a specified range or with defined steps.'
        separator: '[AI] The `seq` command with the option `--separator` in Unix-based systems generates a sequence of numbers or text followed by the specified separator character between each item when used in a pipeline or redirection output. For example, `seq 1 5 --separator="*" > output.txt` will generate an output file named `output.txt` with the sequence "1*\*2*\*3*\*4*\*5".'
        version: '[AI] The `seq --version` command is used to display the version information of the seq utility, which is a common Unix command for generating sequences of numbers. When executed in a Unix-like terminal or shell, it prints out the version number and other relevant details such as compilation date, operating system, and sometimes the author or maintainer of the software. The output usually looks like `seq (GNU coreutils) 8.30`, indicating that the seq command is part of the GNU Core Utilities package and its current version is 8.30.'
