documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh codespace edit` is a GitHub command used to create or enter an interactive coding environment, called a "codespace," directly in GitHub''s web interface. This command allows developers to write and test code with pre-installed tools and dependencies without having to set up a local development environment first. The codespace can be edited using your preferred code editor, which is launched within the GitHub interface itself. Changes made inside the codespace are automatically saved and synced back to the GitHub repository.'
    flag:
        display-name: '[AI] `gh codespace edit` is a GitHub command used to create or update a GitHub Codespace, an isolated development environment for your GitHub project. The `--display-name` option sets a custom name for the codespace that will be visible in the GitHub interface when selecting which codespace to use. It helps in identifying and managing multiple codespaces associated with the same repository easily.'
        displayName: '[AI] The `gh codespace edit` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for creating and managing editable environments, or "codespaces," for your GitHub repositories. The `--displayName` option allows you to set a custom name for the codespace when it''s created. This can help you easily identify and manage different codespaces within the same repository. In summary, this command creates an editable environment in a GitHub repository and sets a custom display name for it using the provided argument.'
        machine: '[AI] `gh codespace edit --machine` is a command used with GitHub''s Codespaces, which is a feature that lets you write and run code directly in the cloud. This specific command creates or enters an existing codespace and sets it up to run on a pre-configured machine image instead of using a container. It allows running complex development environments, like those requiring heavy resource usage or specific software installations, more efficiently.'
