    command: '[AI] `nohup` is a Linux utility command used to run commands that can continue running in the background even if the terminal window or SSH connection is disconnected. The `nohup` command does this by appending the output of the command to a file named `nohup.out` in the current directory, allowing the command to be detached from the terminal. To use `nohup`, simply type `nohup` followed by the command you want to run in the terminal and press Enter. For example: `nohup python script.py`.'

            [AI] `nohup` is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems. Its primary function is to run a given command as a background process, allowing it to continue running even if the user logs out or the terminal window is closed.

            The `--version` option is used with `nohup` to display its version information. When you type `nohup --version` in your terminal, it will output the version number and other relevant details about the installed version of `nohup`, such as the compilation date, operating system, and any additional features or options supported by that particular installation.
