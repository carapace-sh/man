documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker buildx create` is a command used with Docker Buildx, an extension of Docker that adds support for building multi-stage images using multiple buildx contexts on a single machine or across multiple machines. The command creates a new buildx context, which is a separate environment configured with specific build settings such as Docker versions, CPU and memory resources, and other options. This command sets up the infrastructure for building images in an isolated manner within the new context.'
    flag:
        append: '[AI] `docker buildx create --append` is a command used with Docker Buildx, an extension of Docker that enables building and testing multi-context Docker images using multiple buildx buildslaves. The `--append` flag is used to append a new buildx context (a set of build slaves, cache and artifacts) to an existing one instead of creating a new one from scratch. This allows for incrementally expanding the capabilities of an existing buildx context.'
        bootstrap: '[AI] `docker buildx create --bootstrap` is a command used to create a new Docker Buildx environment, which is an extension of Docker that enables building and testing multi-stage Docker images using multiple buildx contexts (each with its own Dockerfile, cache, and other settings). The `--bootstrap` flag initializes the new buildx environment by downloading and installing the necessary components including the Docker Desktop container runtime, Docker Engine, and the Buildx component itself. This command sets up a self-contained environment for building Docker images with improved security and isolation.'
        buildkitd-flags: '[AI] `docker buildx create` is a command used in Docker to install and manage Buildx, an extension of the Docker Builder engine that enables building containers using multiple nodes or workers in a cluster. The `--buildkitd-flags` option is used to pass custom flags directly to the underlying buildkitd daemon, which manages the build process across multiple nodes. This can be useful for configuring various aspects of the build process such as network settings, resource limits, or logging options. For example, you might use `--buildkitd-flags "flag1=value1 flag2=value2"` to set specific flags during installation or update of Buildx.'
        config: '[AI] `docker buildx create` is a command used in Docker to install and configure a new buildx context. A buildx context is a collection of builds, caches, and other resources that can be shared across multiple machines or projects. The `--config` option allows you to specify a YAML file containing custom configurations for the new context. For example, you might use this to set up a multi-stage build or configure access to remote Docker registries.'
        driver: '[AI] `docker buildx create` is a command used to create a new Docker Buildx driver within Docker. Buildx is an extension of the standard Docker build system, enabling multi-stage builds and other advanced features across multiple nodes or clouds. The `--driver` option specifies which type of builder to create, such as `docker-container`, `docker-machine`, or `docker-compose`. For example, `docker buildx create --driver docker-container` creates a new driver for building images using Docker containers as build workers.'
        driver-opt: '[AI] `docker buildx create` is a command used to create a new Docker Buildx driver, which is an extension of Docker Engine for building images using multiple nodes or clouds. The `--driver-opt` flag is used to pass specific options to the chosen builder driver. For example, if you''re creating a new buildx driver using the Amazon ECR-Docker builder, you might use `--driver-opt=region=us-west-2`. This option sets the default AWS region for the driver, making it easier to build images with that specific region context.'
        leave: '[AI] `docker buildx create --leave` is a command used with Docker Buildx, which is an extension of Docker for building and producing production-ready images using multiple buildx contexts. This command creates a new buildx context, but does not start it. The `--leave` flag means that after the context creation, Buildx will not automatically start it. Instead, it remains in a created state until manually started later.'
        name: '[AI] `docker buildx create` is a command used to create a new Docker Buildx context in Docker Engine. The `--name` option allows you to specify a custom name for the new context. Buildx is an extension of Docker that enables building multi-context projects and allows using multiple builders and distributing the build workload across multiple workers. Creating a new context with a specific name helps manage and keep track of different builds within your organization or team.'
        node: '[AI] `docker buildx create --node` is a command used to create a new Docker Buildx node in a swarm cluster. Buildx is an extension of Docker that enables building multi-stage images using multiple nodes or workers in a swarm environment. The `--node` flag specifies that a new node will be added to the existing Buildx cluster. When executed, this command installs Docker and necessary components on the target node and registers it as a worker in the Buildx cluster for building Docker images.'
        platform: '[AI] `docker buildx create --platform` is a command used to create a new Docker Buildx builder context with specified platforms for building and testing multi-arch Docker images. Buildx is an extension of Docker that enables the ability to build, test, save and share multi-stage builds, as well as manage multiple builds in parallel. This command allows you to define the target architectures (platforms) for your build, such as `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64` or `windows/amd64`. By creating a builder context with multiple platforms, you can build and test your images for different architectures in one go.'
        use: '[AI] `docker buildx create --use` is a command used to create and apply a new Docker Buildx builder, which extends the standard Docker engine capabilities for building multi-context images using multiple buildx builders. The `--use` flag makes the newly created builder active and sets it as the default builder for Docker.'
