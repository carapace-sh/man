    command: '[AI] `lsblk` is a Linux command used to list block devices and their associated mount points. It provides a human-readable output of block devices, their sizes, types, and mount points if any. This command is useful for quickly checking the available storage devices and their status in a system without having to manually navigate directories or parse complex outputs.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `lsblk --all` is a Linux command used to list block devices and their associated mount points, size, type, and other relevant information. The `--all` option shows detailed information for all available block devices. It provides an output in a tree-like format, which visually illustrates the hierarchical relationship between parent and child block devices.'
        ascii: '[AI] `lsblk --ascii` is a command used in Linux to display block device information in a raw, tabular format with columns for name, type, size, and other attributes. The `--ascii` option ensures that the output is plain text, making it easy to parse or redirect to another tool for further processing. Each line of output corresponds to a block device, providing details such as its major and minor numbers, mount point, label, and more. This command is often used in scripts for automated system administration tasks.'
        bytes: '[AI] `lsblk --bytes` is a command used in Linux systems to list block devices and their respective sizes in bytes. The `--bytes` option specifically requests that output be displayed in bytes instead of the default human-readable format (KB, MB, etc.). This can be useful for scripts or situations where precise byte counts are required.'
        dedup: '[AI] `lsblk --dedup` is a Linux command used to list block devices and their available properties. The `--dedup` option specifically displays information about deduplicated data, which is data that is stored only once and referenced multiple times to save disk space. This command helps identify which block devices have deduplication enabled and how much space is saved through this feature.'
        discard: '[AI] The `lsblk --discard` command is a Linux utility used to list block devices and their associated mount points, with an added option to display information related to discard or trim support. Discard or Trim is a feature that allows the operating system to notify the storage device to discard or overwrite deleted blocks, which can help optimize performance for certain workloads, such as databases or file systems with a lot of deletions. This option should only be used on devices that support this feature and have been properly configured to allow it.'
        exclude: '[AI] `lsblk` is a Linux command used to list block devices and their corresponding mount points. The `--exclude` option allows you to exclude specific block devices from the output by providing a pattern or device name. For example, `lsblk --exclude sda` will exclude the device named "sda" from the output. Multiple exclusions can be specified using `--exclude={pattern1,pattern2}`. This option is useful when you want to filter out specific devices and focus on a particular subset of block devices.'
        fs: '[AI] The `lsblk --fs` command is used in Linux systems to list block devices along with their file system types and mount points. The `--fs` option makes `lsblk` display not only the device name, but also the filesystem label, type, size, and mounted filesystem information (if applicable). It provides a quick and simple way to check the file system status of your block devices.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `lsblk` is a Linux command used to list block devices and their associated mount points. The `--help` option provides a concise summary of its usage and available options. Here's a brief explanation:

            - `--help` or `-h`: Displays a help message that includes available options and their short descriptions.
            - Block devices are storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, partitions, CD/DVD drives, etc.
            - `lsblk` by default lists block devices, their sizes, mount points, and types (e.g., disk, partition, loop device).
            - Additional options include:
              - `--all` or `-a`: Shows all block devices, not just the ones currently mounted.
              - `--output=<KEY>...`: Lists only the specified output keys for each block device. Multiple keys can be separated by commas. Examples: `--output=NAME,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT`.
              - `--noheadings` or `-N`: Suppresses column headings when using `--output` option.
              - `--path` or `-P`: Displays the absolute path of each block device instead of its name.
              - `--tree`: Shows a tree diagram of the block devices' hierarchy (useful for complex systems).
              - `--nodes`: Prints node information (dev, parent, type, and label) for each block device in the tree.
        include: '[AI] `lsblk --include` is a command used in Linux to list block devices and their associated information. The `--include` option specifies which specific columns or attributes to display. This allows for customization of the output, showing only the desired information. For example, `--include NAME,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT` would show the device name, size, type, and mount point.'
        inverse: '[AI] The `lsblk --inverse` command is a Linux utility used to list block devices and their associated mount points, file systems, and other information. The `--inverse` option inverts the output format, meaning that instead of displaying mount points under their corresponding block devices, it shows block devices under their respective mount points. This can be useful when working with complex system configurations where multiple mount points exist for a single block device.'
        json: '[AI] `lsblk --json` is a Linux command used to display block device information in JSON format. It provides a machine-readable output that can be easily parsed and processed by scripts or other programs. The JSON output includes details such as name, major and minor numbers, size, label, and mountpoint of each block device.'
        list: '[AI] `lsblk --list` is a Linux command used to display block device information in a tree structure format. It shows the hierarchy of block devices, their sizes, types, and mount points. The output includes columns for name, major and minor numbers, size, usage, and label. This command provides a clear view of the system''s block devices organization without the need to parse complex output from other commands like `fdisk` or `parted`.'
        merge: '[AI] `lsblk --merge` is a Linux command used to display block device and their mount points in a human-readable format. The `--merge` option merges output of multiple blocks into a single line, making it easier to parse the output programmatically or use it as input for further processing. Essentially, this command makes the output more compact by combining information about each block device and its mount point into a single line.'
        nodeps: '[AI] `lsblk --nodeps` is a Linux command used to list block devices and their associated mount points, as well as the hierarchy of their dependencies. The `--nodeps` option suppresses the display of nodes without children (i.e., devices that are not parents of any other devices). This can help simplify the output and make it easier to understand the relationships between different block devices in your system. The main columns displayed are `NAME`, `MAJ:MIN`, `RMB`, `SIZE`, and `MOUNTPOINT`. Additionally, the dependencies are shown as indented child columns under their parent devices.'
        noheadings: '[AI] `lsblk --noheadings` is a Linux command used to list block devices and their associated mount points without displaying column headers. The `--noheadings` option suppresses the printing of column headers, resulting in only data being displayed. Each line represents a block device with columns showing the major and minor numbers, size, label, mount point, and type (e.g., disk or partition).'
        output: '[AI] `lsblk --output` is a Linux command used to list block devices and their corresponding mount points with some specific output. The `--output` option allows specifying which columns or attributes should be displayed, such as `name`, `major`, `minor`, `size`, `mountpoint`, `label`, etc. This can be useful for scripting and automation tasks where you want to extract specific information about block devices.'
        output-all: '[AI] `lsblk --output-all` is a Linux command used to list block devices and their associated information. The `--output-all` option instructs the command to display all available columns of output, providing a comprehensive view of each device''s attributes such as name, size, type, vendor, model, and mountpoint among others. This information can be helpful for system administration tasks like identifying and managing storage devices.'
        pairs: '[AI] `lsblk --pairs` is a command from the Linux block I/O subsystem utilities. It''s used to display a list of block devices, their mount points, and the relationships between them in a human-readable format, represented as key-value pairs. Each line corresponds to a device, showing device name, major and minor numbers, RAID status, and parent-child relationships if applicable. The output is designed for parsing by scripts rather than human consumption.'
        paths: '[AI] `lsblk --paths` is a command used in Linux systems to display block device information with the output including the device paths from the root directory. The `--paths` option specifically requests that each device''s file system hierarchy be displayed, providing the full path to the mount point for each device. This can be useful for understanding the relationships between various storage devices and file systems in your system.'
        perms: '[AI] `lsblk --perms` is a command used in Linux to display block device information with an extra column showing the ownership and permissions for each device. The output includes columns for name, type, size, label, mountpoint, and owner-permissions. This option helps users quickly check the file system access rights of various block devices, which can be crucial for managing and troubleshooting storage configurations.'
        raw: '[AI] `lsblk --raw` is a command used in Linux systems to display detailed block device information in a raw format. The option `--raw` instructs `lsblk` to output data without any column labels or formatting, making it ideal for parsing the output programmatically using scripts. Each row in the output represents a single block device and provides columns such as major number, minor number, name, size, and mountpoint (if applicable).'
        scsi: '[AI] `lsblk --scsi` is a Linux command used to list block devices and their associated SCSI or Block Storage Device interfaces. It provides detailed information such as device name, size, type, and connection details (e.g., vendor, model). The `--scsi` option filters the output to only show devices connected via SCSI or SAS interfaces. It is particularly useful for administrators working with storage systems like RAID arrays, iSCSI targets, or fiber channel hosts.'
        sort: '[AI] `lsblk --sort` is a command used in Linux to list block devices and their associated mount points, along with various other information like size, type, and label. The `--sort` option tells the command to sort the output based on a specific column. For example, `--sort size` would display the devices ordered by their size from largest to smallest. Other valid sorts include `name`, `type`, or `label`.'
        sysroot: '[AI] The `lsblk --sysroot` command is a Linux utility used to list block devices and their associated mount points. The `--sysroot` option specifies that the output should be based on the root file system of the system, rather than the current working directory. This can be useful when working with multiple file systems or when debugging system issues. The output includes device name, size, type, mountpoint, and other relevant information.'
        topology: '[AI] The `lsblk --topology` command is a Linux utility used to list block devices and their attachment points, I/O characteristics, and topological information. The `--topology` option displays the hierarchical relationship between block devices, showing parents and children in a tree structure. This information can be useful for understanding the storage layout of a system and troubleshooting issues related to block devices.'
        tree: '[AI] `lsblk --tree` is a command used in Linux to display a hierarchical tree representation of block devices and their mount points. The output shows the device name, size, type (e.g., disk or partition), and the mount point if applicable. Each parent device is indicated by a ''+'' symbol followed by its child device(s). This command helps in understanding the block device hierarchy, making it useful for system administration tasks such as managing file systems and partitions.'
        version: '[AI] `lsblk` is a Linux command-line utility for listing block devices and their mount points.
