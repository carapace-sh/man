documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `brew` command is not a valid command in Homebrew, which is a popular package manager for macOS. There''s no `cat` sub-command within Homebrew. If you meant to use `cat` as a standalone command for displaying the content of a file, then there''s nothing related to Homebrew in that scenario. The `cat` command itself stands for "concatenate" and is a standard utility in Unix-based operating systems, used to view or concatenate files in the terminal.'
    flag:
        cask: '[AI] `brew cask` is a command-line tool provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The command `brew install` is used to install software packages from the standard Homebrew repository, while `brew cask` installs software packaged as Casks, which are larger, self-contained packages that include not only the application but also additional dependencies and configuration files. The `--cask` flag specifically tells Homebrew to use the Cask repository instead of the default one for installation.'
        debug: '[AI] The command `brew cat --debug` is not a valid flag combination for Homebrew, which is a popular package manager for macOS. Each argument in a Homebrew command should be either a distinct command or an option with its corresponding value. In this case, "--debug" is a valid argument for enabling debug mode for Homebrew commands, but "brew cat" is not a recognized command within Homebrew''s context. To enable debug mode when installing a package, use `brew install --debug` instead.'
        formula: '[AI] `brew cat --formula` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `cat` part of the command stands for "concatenate," which means it will display the contents of a file. The `--formula` option specifies that the file to be displayed is the formula for a specific Homebrew package. When you run `brew cat --formula <package-name>`, it will show you the details and instructions required to build and install that package, including dependencies, scripts, and other relevant information.'
        help: '[AI] The command `brew help cat` in Homebrew (a package manager for macOS) displays detailed help information about using the `cat` utility with Homebrew. This includes how to install, update, or remove `cat`, as well as examples of how to use it for various tasks such as viewing file content or concatenating files. The flag `--help` is used to request this detailed help information.'
        quiet: '[AI] The command `brew cat --quiet` is not a valid flag combination for Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--quiet` flag is used to suppress informational output during Homebrew''s installation or updating processes. However, the `cat` command is not related to Homebrew flags and is typically used in the terminal to display the content of files. If you intended to use the `--quiet` flag with a different Homebrew command or to combine it with the `cat` command, ensure that both commands are properly written and used in context.'
        verbose: '[AI] The command `brew cats --verbose` is not a valid flag or command in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This combination does not exist within Homebrew''s ecosystem. To use Homebrew effectively, make sure to check the available commands and their proper usage with `brew help`.'
