documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vercel billing set-default` command is used in the Vercel platform to manage your billing information. Specifically, it sets the default payment method for your account. When you run this command in your terminal, you will be prompted to provide the details of your preferred payment method, such as the card number, expiration date, and security code. Once provided, Vercel will save these details as the default payment method for your account. This means that when you are billed for your Vercel services, this payment method will be automatically charged.'
