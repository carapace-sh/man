    command: '[AI] `git http-backend` is a Git daemon that runs as an HTTP server to enable pushing and pulling Git repositories over the HTTP protocol without the need for SSH access. It''s typically used in environments where firewall restrictions limit or prevent SSH usage, such as corporate networks. This command can be used to start the daemon in the background on Unix-based systems. Once started, clients can connect and interact with Git repositories using standard HTTP requests.'
