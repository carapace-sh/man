documentation:
    command: '[AI] `cfdisk` is a text-based disk partitioning tool commonly used in Linux systems for creating, deleting, and managing file system partitions. It provides a simple, interactive menu to help users configure their storage layout. Users can select a device, create new partitions, set their sizes and file systems, and mark them as active or primary/extended. Changes are then written to the disk once the user confirms the configuration. Note that using `cfdisk` requires caution, as incorrect usage may result in data loss.'
    flag:
        color: '[AI] `cfdisk --color` is a command used in Linux to create and manipulate partition tables, specifically with the cfdisk text-based utility. The `--color` option enables colored output for improved readability and easier identification of different partition types. This can make working with multiple partitions or complex disk configurations more efficient and less error-prone.'
        help: '[AI] `cfdisk` is a text-based disk partitioning tool commonly used in Linux systems. The `--help` option, when run with `cfdisk`, displays comprehensive usage information and available command keys. It provides details on how to create, delete, modify, and list partitions using the CFDisk utility. This helps users understand the functionality of the command for effective partition management.'
        lock: '[AI] The `cfdisk --lock` command is used with the CFDISK disk partitioning utility to acquire a write lock on a partition table file, preventing other processes from making changes concurrently. This helps ensure data consistency and avoid conflicts when multiple processes attempt to modify the same partition table at the same time. By using the `--lock` option, cfdisk will create a flock file upon acquisition of the lock and release it upon exit.'
        version: '[AI] `cfdisk --version` is a command used in Linux and Unix-like operating systems to display the version information of the CFDISK utility, which is a text-based disk partitioning tool. When executed with this argument, it prints out details such as the name, version number, and sometimes additional information like the compiler or build date. This can be helpful for system administrators to keep track of installed software versions.'
        zero: '[AI] `cfdisk --zero` is a command used in Linux to initialize a new partition or clear an existing one, marking it as unallocated space. The `--zero` option sets all sectors of the partition to zero, effectively erasing any data present. This can be useful when preparing a disk or partition for reuse, or when creating a new partition table. However, be aware that this operation irreversibly destroys data and should only be used after carefully considering its consequences.'
