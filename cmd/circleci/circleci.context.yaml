        [AI] The `circleci context` command is not a standard CircleCI command, as there seems to be no such command documented in CircleCI's official documentation. It might be a custom or misused command. If you intended to use the `circlci config` or `circleci setup` commands, here's what they do:

        - `circleci config`: This command displays and sets up your CircleCI configuration file (`.circleci/config.yml`). It is typically used to create a new configuration file or modify an existing one.

        - `circleci setup`: This command initializes and sets up a new project for CircleCI. It downloads the necessary tools, creates the necessary directory structure, and sets up a GitHub Webhook to trigger builds automatically when you push changes to your repository.
