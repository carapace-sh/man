    command: '[AI] `gh project view` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to open a project in the GitHub Desktop or Atom text editor.

This command streamlines the process of opening projects directly from the terminal without having to navigate through multiple directories manually.'
    flag:
        format: '[AI] `gh project view --format` is a command used in the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, `gh`. This command is used to retrieve project details from GitHub, and the `--format` option specifies how the output should be formatted. It allows users to customize the output by defining a template with placeholders that will be replaced by the actual data when the command is executed. The result can then be easily processed further using other tools or scripts.'
        jq: '[AI] `gh project view` is a command used in the GitHub CLI (github-cli) to view details of a specific GitHub project. The `--jq` option is used to apply JSON queries using the jq language after the output of the `gh project view` command.

        owner: '[AI] `gh project view --owner` is a command used in GitHub''s `gh` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. It''s specifically designed to display details about the ownership of a given GitHub project. The command takes no arguments beyond the basic `project view` subcommand, and its primary output includes information such as the project owner''s username or email address, and the organization (if applicable). This command helps users quickly identify the current ownership structure for a specific GitHub project, making it useful in various collaboration scenarios.'
        template: '[AI] The `gh project view --template` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to generate a new project in GitHub using a specific template. The "--template" option specifies the template to be used as the basis for the new project. When you run this command, GitHub will create a new repository based on the chosen template and set up a new local directory with the necessary files and structure for the project. This can save time and effort by providing a solid starting point for your project.'
        web: '[AI] `gh project view --web` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to open a web browser and display the specified GitHub project or repository in it. The `--web` flag indicates that the output should be opened in a web browser instead of the terminal. This can be useful for quickly accessing a project''s files or code directly from the command line.'
