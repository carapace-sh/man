documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flatpak config` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager system. It allows users to view and modify various configuration settings related to Flatpak. These settings can include things like the base system image used for building flatpaks, the location of the Flathub repository (the default remote for installing applications), and other advanced options. Users can use `flatpak config --list` to display a list of available configuration keys and their current values. To change a specific setting, users can use the syntax `flatpak config <key> <value>`. For example, `flatpak config --set remote.flathub.enabled true` would enable the Flathub remote.'
    flag:
        get: '[AI] `flatpak config --get` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager system for Linux distributions. This command retrieves the value of a specific configuration key from the Flatpak runtime or application. For instance, you can use it to check the current value of a particular environment variable set for a specific application or runtime, such as `flatpak config --get <runtime_or_app> env:MYVAR`. The output will display the value associated with the given configuration key.'
        help: '[AI] `flatpak config --help` is a command used in the Flatpak packaging system to display help information about the configuration sub-command. It allows users to view available options for configuring various aspects of their Flatpak installation, such as setting up repositories, managing keys, and adjusting global settings. The output includes detailed explanations for each option and its default value or required arguments.'
        installation: |-
            [AI] `flatpak config --installation` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to configure where applications and their data are installed on a Linux system.

            The command sets the installation mode for Flatpaks, which can be set to one of three values: "global" (default), "per-user", or "per-appfolder".

            * "Global": Installs applications system-wide, available to all users.
            * "Per-user": Installs applications only for the current user, keeping them separate from other users.
            * "Per-appfolder": Installs applications in individual app folders for each application, allowing fine-grained control over their locations and data.

            Using this command helps ensure that Flatpak installations are kept organized, isolated, and secure according to the desired configuration.
        list: '[AI] `flatpak config --list` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to list the current configurations for various settings. These settings can include things like the default branch for updating repositories, the location of the data and cache directories, or the permissions granted to individual applications. The output of this command displays the configuration keys along with their current values. It provides a quick way to check and manage Flatpak''s global configurations.'
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak config --ostree-verbose` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. This command displays detailed information about the underlying OSTree repository being used by Flatpak. OSTree is a distributed transactional version control system that Flatpak uses to manage its repositories of applications and runtimes. The `--ostree-verbose` option increases the amount of output provided, giving more details on commits, branches, and other aspects of the repository''s structure and state.'
        set: '[AI] `flatpak config --set` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment platform, to set or modify configuration variables for applications or system-wide settings. The syntax is `flatpak config --set <application> <key> <value>`. This command allows users to customize the behavior of Flatpak applications without modifying the source code. For instance, it can be used to enable or disable certain features, set default values for options, or change other application-specific settings.'
        system: '[AI] `flatpak config --system` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux. This command sets system-wide configuration options for Flatpak, overriding user-specific settings. The modifications made with `--system` flag affect all users on the system. For instance, you can use it to set a default branch for remote repositories or configure a custom repo path. Changes made with this command require root privileges to apply.'
        unset: '[AI] `flatpak config --unset` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. This command is used to remove or unset a specific configuration key in the Flatpak settings. The key and its associated value will be deleted from the configuration file, allowing the default behavior or user preference to take effect. This can be useful for resetting a particular setting back to its default state or removing a custom configuration.'
        user: '[AI] `flatpak config --user` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging and deployment system. This command modifies user-specific configuration settings for applications installed via Flatpak. It allows users to customize various aspects of their installed applications, such as setting permissions or environment variables, without affecting system-wide configurations. The changes made with this command only apply to the current user''s account.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak config --verbose` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment platform. This command displays detailed configuration information for Flatpak. The `--verbose` option increases the amount and level of detail in the output, providing more comprehensive information about Flatpak''s current settings, such as the base path for installed apps, the active remotes (repositories), and other advanced options. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues or for gaining a deeper understanding of how Flatpak is configured.'
