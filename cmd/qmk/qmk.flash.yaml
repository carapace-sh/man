documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `qmk flash` command is used in the context of the Quantum Mechanical Keyboard (QMK) firmware for keyboard customization. It instructs the QMK toolchain to compile the keyboard firmware and then flash, or upload, the new firmware to the connected keyboard using a programmer such as AVRDRIVE or bootloader. This command updates the keyboard with the latest customized configuration and functionality.'
    flag:
        bootloader: '[AI] `qmk flash --bootloader` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware to program a custom keyboard layout using an external bootloader such as DFU or USB bootloader. This command specifically flashes only the bootloader onto the keyboard''s microcontroller, allowing it to enter programming mode for further QMK configuration and compilation. Once the bootloader is updated, users can then connect their keyboard to a computer and use QMK toolbox or other software to load custom firmware onto the keyboard.'
        bootloaders: '[AI] The `qmk flash --bootloaders` command is used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware to write specific bootloader software onto the keyboard''s microcontroller memory. When you compile your custom keyboard layout using QMK, you may choose one or more bootloaders for your project. The `--bootloaders` option specifies which bootloader(s) to flash during the `qmk flash` process. It is important to note that this command should be executed on a computer with appropriate tools like the AVRISP mkII programmer, and the keyboard connected via USB to the computer for proper flashing.'
        clean: '[AI] `qmk flash --clean` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware to erase the contents of the keyboard''s microcontroller before flashing new firmware. This command prepares the keyboard for a fresh firmware upload, ensuring that any previous errors or incorrect configurations are eliminated.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `qmk flash --dry-run` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project to perform a simulation of flashing a keyboard firmware without actually writing the new code to the hardware. This command allows users to verify that the correct keys will be remapped or features activated before actually updating the keyboard''s firmware, helping to avoid potential mistakes and ensuring desired changes are implemented correctly.'
        env: '[AI] `qmk flash --env` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware. This command is used to compile and flash a specific QMK keyboard firmware with an environment variable set. The `--env` option allows you to define custom build flags or overrides for the target keyboard firmware file. For instance, you might use it to enable or disable certain features, modify keymaps or configure LED behavior. Once the firmware is compiled, the `qmk flash` command writes the resulting binary file to the connected keyboard using a compatible USB-to-serial programmer or bootloader.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `qmk flash` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware programming suite. This command is responsible for flashing (updating) the keyboard firmware onto a microcontroller. The `--help` option provides detailed usage information about this specific command. Here's a brief summary of its functionality:

            ```
            qmk flash [options] <hexfile> [keyboard:layout]

            Updates the target keyboard's microcontroller with the provided hex file.

            Options:
              --bootmagic           Use bootloader magician to reprogram the bootloader instead of the main firmware.
              --no-verbose          Suppress progress updates during flashing.
              --clean               Erase the target before programming.
              --serial PORT         Specify a custom serial port for communication.
              --passphrase PASSPHRASE
                                   Use a passphrase to authenticate flashing.
              --force               Force flash even if errors occur during verification.
              --help                Show this help message and exit.
            ```

            In simple terms, `qmk flash --help` will display the available options, their descriptions, and usage examples when using the `qmk flash` command for flashing a QMK firmware onto a microcontroller.
        keyboard: '[AI] `qmk flash --keyboard` is a command used in the QMK firmware programming environment. It is used to flash (upload) a new keyboard firmware to a specific QMK-compatible keyboard. The "--keyboard" option specifies which keyboard''s firmware should be updated. This command assumes that the QMK toolbox and the desired keyboard layout file are already installed on the system, and that the keyboard is connected via USB for flashing.'
        keymap: '[AI] `qmk flash --keymap` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware. This command is used to compile and flash a specific keymap on a QMK-compatible keyboard. The "--keymap" option specifies which keymap file to use for compilation. After the keymap is compiled, the resulting firmware is then flashed (uploaded) onto the keyboard using an AVR ISP programmer or similar hardware tool. This process allows users to customize the behavior of their keyboards with new layouts and features.'
        parallel: '[AI] `qmk flash --parallel` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware. It is used to compile and flash multiple keyboards or keyboard configurations in parallel, which significantly reduces the overall flashing time. The `--parallel` option enables the use of multiple threads or processes for compiling and flashing tasks simultaneously, allowing for efficient mass production or updating of QMK-enabled keyboards.'
