documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gatsby develop` is a Gatsby CLI command used for local development and real-time rebuilding of your Gatsby site. It starts the development server, watches for file changes, and automatically rebuilds and serves updated content. This allows you to see the results of your code modifications in real time without manually triggering a build each time.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] `gatsby develop --ca-file` is a command used in GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator. It starts a local development server using `gatsby develop`, but with an added flag `--ca-file`. This flag allows you to specify a Custom Authenticated CA (Certification Authority) file for HTTPS encryption during development. The provided CA file is used to sign the self-signed SSL certificate issued by Gatsby, enabling secure communication between your browser and the development server.'
        cert-file: '[AI] `gatsby develop --cert-file` is a command used with Gatsby, a popular static site generator for React-based projects. This command starts the local development server using HTTPS instead of the default HTTP. The `--cert-file` option specifies the path to an SSL certificate file and its corresponding private key file (in a single .pem or .crt and .key file pair). By providing these files, you can securely develop your Gatsby site locally with encrypted connections before deploying it. This is particularly useful for testing and development of sites that require HTTPS.'
        graphql-tracing: '[AI] `gatsby develop --graphql-tracing` is a command used in Gatsby JS, a popular static site generator, to enable GraphQL request tracing during local development. This option logs detailed information about each GraphQL query and mutation executed in the console, helping developers debug and understand data fetching patterns in their application more effectively. It provides valuable insights into performance issues, data shape, and potential errors.'
        host: '[AI] `gatsby develop --host` is a command used in GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator. This command starts the local development server and makes it accessible at the specified host (default is `localhost`) using port 8000. It also provides real-time rebuilding and livereloading capabilities, allowing for faster development cycles.'
        https: '[AI] `gatsby develop --https` is a command used in GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator. This command starts the local development server with HTTPS encryption. The `gatsby develop` part sets up the development environment, while `--https` enables secure HTTPS communication between your browser and the development server. It''s particularly useful when testing websites that require SSL certification, ensuring data transmitted is encrypted during the development process.'
        inspect: '[AI] `gatsby develop --inspect` is a command used in GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator. This command starts a local development server using `gatsby develop`, and enables the Chrome DevTools inspector to connect to it via `--inspect`. This allows developers to make real-time changes to their Gatsby project and see the results immediately without having to rebuild the entire site every time. It''s particularly useful for frontend development, as it facilitates quicker iteration and debugging in the browser.'
        inspect-brk: '[AI] `gatsby develop --inspect-brk` is a command used in GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator. It starts a local development server with hot reloading and sets a breakpoint in Chrome DevTools for debugging. The `--inspect-brk` flag instructs Gatsby to open the DevTools automatically when the server starts, pausing at the first line of code to allow for debugging. This is particularly useful during development for making live changes and inspecting elements in real-time.'
        key-file: '[AI] `gatsby develop --key-file` is a command used in GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator built with React. This command starts the local development server and provides hot reloading for your Gatsby project. The `--key-file` flag specifies a private key file for HTTPS encryption during development. By using this flag, your local development environment will serve pages over encrypted connections, which is particularly useful if you''re working on a site that requires SSL/TLS certificates or handling sensitive data.'
        open: '[AI] `gatsby develop --open` is a command used in GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator. This command starts the local development server and opens your project''s default browser window to view the site in real-time as you make changes. The `--open` flag automatically opens the browser after the server has started. This workflow allows for quick iterations while developing Gatsby projects.'
        open-tracing-config-file: |-
            [AI] `gatsby develop --open-tracing-config-file` is a command used in Gatsby, a popular static site generator. This command starts the local development server using Gatsby's `develop` script with an additional flag `--open-tracing-config-file`.

            This flag enables OpenTracing, a distributed tracing system, and specifies the path to its configuration file. OpenTracing helps in monitoring and collecting distributed transaction data in complex microservices architectures. With this command, Gatsby applications can have improved performance analysis during development by enabling real-time observability of requests and their dependencies using OpenTracing.
        port: '[AI] `gatsby develop --port` is a command used in GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator built with React. This command starts the local development server with a custom port number specified by the `--port` flag for easier access and sharing of the developing website during the build process. The server automatically rebuilds and restarts when files change, allowing for real-time preview and hot module replacement in the browser.'
