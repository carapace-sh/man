documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dlv redirect` is a Debugger for Language-Agnostic VMs (DLV) command used to modify the standard input, output, or error streams of a running process being debugged with DLV. The syntax is as follows: `dlv redirect <pid> <stream> <file>`, where `<pid>` is the process ID of the target process, `<stream>` represents the stream to be modified (e.g., "stdin", "stdout", or "stderr"), and `<file>` is the path to the file that will replace the original stream. The command redirects the specified stream to read from or write to the given file instead of its default destination, allowing for input manipulation and output redirection during debugging sessions.'
