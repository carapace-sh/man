description: rebuild the charts/ directory based on the Chart.lock file
flags:
    --keyring=: keyring containing public keys
    --skip-refresh: do not refresh the local repository cache
    --verify: verify the packages against signatures
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `helm dependency build` command is used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager, to build dependencies of a Helm chart before installing or upgrading it. This command fetches and builds any dependencies listed in the chart''s `values.yaml`, `requirements.yaml`, or a `Chart.lock` file, ensuring that they are up-to-date and compatible with the target Kubernetes cluster environment. It helps maintain a consistent state of the entire system by managing the dependencies alongside the main application, thus simplifying the deployment process.'
    flag:
        keyring: '[AI] The `helm dependency build --keyring` command is used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager, to build Docker images for dependencies mentioned in a Helm chart''s values.yml file, while also generating and using a GPG keyring file for signing the resulting images. This command ensures that the built images have authenticity and integrity, which is crucial in a production environment where security is paramount.'
        skip-refresh: |-
            [AI] `helm dependency build --skip-Refresh` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command performs two main tasks:

            1. **Dependency Update:** Helm checks the dependencies defined in a chart and updates them to their latest versions.

            2. **Skip Refresh:** The `--skip-refresh` flag instructs Helm to not pull new images for the dependencies from the repositories, even if there are updated versions available. This can save time during development or testing phases when you want to keep using specific previous versions of dependencies. By skipping the refresh, Helm only builds the updated dependency charts from their sources.
        verify: |-
            [AI] `helm dependency build --verify` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command performs two main actions:

            1. **Dependencies Update:** It updates the dependencies of the current chart (Helm package) to their latest versions defined in `Chart.yaml`.
            2. **Build and Verify:** After updating dependencies, it builds the chart using the updated dependencies and runs a series of checks to ensure the chart functions correctly and conforms to Helm standards. The `--verify` flag ensures that all tests pass before continuing. If any test fails, the command will exit with an error message.
