documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh run view` is a GitHubActions command used to display the logs and output of a specific workflow run on GitHub. It returns the build status, workflow log, and artifact download links in various formats like text, JSON or Markdown. This command helps developers diagnose issues, monitor progress, and access results from their GitHubActions workflows.'
    flag:
        attempt: '[AI] `gh run view --attempt` is a GitHub Actions command used to check the status of the latest workflow run for a specific workflow job. The `--attempt` argument specifies which attempt of the job to inspect, with 0 being the most recent attempt. The output includes details such as the start and end times, status (success/failure), and logs associated with the specified attempt.'
        exit-status: '[AI] The `gh run view --exit-status` command is a GitHub Action CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to retrieve the exit status of a specific workflow run job in GitHub Actions. This command provides the status of the job, whether it was successful (with an exit code 0) or if there were errors or failures (exit code other than 0). It helps in quickly assessing the outcome of a specific job execution and can be useful for monitoring and debugging workflow runs.'
        job: '[AI] `gh run view --job` is a command used in GitHub Actions, specifically to view the details of a specific job execution within a workflow. The GitHub CLI tool (gh) is used to execute this command. The output will display various job-related information such as its status, start and end times, duration, and log transcripts. This can be helpful in debugging or understanding the progress of a particular workflow execution.'
        jq: '[AI] `gh run view` is a GitHubActions command used to view the log output or inspect the environment variables of a specific workflow run. The option `--jq` is used with `jq`, a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. With `--jq`, you can filter, transform, and process JSON data returned by `gh run view`. This allows for more complex queries and analysis of the workflow run output or environment variables. For example, you might use `--jq ''.jobs[-1].output''` to extract the standard output of the last job in a workflow run.'
        json: '[AI] `gh run view --json` is a GitHubActions command used to retrieve the details of a specific GitHub Actions workflow run in JSON format. The `gh` is short for GitHub CLI tool, and this particular command is used with it to interact with GitHub Actions. The `view` subcommand shows the logs or artifacts of a workflow run, while `--json` option makes the output in a machine-readable JSON format.'
        log: '[AI] `gh run view --log` is a GitHubActions command used to view the logs of a specific GitHubActions workflow run. The `gh` is short for GitHub, and this command is executed using the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. The `run view` subcommand displays the details of a particular workflow run, while the `--log` option shows the complete logs output associated with that run.'
        log-failed: '[AI] `gh run view --log-failed` is a command used in GitHubActions (GHA) to view the logs of specific workflow runs that have failed. The `--log-failed` option filters the output to only show the logs of failed runs, helping users quickly identify and troubleshoot issues in their workflows.'
        template: '[AI] `gh run view` is a GitHubActions command used to view the logs and output of a specific GitHub Action workflow run. The `--template` option is used with this command to customize the output format of the log viewer using Mustache templates. This allows users to extract specific information from the logs, making it easier to understand and analyze the results of their GitHub Actions workflows.'
        verbose: '[AI] `gh run view --verbose` is a command used in GitHub Actions, which is a continuous integration and delivery tool provided by GitHub. This command is used to display detailed logs of a specific workflow run. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output displayed, providing more information about the progress and status of each step in the workflow. It helps in debugging and understanding the execution details of your GitHub Actions workflows.'
        web: '[AI] `gh run view --web` is a GitHubActions command used to access and view the web output of a GitHub Run, which is a background job for processing code in GitHub. The `--web` flag makes the output accessible through a URL, allowing users to interact with the output directly without having to download files or access the console log.'
