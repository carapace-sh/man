documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flatpak build-sign` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to digitally sign a built Flatpak bundle. This signing process ensures authenticity and integrity of the software, allowing secure distribution and installation. The command takes a path to the machine-key or a private key file as an argument, which is then used for signing the metadata and the appbundle. The signed artifacts are saved in the output directory specified.'
    flag:
        arch: '[AI] `flatpak build-sign` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. The `--arch` option specifies the architecture for which the signed artifacts are to be generated. In other words, it indicates whether the build artifacts will be for a specific architecture like `x86_64`, `armv7l`, or others, ensuring that the resulting packages can only run on systems with that architecture.'
        gpg-homedir: '[AI] `flatpak build-sign` is a command-line utility in Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. The `--gpg-homedir` option specifies the path to the GnuPG home directory that contains the private keys used for signing the Flatpak builds. This option ensures that the correct keys are used during the build signing process and maintains the security of the signing keys.'
        gpg-sign: '[AI] `flatpak build-sign` is a command from the Flatpak application packaging system. It is used to sign a built Flatpak application bundle, ensuring its authenticity and integrity. The `--gpg-sign` option specifies that this signing should be done using GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) keys instead of other types of certificates. This adds an important layer of security by verifying the identity of the package maintainer and guaranteeing that the package has not been tampered with during distribution.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `flatpak build-sign` is a command-line utility used in the Flatpak application packaging system to sign built Flatpak applications for secure distribution. The `--help` option is used to display detailed help information about using this command. Here's what you can expect:

            When you run `flatpak build-sign --help`, it will output a usage message that explains the basic syntax and purpose of the command, followed by a more detailed explanation of each argument or option that can be used with it. Some common options include:

            * `--key-file <FILE>`: The path to the private key file used for signing.
            * `--component <COMPONENT>`: The name or path of the Flatpak component (application) to sign.
            * `--output <OUTPUT>`: The path where the signed application bundle will be saved.

            The help output also provides examples and additional information about using these options, as well as any other advanced features that might be available with the command.
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak build-sign` is a command-line tool provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The command `--ostree-verbose` is an optional argument that can be passed to the `build-sign` command to increase the level of output during the signing process using OSTree as the backend for the build service. This argument results in detailed information being displayed about each step taken during the signing and verification process, which can be helpful for debugging and understanding what is happening behind the scenes.'
        runtime: '[AI] The `flatpak build-sign --runtime` command is used to sign a Flatpak application bundle and specify the runtime that the application should use at runtime. The "--runtime" option indicates which specific Flatpak runtime to use for running the signed application, ensuring compatibility and consistency across different environments.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak build-sign` is a command-line tool provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The `--verbose` option increases the output of the command to provide more detailed information during the signing process. This can help developers debug issues or better understand what''s happening when building and signing their applications for distribution as Flatpak apps.'
