documentation:
    command: '[AI] "dive compression" is not a valid PowerShell command. If you meant "Dive PowerShell," it''s a module for PowerShell that provides tab completion and other features similar to Bash''s "Tab Complete." You need to install Dive first using PowerShell Gallery or Chocolatey, then import the module in your script or session with `Import-Module Dive`. After setup, you can use the tab key for suggesting completions while typing commands, file paths, variable names, etc. in PowerShell console or scripts.'
    flag:
        no-descriptions: '[AI] The `dive` command in PowerShell is a part of the PSReadLine module, which provides enhanced line editing capabilities. The `--no-descriptions` flag that follows `dive` completes a PowerShell command or function call without displaying any description or help text for the completed item. In other words, it performs a silent completion of the command or function call in the PowerShell console.'
