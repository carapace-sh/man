documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux select-pane` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to switch focus between panes within a single TMUX session. It does not create or modify any panes, but simply changes which pane is active and receives input. This can be useful for navigating multiple processes or projects running in different panes within a single terminal window. The command can be followed by the directional keys `-u` (up), `-d` (down), `-l` (left), or `-r` (right) to select the pane above, below, to the left, or to the right, respectively. Without any direction specified, it will simply toggle focus between the current and the adjacent pane.'
    flag:
        D: '[AI] `tmux select-pane -D` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. It deselects the currently selected pane and detaches it, meaning the session containing that pane will continue running in the background while not attached to any terminal. This can be useful for background processes or long-running jobs, freeing up space in the terminal window for other tasks.'
        L: '[AI] The `tmux select-pane` command is used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to select a pane among multiple panes in a Tmux window. The `-L` option stands for "last", which means this command will select the last (previously selected) pane. So, `tmux select-pane -L` is used to go back to the previously selected pane.'
        M: '[AI] The `tmux` command `select-pane -M` is used to select a pane in a Tmux terminal multiplexer session with the alternative screen mode active (-M option). When this command is executed, Tmux will highlight and bring focus to the selected pane without affecting the contents of other panes. This allows users to navigate through their sessions and manipulate individual panes as needed.'
        R: '[AI] The `tmux` command `select-pane -R` is used to select the pane to the right of the currently selected pane. The `-R` option indicates that selection should move in a rightward direction. This command is often used in `tmux` session management to switch focus between different panes within a single window or multiple windows.'
        T: '[AI] `tmux select-pane` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer that allows you to select a pane among multiple panes in a TMUX window. The `-T` option is used to provide a label or title for the selected pane. So, `tmux select-pane -T "name_of_the_pane"` will select the pane with that label and bring it to the front.'
        U: '[AI] The `tmux` command `select-pane -U` is used to select the pane above the currently selected pane in a TMUX terminal multiplexer session. The `-U` option specifies that we want to move up one pane, regardless of the direction of the current pane''s layout. This command allows users to navigate and switch between panes within their TMUX sessions.'
        Z: '[AI] The command `tmux select-pane -Z` is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to vertically split the current pane into two and zoom the newly created pane to fit the height of the closest window or terminal to it. This can be useful for comparing or viewing two panes side by side, with each pane displaying the maximum content possible based on their respective terminal sizes.'
        d: '[AI] The `tmux` command `select-pane -d` is used to detach and delete a pane in the `tmux` terminal multiplexer. When you run this command, it will first switch to the pane that you want to delete (using `select-pane`), and then detach that pane from the session using the `-d` flag, effectively deleting it from the layout. This can be useful when you no longer need a particular pane in your terminal multiplexer setup.'
        e: '[AI] `tmux select-pane -e` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer that allows you to send input to an specific pane within a tmux session. The "-e" flag stands for "send-keys-as-chars", meaning that the characters you type will be interpreted and sent as if you were typing directly into that pane, rather than being treated as tmux commands. By default, when you send input to tmux, it interprets some keys (like Ctrl+B) as tmux shortcuts, which can be confusing or unintended in certain situations. With `select-pane -e`, the input is sent directly to the selected pane, bypassing tmux''s command interpretation.'
        l: '[AI] `tmux select-pane -l` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. It horizontally splits the current pane into two panes, selecting the new lower pane. This can be useful for viewing multiple processes or sessions side by side within the same terminal window.'
        m: '[AI] The `tmux` command `select-pane -m` is used to mark a pane in a `tmux` session. The `-m` option modifies the marked pane, making it the main pane where input is sent by default. This allows you to interact with applications running in that pane while other panes continue running in the background. When you want to switch focus back to another pane, use the `select-pane` command again without the `-m` option.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux select-pane -t` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. It allows you to select a pane (split window) based on its target, which can be specified by its index, name or even by its content. The option `-t` indicates that a target should be provided, making it useful for selecting panes based on their properties instead of the default order in the layout.'
