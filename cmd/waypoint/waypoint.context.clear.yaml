documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint context clear` command in Waypoint (a Hashicorp tool for managing application lifecycles) is used to delete all current contexts, effectively resetting the environment back to its default state. Contexts are sets of configurations and environments that define where applications run, such as Kubernetes clusters or Docker hosts. By clearing all contexts, Waypoint removes any customizations and reverts back to using only the defaults, allowing users to start fresh when working with their applications.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `waypoint context clear --app` command is used in the Docker Compose tool (specifically, with Docker Swarm mode) to remove and reset the application context associated with a service. This means that any previous state or configurations are discarded, and the service will be recreated from its defined configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file. It''s typically used when you want to ensure a clean start for an application, discarding any previously applied environment variables, volumes, or networks.'
        plain: '[AI] The command `waypoint context clear --plain` is used in Kubernetes to clear the active context in the `kubectl` configuration without saving the previous context to a file. The `--plain` flag indicates that the output should be in plain text format. This can be useful when accidentally selecting the wrong context or for troubleshooting purposes.'
        project: '[AI] The command `waypoint context clear --project` in Kubernetes is used to remove the currently set project context within Waypoint, a multi-cluster application management tool. This action does not delete any projects or resources in the cluster but simply clears the current context, allowing you to set a new one if needed.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint context clear --workspace` command is used in Docker Docker Desktop and Docker Compose to remove the currently active environment or workspace in Waypoint. This means that any previously configured environments, contexts, and associated configurations will be removed, allowing you to start fresh with a clean slate when working on a new project or configuration.'
