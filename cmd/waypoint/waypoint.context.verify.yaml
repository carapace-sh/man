        app: '[AI] The `waypoint context verify --app` command in Kubernetes is used to check the current context and ensure that it is set to the correct application context within Waypoint, an open-source application delivery platform built on top of Terraform and Kubernetes. This command helps prevent misconfigurations or errors when deploying applications by confirming the intended context before taking further actions.'
        plain: '[AI] The `waypoint context verify --plain` command is used in Kubernetes to validate the current configuration of a Waypoint, which is a GitOps operator for deploying and managing applications across multiple clusters. The `--plain` flag indicates that the output should be in plain text format without any colorization or formatting. This command checks the current state of the Waypoint against the desired state specified in the Git repository, and reports any differences or errors.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint context verify --project` command is used in Google Cloud''s Waypoint tool for managing multicloud Kubernetes deployments. This specific command checks the current context against a specified project in your Waypoint configuration file to ensure they match. If there is a mismatch, an error will be returned to help prevent misconfiguration and potential deployment errors.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint context verify --workspace` command is used in the Waypoint software development tool to check the current working directory against a defined workspace file. A workspace file in Waypoint describes the composition of an application, including its components and their respective configurations. Running this command ensures that the local environment matches the specified configuration in the workspace file, facilitating consistent and reproducible builds and deployments.'
