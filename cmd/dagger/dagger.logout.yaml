    command: '[AI] The `daggar logout` command is used in Docker DAGger (Daggen), a tool for managing and executing Docker container workflows described in Docker Compose files, to terminate an ongoing SSH connection to a remote machine established for running the workflow. Once executed, this command disconnects the current session and logs out from the remote host, freeing up resources on both sides.'
