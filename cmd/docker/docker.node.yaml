        [AI] The `docker node` command is not a valid Docker command as of now. Docker Swarm is a native clustering and scheduling tool for Docker applications, but it doesn't have a specific `node` command with the meaning you might be thinking of. If you meant to ask about joining or managing nodes in a Docker Swarm cluster using the `docker swarm` command instead, here's a brief explanation:

        The `docker swarm join` command is used to add a node to an existing Docker Swarm cluster. The syntax is as follows:
        ```bash
        docker swarm join <swarm-manager-ip>:<swarm-manager-port> --token <swarm-token>
        ```
        Replace `<swarm-manager-ip>`, `<swarm-manager-port>`, and `<swarm-token>` with the actual IP address, port number, and token value of the Swarm manager node. This command will make the joining node a worker node in the cluster, which can then run and distribute Docker services.

        For managing nodes within a Swarm cluster using the CLI, you would typically use commands like `docker node ls` to list all nodes, or `docker node inspect <node-id>` to inspect detailed information about a specific node.
