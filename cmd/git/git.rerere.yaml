    --rerere-autoupdate: register clean resolutions in index
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git rerere` is a Git feature that stands for "resume reading earlier resume file." It''s a tool designed to help with conflict resolution during merge operations. When you perform a merge in Git and there are conflicting changes, Git will save the conflicting files as "merge bases" in the `.git/rerere/` directory. The next time you attempt to merge the same files, Git can analyze these merge bases and automatically apply the previously resolved conflicts, saving you the effort of manually resolving them again. This command is typically used when you frequently merge the same branches or files with similar changes.'
    flag:
        rerere-autoupdate: '[AI] `git rerere --rerere-autoupdate` is a Git command that enables and automates the use of Git''s Rerere (Resolved-conflicts Reusable Estimates) feature. This feature records previous conflict resolutions and suggests them as solutions when similar conflicts arise in future commits. With `--rerere-autoupdate`, Git will automatically update the rerere index whenever a new commit with a conflicting file is pushed, making it easier to apply previous conflict solutions. The goal of this command is to save time and effort by reusing resolved conflict solutions instead of manually resolving them each time.'
