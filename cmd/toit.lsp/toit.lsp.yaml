documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "toit.toit.lsp" appears to be specific to the TOIT programming language and its associated Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This command likely refers to the TOIT Language Server Process (LSP), which is responsible for providing IntelliSense features, code completion, and other advanced editing capabilities when using an IDE or text editor with language-specific support. By invoking this command, users may initiate or restart the LSP in order to enhance their development experience within the TOIT programming language.'
    flag:
        cpuprofile: '[AI] The `toit toit.lsp --cpuprofile` command is used in Toit programming language for generating a CPU profile of a Toit application named `toit.lsp`. The flag `--cpuprofile` instructs the Toit toolchain to produce a detailed report about the execution time and call stack information of functions in the application during its runtime. This information is saved as a CPU profile file, which can be further analyzed to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the code.'
        help: '[AI] `toit toit.lsp --help` is a command used in the Toit programming language. The `--help` argument requests displaying the help information for the given command, which in this case is `toit.lsp`. This command is likely the Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for Toit. The help information will provide details on how to use the LSP effectively with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), editor, or text editor. It may include options related to logging, performance settings, and other customization features.'
        memprofile: |-
            [AI] `toit toit.lsp --memprofile` is a command used in the Toit programming language. The `toit` part refers to the Toit compiler or interpreter, and `toit.lsp` is likely the name of the project or script being run.

            The `--memprofile` flag enables memory profiling during program execution. When run, Toit generates detailed information about the dynamic memory usage of the program, allowing developers to identify memory leaks and optimize memory allocation.
        sdk: |-
            [AI] The command `toit toit.lsp --sdk` is related to Toit, an open-source programming language and software development kit (SDK) for building cross-platform applications. The flags in this command have the following meanings:

            1. `toit`: This is a call to the Toit compiler or interpreter.
            2. `toit.lsp`: This specifies the name of the source file to be compiled or interpreted.
            3. `--sdk`: This flag enables the use of the Toit SDK during compilation or interpretation. The SDK provides additional libraries and tools for developing applications, making it easier to build complex software using the Toit language.
        toitc: '[AI] `toit toit.lsp --toitc` is a command in the Toit programming language. The `toit` executable is used to build and run Toit programs. In this case, it is being used to compile the source file `toit.lsp` into an executable or library using the `--toitc` flag. This generates Toit code that can be run or linked with other Toit programs.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] The command `toit toit.lsp --verbose` is written in the Toit programming language. Toit is a statically-typed, object-oriented language designed for developing portable and efficient systems and applications.

            The given command is used to compile a Toit source file named "toit.lsp" with the Toit compiler named "toit". The `--verbose` flag enables detailed output during the compilation process, providing more information about the build progress and any potential errors or warnings that might occur.
