documentation:
    command: '[AI] `awk` is a powerful text processing tool in Unix and Linux operating systems. It reads input data one record at a time, applying actions defined by the user to each record using a simple yet flexible programming language. These actions can include printing specific fields or records, performing calculations, manipulating strings, and more. The basic syntax is `awk ''{action}'' input_file`, where `action` specifies what to do with each record.'
    flag:
        assign: |-
            [AI] `awk` is a powerful text-processing tool with a programming language built-in. The `--assign` option in `awk` is used to set or update values of variables before execution begins. This can be useful for initializing variables with constant values or setting up common values for multiple patterns or expressions within the script. The general syntax is:

            ```bash
            awk 'pattern { actions }' --assign var=value scriptfile
            ```

            Here, `var` is the name of the variable to be assigned a value (can include nested arrays), and `value` is the constant value to be assigned. This allows for more concise and efficient scripts by setting up initial values before processing data in the script file provided.
        bignum: '[AI] The `awk` command is a powerful text processing tool in Unix and Linux systems. The `--bignum` option is not a flag but rather an argument that tells `awk` to use double-precision floating point numbers instead of single-precision for internal arithmetic calculations, allowing for larger numeric values to be processed accurately. This can be particularly useful when working with large numerical data.'
        characters-as-bytes: '[AI] The `--characters-as-bytes` option in Awk is used to treat input characters as raw bytes instead of their corresponding character values. This means that Awk will process each byte independently, without interpreting it as a character. It''s often used when dealing with binary data or files whose contents should not be interpreted as text.'
        copyright: '[AI] The `awk` command is a powerful text processing tool in Unix-like operating systems. Its flag `--copyright` is used to display the copyright and license information of the `awk` program being used. This flag is typically not directly invoked by users in scripts or commands, but is instead built into various distributions of `awk`. When `awk` is run with this flag, it will print out the copyright and licensing terms for the specific version of `awk` being executed, which can help users understand the legal terms governing its use.'
        debug: |-
            [AI] `awk` is a powerful text-processing tool used for extracting and manipulating data from various sources, such as files or input streams. The `--debug` option is a diagnostic feature available in some versions of `awk`.

            When you run an `awk` script with the `--debug` flag (e.g., `awk --debug 'script' file.txt`), it enables verbose mode, providing more detailed information about how the interpreter processes your script:

            1. It prints a line for each statement in your script as it is executed.
            2. It shows the current input record and its corresponding record number.
            3. It displays the values of any variables or expressions at each step.
            4. It reveals the flow of control, showing which part of your code is being executed at any given moment.

            In summary, using `awk --debug` helps you understand how your script operates internally and can be valuable for debugging complex scripts.
        dump-variables: |-
            [AI] The `awk` command is a powerful text processing tool used for extracting and manipulating data in various ways. The `--dump-variables` option is not a common command but rather an internal diagnostic feature of `awk`.

            When you run `awk` with this option, it prints out all the defined variables and their values within the script or programmatically set during the execution. This can be useful for debugging complex scripts to understand the current state of variables at a particular point in time. It provides essential insights into the variable usage and their values that might not be easily visible through other means, thus helping in identifying issues and inconsistencies within the script.
        exec: |-
            [AI] The `awk` command in Unix or Unix-like operating systems is a powerful text processing tool for extracting and manipulating data from various sources. The option `--exec` is used to specify a program or script to be executed by `awk` instead of the default built-in actions. This allows you to write custom logic within an `awk` script, providing more flexibility and control over the data processing pipeline. For example:

            ```bash
            awk --exec 'program { file }' input_file
            ```

            In this syntax, `program` is a script written in the `awk` programming language that will be executed for each record (line by default) in the `input_file`. The `{ file }` part is an optional argument that represents the current input file name. By using the `--exec` option, you can create more complex and customized data processing workflows with `awk`, making it a versatile tool for handling structured and semi-structured text data.
        field-separator: |-
            [AI] The `awk` command is a powerful text processing tool in Unix and Linux. The option `--field-separator` (`-F`) is used to specify custom delimiters or fields separators other than the default whitespaces for `awk`'s built-in field functions such as `$1`, `$2`, etc. This can be useful when processing files with non-standard record and field structures. For instance, if you have a file where comma-separated values are enclosed in double quotes, you can set the field separator to be a comma within double quotes using the option:

            ```bash
            awk --field-separator='[,"]+' 'command' input_file
            ```

            This tells `awk` to treat commas and any occurrences of double quotes as field separators while processing the file.
        file: '[AI] The `awk` command is a powerful text processing tool in Unix-like operating systems. The option `--file` or `-f` is used to specify the name of an `awk` script file instead of embedding the script in the command line. For instance, `awk --file=script_file input_file` will run the script `script_file` against the input file `input_file`.'
        gen-pot: |-
            [AI] `awk` is a powerful text processing tool in Unix or Linux environments. The option `--gen-pot` is not actually an flag for `awk`, but rather for `gettext`, which is often used together with `awk` to extract translatable strings from code or data files for internationalization (i18n) purposes.

            When you use `awk` to process your source files, and there are translatable messages hardcoded in the scripts or data, you can generate a `.pot` file using `gettext`. The `--gen-pot` option is passed when invoking `xgettext`, which is a utility of gettext package, to scan your `awk` script files and extract all translatable strings, so that you can create translation files in different languages based on the generated `.pot` file.
        help: '[AI] `awk` is a powerful text-processing program in Unix/Linux operating systems. The option `--help` is used to display a brief help message that explains the basic usage and syntax of the `awk` command, including valid arguments and options for common tasks. This helps users understand how to write and run simple or complex text processing commands using `awk`.'
        include: |-
            [AI] The `--include` option in Awk is used to specify one or more files that should be treated as if they were part of the main input file, when processing a script with the Awk interpreter `awk`. This allows for modularizing Awk scripts by separating commonly used functions and expressions into included files. The syntax is:

            ```sh
            awk 'script' [options] [file1 [file2 ...]] --include=file1.awk [file2.awk ...]
            ```

            In the above command, `file1.awk`, `file2.awk`, etc., are additional files that will be included in the script's processing along with the main input file(s).
        lint: '[AI] `awk` is a powerful text processing tool in Unix-based systems. The option `--lint` is not a built-in flag for `awk`, but rather an external linting tool specifically designed for checking `awk` scripts, such as `gawk`''s built-in diagnostic mode or AwlStyle. This flag enables various checks for syntax errors, potential bugs, and stylistic issues, ensuring that the `awk` script adheres to best practices and is free from common mistakes. By using this flag during script development, users can detect and resolve problems early on in the process, ultimately leading to more robust and efficient scripts.'
        lint-old: '[AI] `awk` is a powerful text processing tool in Unix/Linux operating systems. The option `--lint-old` is not a standard flag for `awk`, but rather for Algorithmic Language (Gawk)''s built-in linter, which checks the syntax and style of your `awk` scripts for potential errors or warnings. It''s an older version of the Gawk linter that was available in older versions of Gawk before the release of `--lint`. Using `awk --lint-old` is equivalent to running the script through the old linter, which might be preferred if you are working with legacy code or want to maintain consistency with earlier projects.'
        load: '[AI] The `awk` command is a powerful text-processing tool in Unix-like operating systems. The option `--load` or `-f` is used with it to specify a file that contains Awk programming scripts instead of embedding the script directly into the command line. This flag allows users to write complex and reusable Awk programs and apply them to various files as needed.'
        no-optimize: '[AI] The `--no-optimize` flag in Awk is used to disable compiler optimizations during program execution. When this option is set, Awk will process the code without applying any internal optimizations that could potentially improve the performance or efficiency of the script. This can be useful for debugging or when dealing with complex scripts where unexpected behavior may arise due to optimizations.'
        non-decimal-data: '[AI] The `awk` command is a powerful text processing tool in Unix and Linux operating systems. The option `--non-decimal-data` is a flag used with `awk` to handle input data that is not in the decimal number format (i.e., text or binary data). When this flag is specified, `awk` assumes that the input data is not numeric and will treat it as strings by default. This can be particularly useful when processing files containing non-numerical data like CSV or binary files, ensuring correct string handling without the need for explicit conversions.'
        optimize: '[AI] The `--optimize` flag in Awk is an option that enables various optimizations in the awk compiler. These optimizations can lead to improved performance and efficiency of awk programs by reducing the number of intermediate data structures, compiling code more aggressively, and utilizing machine-specific instructions where possible. Using this flag may result in smaller and faster executables, but it could also potentially introduce compatibility issues with certain older or less capable systems.'
        posix: |-
            [AI] `awk` is a powerful text-processing tool in Unix-like operating systems. The option `--posix` is used to enable Posix compatibility mode when running `awk`. This means that the behavior of `awk` is limited to conform to the IEEE Std 1003.1 (POSIX) specification, which ensures portability and consistency across different implementations of `awk`.

            With `--posix`, some advanced features like multidimensional arrays, regular expressions with lookahead/lookbehind assertions or variable length lookbehind, and non-standard built-in functions may not be available. However, it guarantees the presence of a wide range of essential functionality that is common across all POSIX compliant `awk` implementations.
        pretty-print: '[AI] `awk` is a powerful text processing tool in Unix and other operating systems. The `--pretty-print` option is used with `awk` to print output in a more readable and formatted way by default, without the need to explicitly specify output format in the script using constructs like `printf()`. It makes the output more aligned and easier to read by automatically indenting and adding spaces between fields or records. This option simplifies complex scripts for reporting or formatting data.'
        profile: '[AI] The `awk` command with the `--profile` option is used to load and execute a separate AWS KeyPair file or profile configuration before running an `awk` script. This is particularly useful when dealing with scripts that require access to AWS services, such as Amazon S3 or Amazon DynamoDB, where different profiles may be needed for security reasons. The profile file (in JSON format) specifies the AccessKeyID and SecretAccessKey for authentication. By using `--profile`, you can easily switch between different AWS profiles without modifying your script.'
        re-interval: |-
            [AI] `awk` is a powerful text processing tool in Unix and other Unix-like operating systems. The `--re-interval` option is a flag used with `awk` to enable the use of regular expressions in the range specification for subscripts, allowing for more complex indexing and manipulation of arrays.

            In simple terms, it extends the functionality of regular expression patterns to work within array indices, providing more flexibility and expressiveness when processing data with `awk`.
        sandbox: '[AI] The `--sandbox` option in GNU Awk (gawk) is used to enable the built-in SECURITY feature called Sandboxed_Shell. This feature restricts the execution of shell commands within awk, improving security by preventing potential command injection attacks and other malicious activities. By default, gawk does not use this sandbox mode, but enabling it with the `--sandbox` flag increases the safety of running awk scripts in potentially untrusted environments.'
        source: |-
            [AI] The `awk` command with the `--source` option is used to load and execute an `awk` script from a file without creating a new process. Instead of running the script in a separate instance of awk, the script is read by the current awk process. This can be useful for automating the execution of multiple awk scripts within a single workflow or pipeline. The syntax is as follows:

            ```bash
            awk --source <file_containing_script> <input_files>
            ```

            Replace `<file_containing_script>` with the path to the file that contains your awk script, and `<input_files>` with the paths or input to be processed by the awk scripts. The `awk` command will read the script from the specified file, compile it, and then execute it against the provided input files.
        traditional: '[AI] The `awk` command with the `--traditional` flag is used to invoke the classic behavior of `awk`, which was the default in older versions. With this flag, field separators are set to whitespace by default, instead of the more flexible and potentially complex regular expressions used in modern `awk`. This option may be preferred for simple text processing tasks where dealing with complex fields separation is not necessary.'
        use-lc-numeric: '[AI] The `--use-lc-numeric` option is a flag for the `awk` programming language. It instructs `awk` to interpret numeric literals in a script or input data as lowercase numbers, following the "locale''s numerical value" rule. This can be important when dealing with locales that use different numbering systems, such as those based on base 20 or base 16 digits, where lowercase letters may have numeric values. By default, `awk` interprets numeric literals in a script as decimal numbers, regardless of the locale.'
        version: '[AI] `awk --version` is a command used in Unix-based systems to check the installed version of the Awk processing language. When executed in a terminal, it prints out the version number and compilation information of the Awk utility installed in the system. For example, "GNU Awk 4.2.1" or "awk version 3.1.8". This helps users to identify which version of Awk they are using for scripting purposes.'
