description: Safely check for updates
flags:
    --builddir=: build directory (use with --devel)
    --devel: also check development packages updates (use with --aur)
    --no-aur: do not check updates in AUR
    --no-devel: do not check development packages updates
    -a, --aur: also check updates in AUR
    -q, --quiet: only print one line per update
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pamac checkupdates` command is a utility provided by Pamac (Paradigm Package Manager for Arch Linux), which is used to verify and display the availability of package updates in the system''s repositories. When executed, this command retrieves metadata from the configured repositories and generates a list of packages with available updates and their corresponding update sizes. It does not install any updates but instead prepares the information required for an informed decision before running `pamac upgrade` or similar commands to apply the identified updates.'
    flag:
        aur: '[AI] The command `pacman --checkupdates --aur` in Arch Linux is used to check for available updates for both the official and AUR (Arch User Repository) packages. The `--aur` flag specifically searches for updates in the AUR, which are user-submitted packages that aren''t part of the official repositories but have been approved by the Arch community. The output will list the available package updates with their new versions and the size difference between the current and new packages.'
        builddir: '[AI] The `pamac checkupdates --builddir` command is a function of Pamac, the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux. This command initiates a process to check for available updates in the repositories and generates build files (.pbz files) that can be used to create local packages for any outdated or obsolete software packages. The `--builddir` option specifies the directory where Pamac should place these build files, which can be useful for offline installation of updates. In summary, `pamac checkupdates --builddir` prepares local packages for updates and stores them in the specified directory.'
        devel: '[AI] `pamac checkupdates --devel` is a command used in Arch Linux to update the development versions of installed packages managed by the Pacman Package Manager using the Pamac helper application. The `--devel` option specifies that updates for both stable and development (AUR) packages should be checked for availability. This command does not install or apply any updates; it only shows a list of available updates, allowing the user to manually decide which ones to install.'
        no-aur: |-
            [AI] The `pamac checkupdates --no-aur` command is used in Arch Linux for updating the local package database without installing or upgrading any new packages from the Arch User Repository (AUR).

            Here's a brief explanation of the components:

            1. `pamac`: It is a simple and fast package manager for Arch Linux, which can be used as an alternative to the more commonly known `pacman`.
            2. `checkupdates`: This is an action that can be performed using `pamac`. It scans your system for packages that have available updates in the repositories.
            3. `--no-aur`: This option explicitly tells `pamac` to exclude packages from the AUR when checking for updates.
            4. The overall command `pamac checkupdates --no-aur` instructs `pamac` to scan the system for updates available in the official repositories without touching the AUR packages.
        no-devel: |-
            [AI] `pamac checkupdates --no-devel` is a command used in Arch Linux and other Arch-based distributions to update the system's Pacman package database without installing or upgrading development packages.

            Pacman is the package manager for Arch Linux, which allows users to easily manage and install software on their systems. The `checkupdates` command is used to check the Arch Linux repositories for available package updates.

            The `--no-devel` option is passed to exclude development (or -libs) packages from being updated. Development packages contain additional libraries, headers, and documentation that are often not necessary for most users. Updating these packages can take up a significant amount of time and bandwidth.

            Therefore, using `pamac checkupdates --no-devel` is an efficient way to quickly update the essential packages on your system without wasting resources on unnecessary development packages.
        quiet: '[AI] `pamac checkupdates --quiet` is a command used in Arch Linux for updating the package database without displaying any messages or notifications during the process. The `pamac` package manager from the Arch User Repository (AUR) is used here instead of the default `pacman`. The `--quiet` option suppresses all output, making it suitable for automated tasks or background processes.'
