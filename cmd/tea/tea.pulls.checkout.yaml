        [AI] The `tea pulls checkout` command is not a standard Git or version control command. It seems to be specific to the "tea" version control system, which is not widely used and has limited documentation.

        Based on the name, it might be an alias or shorthand for performing both "fetch" and "checkout" operations in one step. The fetch command retrieves new changes from a remote repository without merging them into your local branch. Checkout command allows switching to a different branch or restoring files to their state in a previous commit. Therefore, `tea pulls checkout` could be used to fetch and merge the latest changes from a remote repository into your current working directory.

        However, this is just an educated guess based on the name of the command. For accurate information, it's best to consult the official tea version control documentation or contact its developers.
    flag:
        branch: '[AI] `git tea pull checkout --branch` is a Git command used to perform a "rebase-merging" workflow in the TeaVM Git extension. It fetches and merges the latest changes from a specified branch into your current branch, creating a new commit for each merge. This command also updates your local repository with any new changes and resolves any potential merge conflicts that may arise during the process. In summary, it helps manage multiple branches efficiently by keeping them up-to-date with each other.'
        login: |-
            [AI] `tea pull checkout --login` is a command used in the Terminal or Command Prompt for managing Git repositories using the Teaspoon (tea) CLI tool.

            This command does two things:

            1. It pulls the latest changes from the remote repository to your local repository, merging any conflicts if necessary.
            2. It checks out a specific branch or commit by updating the current working directory to that branch or commit.
            3. The `--login` flag is used to log in to the Git hosting service (like GitHub) if you are using SSH keys or a username and password, so that tea can access your repositories.
        output: '[AI] The `tea pull checksout --output` command is used with the TeaVM tool, a CLI for managing and deploying applications using the GraalVM native image. This command pulls the latest changes from a specified Git repository, checks out the desired branch or commit, and saves the output (the name of the directory containing the checked-out code) to a file. It is particularly useful when working with containerized applications as it automates the process of retrieving updated code and preparing an environment for building native images.'
        remote: |-
            [AI] The `git` command `teen pull checkout --remote` is a composite command consisting of three parts:

            1. `git fetch --all --prunes` or simply `git fetch origin`: This part fetches all the latest commits from the remote repository (origin in this case) without merging them into the local repository, and also removes any stale remote-tracking branches.

            2. `git reset --hard <commit>`: This part resets the HEAD of the current branch to a specific commit. The flag `--hard` implies that both the working directory and the index are reset to match the specified commit.

            3. `git checkout <branch>`: This part changes the current branch to another local branch. It can also be combined with `git pull origin <branch>` to perform a fetch, merge, and switch in one command: `git checkout -- <branch>`. However, when using `--remote`, you are explicitly fetching from the remote repository before checking out the branch.

            The `tea pulls checkout --remote <branch>` command is not a standard Git command and seems to be an alias for the above commands in a specific workflow. It can be used when you want to force-update your local branch with changes from the remote branch, discarding any uncommitted changes in your working directory.
        repo: '[AI] The command `tea pulls checksout --repo <repository>` is used with TeaVM, a GitOps tool for managing Terraform infrastructure as code. This command performs two actions in one step: it first pulls the latest changes from the specified Git repository (`--repo <repository>`) and then checks out the branch or commit containing those changes to apply the updates using Terraform.'
