documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `gum file` command is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It seems to be specific to Gum, a graphical package manager for Windows. This command is likely used to interact with files within the context of Gum, possibly to install, list, or manage files associated with packages or software. For Linux and Unix systems, use file-related commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, or `chmod` instead.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] The command `gum flag --all` in the context of using the GUM (GitHub Ultrafast Merge) CLI tool, sets all flags to their default or most recent value. This command is used when you want to apply all available flags without having to remember or specify each one individually. It helps simplify the command-line experience for users who wish to use all the features provided by GUM in their GitHub workflows.'
        cursor: '[AI] The `gum` command is a popular Git alias tool for PowerShell and Windows Command Line. The specific command `gum file --cursor` is used to retrieve the current branch or commit cursor (also known as the HEAD) of a specified Git repository file or directory. This means it shows you which branch or commit you currently have checked out in Git for that particular file or directory.'
        cursor.align: '[AI] The `--cursor.align` flag in the `git` command line tool is used to align the text cursor with the column grid when using a pager like `less` or `more` during the output of Git commands such as `log`, `status`, or `diff`. When this option is enabled, the text will be wrapped and aligned at column boundaries, making it easier to read long lines. It can improve the visual presentation of Git outputs and enhance the user experience.'
        cursor.background: |-
            [AI] The `gum` command is a popular interactive CLI tool for Git used in Node.js projects. The specific command `gum file --cursor.background` is related to its visual representation of the Git staging area and working directory files.

            This command sets the background color of the cursor that indicates which branch or commit the files belong to, in the Git status output. It's a useful option for improving the readability and understanding of your Git workflow within the terminal.
        cursor.bold: '[AI] The command `gum print --flag "--cursor.bold"` is used in the Gum package for Node.js to set the cursor as bold when printing output in a terminal. This can be useful for making specific text stand out, such as error messages or important information, within the terminal interface.'
        cursor.border: |-
            [AI] `gum` is a popular Node.js library used for creating interactive command-line interfaces. The `--cursor.border` option under the `file` command is used to enable or customize the border around the text cursor while using `gum` for user input.

            This flag accepts a string value representing the desired border style in ANSI escape sequences. Commonly used values include:

            - `"inline"`: A single line under the cursor (default)
            - `"block"`: A box around the text below the cursor
            - `"beam"`: A narrow vertical line under the cursor

            Using this option helps improve visual feedback and user experience in CLI applications built with `gum`. For example, to set the border style to a block, you would use:

            ```javascript
            const { text, file } = require('gum');

            file({
              name: 'My File',
              description: 'Enter your text here.',
              flags: {
                '--cursor.border': 'block'
              },
              onSubmit: (textInput) => console.log(textInput),
            }).then((answer) => console.log('Answer: ', answer));
            ```
        cursor.border-background: '[AI] The `--cursor.border-background` option in the `gum` CLI tool, when used with the `file` command, sets the background color of the cursor border that appears during the interaction with the command-line interface. This allows users to customize the look and feel of their terminal experience.'
        cursor.border-foreground: '[AI] The command `gum flags list --cursor.border-foreground` is used in the Gum CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for Zsh and Bash shells to modify or retrieve the color of the cursor border''s foreground in interactive terminal sessions. The `--cursor.border-foreground` flag sets or gets the foreground color of the cursor''s border in the terminal. By default, it may be set to a system-defined color, such as white for light terminals and black for dark terminals. You can change its value using an ANSI escape code, RGB values, or hexadecimal codes. For instance, `gum flags list --cursor.border-foreground=#FF0000` sets the cursor''s border foreground color to red (#FF0000).'
        cursor.faint: '[AI] The `--cursor.faint` flag is an option used with the Git command-line tool, specifically with the `git diff` and `git log` commands. It modifies the appearance of the cursor that indicates the current branch or commit in the output of these commands. By using this flag, you can make the cursor text less bright or faint, making it blend more with the background and reducing visual clutter. This can be useful for preferences or when working in a terminal or console environment where a clear distinction between different parts of the output is important.'
        cursor.foreground: '[AI] The command `gum flag file --cursor.foreground` is used in the Git Upgrade Manger (Gum) tool to configure the foreground color of the cursor when using Gum in a terminal environment. This can be helpful for improving the visibility and readability of interactive prompts provided by Gum. The `--cursor.foreground` option sets the desired foreground color, which can be specified using various formats, such as ANSI escape codes or hexadecimal RGB values.'
        cursor.height: |-
            [AI] The `gum` flag `--cursor.height` sets the height of the text cursor in character units when using the `gum` CLI tool for interactive text editing. For instance, you may use it in a GitHub Actions workflow to customize the appearance of the editor window displayed in the console during script execution:

            ```sh
            - name: Run gum command with custom cursor height
              uses: actions/exec@v2
              args: [ "gum", "--cursor.height=3" ]
            ```

            This sets the cursor height to three lines, allowing better visibility when editing text in the console.
        cursor.italic: '[AI] The command `gum file --cursor.italic` is used in the Gum CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for managing terminal output in Node.js projects. This specific command sets the cursor style of the terminal output to italic. This can be useful for highlighting text or drawing attention to certain parts of the output in a visually distinct way.'
        cursor.margin: '[AI] `git config --flag gum file --cursor.margin` is a command used in Git to set or view the value of the "cursor.margin" configuration option for the GIT-Flow and Git Up garage sequences, also known as "Git-Flow Gum" or "Git-Up Gum". This flag allows adjusting the number of characters displayed before and after the current branch tip in the terminal output when using these tools to manage Git branches. A larger margin can make it easier to see which branches are being selected during interactive git operations.'
        cursor.padding: '[AI] The `--cursor.padding` option in the `gum` CLI tool, which is part of the Zigbee2MQTT project, adjusts the size of the cursor that indicates the current position in the output. A larger padding value increases the space around the cursor, making it more visible for users with larger terminals or screens. This can be useful when working with large logs or outputs where locating the current position is challenging.'
        cursor.strikethrough: '[AI] The `--cursor.strikethrough` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to enable or disable strikethrough text cursor style when using the text editor interactively for version control operations like merging or resolving conflicts. When this option is set, the text cursor will appear as a strikethrough line in the terminal, indicating that there are changes to be made in the file or merge conflict to resolve.'
        cursor.underline: '[AI] The command `gum file --cursor.underline` is related to the Gum package in Node.js. It sets the underline mode for the cursor when interacting with a text-based user interface created using Gum. In simple terms, it enables the underlining of the active option or selection when navigating through a list or menu using Gum.'
        cursor.width: '[AI] `gum` is a popular Node.js package used for creating interactive command-line interfaces. The `--cursor.width` option under the `file` command is used to set the width of the text cursor when displaying file listings or other text output. A larger cursor width can make it easier to identify the selected item in a long listing, while a smaller width saves space. The flag takes an integer value representing the desired width. For example, `gum file --cursor.width 5` sets the cursor width to 5 characters.'
        directory: '[AI] The `gum` is a CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool for GitHub actions, and the command `gum file --directory` is used to list files in a given directory of a GitHub repository. This command returns an array containing the relative paths of all directories within the specified directory. It helps in automating tasks related to accessing files or folders in a GitHub repository during GitHub actions workflow execution.'
        directory.align: |-
            [AI] The `gum` command with the argument `--directory.align flag` is used in Git Large File Storage (LFS) for handling large files or directories that are versioned using Git.

            When this flag is provided along with the `gum file add` or `gum file pull` commands, it tells Git LFS to process the given directory recursively and align all files under that directory based on their content, which can lead to more efficient storage and faster cloning or pulling operations.
        directory.background: '[AI] The `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool''s `flag --directory .background` is used to set a specific directory as the background working directory when running a script or command in an interactive session. This flag ensures that any subsequent commands run within the same session will be executed with the specified directory as their base. By default, the CLI uses the current working directory.'
        directory.bold: |-
            [AI] `gum` is a popular Node.js package used for enhancing terminal output with emoji and text styling. The command `gum file --directory .bold` is used to display the current directory in the terminal with bold formatting. Here's a brief explanation:

            1. `gum`: This is the name of the Node.js package.
            2. `file`: This is one of the commands provided by the Gum package, which is used to print file or directory information.
            3. `--directory`: This option is used to specify that we want to display the current directory.
            4. `.`: This represents the current directory.
            5. `bold`: This option is used to apply bold formatting to the output, making the text stand out in the terminal.
        directory.border: '[AI] The `--directory-border` option in the `gum` CLI tool is used to customize the border or margin of text output representing a directory path, when using commands like `gum list`. This flag does not directly interact with files but affects only how their paths are displayed within the terminal. When you run `gum file --directory.border`, it sets up this option and allows you to provide a custom border string for better visual representation of directory trees or lists in your terminal output.'
        directory.border-background: '[AI] The `--directory .border-background` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) command is used to set a custom border background for directories displayed during the interaction with the filesystem in the terminal. The flag modifies the default appearance of directory listings by applying a specified border and background color to the directory names. For instance, it can make the directories stand out more clearly when navigating through the file system. This can be useful for users who prefer a more visually distinct representation of their directories in the terminal interface.'
        directory.border-foreground: '[AI] The `--directory.border-foreground` option in the `gum` CLI command (Command Line Interface) is used to set the foreground color for the border of a directory listing output. When generating a file or directory list using `gum`, this flag can be used to specify the desired color for the border, making it easier to visually distinguish directories from other types of files in the output.'
        directory.faint: '[AI] The `gum` command with the option `--directory faint` is used in Git for Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams created with the GraphViz language in Git repositories. This specific flag sets the visibility level of directories in the UML diagram to be "faint," which means they will be drawn more subtly than other elements, making them less prominent but still visible. It''s often used when there are numerous directories in the diagram and you want to reduce clutter while maintaining a clear representation of the structure.'
        directory.foreground: '[AI] The `gum` flag `--directory.foreground` is used to list the files and directories in the current directory with their corresponding foreground colors based on their types (files are typically displayed in white or other light colors, while directories are shown in blue or cyan). It''s a command for the GUM (Git Utilities for Mac) tool, which is an extension for Git that enhances the terminal experience by providing enhanced listing styles and other utilities.'
        directory.height: '[AI] The `gum` flag `--directory.height` is used to configure the height of the output directory listings displayed by Gum, a popular CLI tool for Git. This flag sets the maximum number of rows to be shown for each directory listing. By default, it''s set to 10, meaning only the first 10 directories will be displayed in a single page. You can increase this value to show more directories per page if needed. For example, `gum flag --directory.height 20` would display 20 directories at once.'
        directory.italic: '[AI] The command `gum file --directory .italic` is using the Gum CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, specifically its `file` subcommand, to determine if the current directory (represented by `.`) contains a directory named `italic`. The `--directory` flag instructs Gum to look for directories instead of files.'
        directory.margin: '[AI] The `--directory-margin` option in the `gum` CLI tool (Command Line Interface) is used to configure the display of directory listings. It sets the number of columns that will be used for displaying file and directory names within each line of the output, leaving the remaining columns for other information such as permissions and sizes. The default value is 20, but it can be adjusted with this option. For example, `gum --directory-margin 30` would set the margin to 30 columns.'
        directory.padding: '[AI] The `--directory-padding` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to specify the number of characters to use for padding when displaying a directory listing. The flag takes an integer value as its argument, indicating the desired length of padding per entry in the directory listing. For example, `--directory-padding 3` would add three spaces before each file or directory name in the output. This can be useful for making the output more visually appealing or easier to read when dealing with long filenames or deep directory hierarchies.'
        directory.strikethrough: '[AI] The command `gum flag --directory .strikethrough` is used with the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool in Node.js for managing terminal output formatting. The `--directory` option is used to apply formatting rules specifically to directories listed in the output, while the `.strikethrough` flag sets the style to strikethrough for those directories. This results in the directory names being displayed with a line through them when they are listed in the terminal output.'
        directory.underline: |-
            [AI] The `--directory-underline` option is not a valid command or flag for `gum`, which is a popular Node.js library for creating interactive CLI applications. Instead, it seems like an incorrect combination of options.

            The correct usage of the `gum` library's `--directory` option is as follows:

            ```bash
            gum install <package-name> --directory <output-directory>
            ```

            This command installs a Gum package and extracts it to the specified output directory. The default output directory is `./node_modules/.gum`, but you can change it by providing the `--directory` option.

            For example, if you have a package named `my-package` and you want to install it in the `my-app/lib` directory, you can run:

            ```bash
            npm install gum --save-dev
            gum install my-package --directory my-app/lib
            ```

            This command will install both the 'gum' and 'my-package' packages, and extract 'my-package' to the `my-app/lib` directory.
        directory.width: '[AI] The `--directory-width` option is a command-line argument used with the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, specifically when working with the `file` subcommand. This flag sets the maximum width for displaying directory paths in output. It helps to adjust the terminal window''s dimensions and makes it easier to read long directory paths without truncation or scrolling horizontally.'
        file: '[AI] `gum` is a command-line tool for GitHubActions and Node.js projects, which allows users to create reusable actions and modify YAML files in a GitHub repository. The `--file` option is used with the `gum file` command to specify the path to the target YAML file for modification or creation. For example, `gum file --file .github/workflows/my-workflow.yml` would modify or create the specified workflow file in a GitHub repository.'
        file-size.align: '[AI] The `--file-size.align` option in GUM (Git Unified Model), a Git porcelain tool, is used to align the output file sizes to a specified unit (byte, kilobyte, megabyte, or gigabyte) when displaying the size information of files in Git history or diff output. For example, `gum file --file-size --unit=M` will display file sizes in Megabytes.'
        file-size.background: '[AI] The `--flag "gum file --file-size.background"` is a command used with Gum, a popular interactive CLI tool for Node.js. This specific flag is used to filter files based on their background size in bytes. When using this flag, Gum will only display or interact with files that meet the specified background size requirement. For example, if you use `--file-size.background 10M`, Gum will only show files with a background size of at least 10 megabytes. This can help simplify and focus the interaction with large file systems.'
        file-size.bold: '[AI] The command `gum flag --file-size.bold` is used in the Gum CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for GitHub actions to display the file size in bold text format. The ".bold" modifier makes the output appear in bold format, making it easier to distinguish from other output in a terminal or command line interface. The `gum flag --file-size` command displays the size of the file being processed by Gum during GitHub actions workflow execution.'
        file-size.border: '[AI] The `--file-size.border` flag is used with the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for GitHub actions, specifically with the `gum file` command. This flag sets a border around the output of the `--file-size` option, which displays the size of files in a GitHub repository. The border helps distinguish the output from other console text and makes it easier to read.'
        file-size.border-background: '[AI] The `--flag "gum file --file-size.border-background"` is a command-line option for the GUM (Git Universal Magic) library, used in Git-like tools such as Excelasión or Riot. This flag sets the border background color based on the file size when displaying a list of files. The larger the file size, the more prominent the background color will be, helping users quickly identify large files.'
        file-size.border-foreground: '[AI] The `--file-size` option under `gum`''s `flag` command is used to filter files based on their size. The `border-foreground` part refers to the styling of the output border in a terminal table. It doesn''t directly affect the file processing, but rather changes how the resulting table looks when displayed in the terminal.'
        file-size.faint: '[AI] The `gum` command is a part of the `GNU Coreutils` package, which provides various file handling utilities. The option `--file-size --faint` is used to display file size information in a compact and faint format. With this option, file sizes are displayed using a suffix (K, M, G etc.) instead of the more verbose "X KB" or "Y MB" format. For example, "1K", "5M", "2G". The "--faint" option makes sure that the output is displayed in a faint mode, meaning that the colors used are muted and less prominent.'
        file-size.foreground: '[AI] The `--flag "gum file --file-size.foreground"` is a command flag used with the GUM (Graphical User Interface for MacOS) library for Node.js. This specific flag instructs GUM to display the size of a file in foreground color when listing files or directories in the terminal interface. It does not affect the functionality of the `file` command itself, but rather how the output is presented.'
        file-size.height: |-
            [AI] The `gum` command with the option `--file-size.height` is used to get the height of files in size represented in units of 1024 bytes (KB), 1024 KB (MB), or 1024 MB (GB).

            For example, if you run `gum file --file-size.height path/to/your/file`, it will return the height (in GB) of the specified file. This can be useful for quickly assessing the size of large files or directories within a Node.js pipeline.
        file-size.italic: '[AI] The command `gum flag --file-size .italic` is used with the `gum` CLI tool to filter files based on their size. The `--file-size` flag specifies this filtering criterion, and the `.italic` argument is a glob pattern representing the desired file extensions. In this case, only files with the .italic extension will be considered when applying the size filter. This command can help in managing or analyzing files based on their sizes and types.'
        file-size.margin: '[AI] The `--file-size.margin` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to set a margin for displaying file size information. This means that when listing files with `gum`, any difference between file sizes less than this margin will be considered as having the same size and displayed as a single entry. For example, if you set a 10MB margin, files of size 9MB and 11MB will both be displayed as "around 10MB". This can make the output cleaner and easier to read when dealing with many files of similar sizes.'
        file-size.padding: '[AI] The `--file-size.padding` option in GUM (Git Unified Model), a Git porcelain tool, is used to pad the output of the `file-size` command with leading zeroes up to a specified length. This is useful for displaying file sizes as a fixed width, making the output more visually consistent and easier to read when comparing files across different repositories or commits. For example, with `--file-size.padding=5`, a 123 byte file would be displayed as "00123" instead of just "123".'
        file-size.strikethrough: '[AI] The `--file-size.strikethrough` flag is a command-line option used with the PowerShell `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet, specifically when using its alias `gcm` or `gci`. When this option is included, it modifies the output of the cmdlet to display file sizes in a strikethrough format. This represents files whose sizes are smaller than a previously specified threshold. The flag helps to easily identify and manage those files that have been reduced in size compared to their previous states.'
        file-size.underline: '[AI] The `--file-size --underline` option is used with the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for Node.js, specifically for the `list` command. This option underlines the file size output in the terminal list display, making it easier to visually identify larger files.'
        file-size.width: '[AI] The command `gum flag --file-size.width` is used in Gum, a Node.js library for creating interactive CLI applications. This specific flag sets the width of the file size display in characters. For instance, if you set it to 5, file sizes will be displayed as "10MB" instead of "10485760 bytes".'
        file.align: '[AI] `gum` is a command-line tool for GitHub''s Git Large File Storage (LFS). The `--file` option followed by a file path specifies which local file to process with Git LFS. The `--file.align` option is used to align the chunks of data in the file before sending them to Git LFS. This option can improve compression and reduce network bandwidth usage when dealing with large binary files, especially those that have aligned data such as images or video files.'
        file.background: '[AI] The `gum` flag `--file --file.background` is used in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for handling JSON files. This specific flag combination is used to read and load a background file, which typically contains default or global settings, before processing the primary file using `gum`. In other words, it allows merging the configurations from both files, with the background file having precedence over the primary one.'
        file.bold: '[AI] The command `gum flag --file.bold` is related to the Gum CLI (Command Line Interface) library for Node.js, which provides interactive prompts and validation for user input. This specific command is used to set the file path argument as bold in the prompt. It does not affect the file itself but only changes its visual representation during the interactive process.'
        file.border: '[AI] The `gum` flag `--file --file.border` is used in Git-based tools like `git-diff`, `hub`, or `fzf`. It specifies that the command should operate on a file named `file` and only display differences related to its border or file metadata such as permissions, ownership, or timestamps. In other words, it shows changes to the file''s header information but not the contents of the file itself.'
        file.border-background: |-
            [AI] The command `gum file --file.border-background` is related to the Gum CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for handling files in Node.js projects, especially those using the Gatsby framework. This command is used to set or get the border and background color properties of a specific file's image.

            The `--file` flag indicates that you are working with a file, while `.border-background` specifies that you want to manipulate its border and background properties. The `--file.border-background` flag is used to retrieve or set the values for both properties together as an object containing 'borderColor' and 'backgroundColor' keys.
        file.border-foreground: '[AI] The command `gum flag file --file.border-foreground` is used with the Gum CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for GitOps, which is designed to interactively manage Kubernetes resources. This specific command sets the border-foreground color of a given file''s display in the Gum terminal interface. The flag `--file` specifies that the configuration applies to a file resource, while `--file.border-foreground` sets the border foreground color for the visual representation of the file in the terminal. This can help users easily differentiate between various resources when managing their Kubernetes clusters with Gum.'
        file.faint: '[AI] The `gum` command with the flag `--file` followed by a filename (`file.faint` in this case) is used to load that file into Git Ultimate Mate (Git-Ur-Mate or GUM), an enhanced Git command-line interface. The `--file` flag specifies the path to the file containing configurations, scripts or other customizations for GUM. In simple terms, it allows you to customize GUM functionality with external files.'
        file.foreground: '[AI] The `gum` flag `--file --foreground` is used to run a Gum.js script file in interactive mode with its output displayed in the terminal''s foreground instead of appending it to a log file. This command instructs Gum.js to read and execute the specified file (`--file.filepath`) as the main script, while displaying any output directly in the console.'
        file.height: '[AI] The command `gum flag --file.height` is used in Gum, a popular CLI library for Node.js, to retrieve the height of a given file. The `flag` part refers to using one of Gum''s built-in functions called `flag`. This function checks and parses command line arguments, and in this case, it is being used specifically to read the `--file.height` argument. The argument consists of two parts: `--file`, which indicates that the following argument is a file path, and `.height`, which specifies that the height of the file (in bytes) should be returned.'
        file.italic: '[AI] The `gum` flag `--file --file.italic` is used with the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for managing files in Git repositories. Specifically, it''s an option to display a file in italic font when listing files. This can make it easier to identify and manage files that are related to text formatting or markdown content within the Git context.'
        file.margin: '[AI] The `--file` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to specify a file or a list of files to be processed. The `--file.margin` option, specifically, sets the margin size for JSON files being displayed with `gum`. This option is useful when dealing with large or nested JSON data structures where readability can be improved by adding whitespace between elements. The value for `--file.margin` can be set as a number (in characters) or a string specifying an indentation style, such as "2" for a 2-character margin or "tabs: 4" for a tab indentation of 4 units.'
        file.padding: '[AI] The `gum flag --file --padding` is a command used with the Gum CLI (Command Line Interface) tool in Node.js. This specific flag is responsible for adding padding, usually whitespace or indentation, to the displayed output of a file''s contents when piping it into Gum. By providing the `--file` argument followed by the file path and the optional `--padding` argument with the desired padding value, the command ensures that the file data is neatly formatted when being displayed in the terminal.'
        file.strikethrough: '[AI] The `gum` CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool is a popular choice for creating interactive command line applications using Node.js. The command `gum file --file.strikethrough` can be used to apply strikethrough formatting to the specified file within the context of a `gum` workflow. This command does not directly modify the file content, but instead sets the metadata of the given file to indicate that its contents should be displayed with strikethrough formatting when rendered in an interactive terminal session or other supported output format. The actual implementation of the strikethrough rendering is typically handled by the specific rendering engine used by the `gum` workflow, rather than the command itself.'
        file.underline: |-
            [AI] The `gum` flag `--file --file.underline` is used in the context of the GUM (Git Understanding Magic) CLI tool for Git version control systems. This flag is a combination of two separate flags: `--file` and `--underline`.

            The `--file` flag tells GUM to show information related to a specific file, such as its Git history or differences between versions. The `--underline` flag, on the other hand, instructs GUM to underline the names of branches, tags, or commits in the output that are not currently checked out or active.

            Together, these flags allow you to inspect the Git history and differences for a particular file while also having the branch/tag/commit names clearly distinguished from your current context.
        file.width: '[AI] The command `gum flag file --file.width` is used in GitUp (Gum) Git GUI tool to set or view the width of the file display in the text editor when staging or committing files using GitUp.

        permissions.align: |-
            [AI] The `gum` command is a popular Node.js package used for interacting with the filesystem in a Unix-like way. The specific command `gum file --permissions.align` is used to adjust the permissions of files or directories so that their permissions are aligned along certain bit patterns. For instance, if you want all your files to have the same read, write and execute permissions for user, group and others, you can use this command:

            ```bash
            gum file --permissions.set 755 # for example, setting permissions to rwxr-xr-x for owner, group and others respectively
            ```

            The `--permissions.align` option is used to ensure that the permissions of all files or directories under a given directory have their permission bits aligned in a specific way. For example:

            ```bash
            gum file --recursive --permissions.align 755 # sets permissions for all files and subdirectories recursively, aligning them to rwxr-xr-x
            ```
        permissions.background: |-
            [AI] The `gum` is a CLI (Command Line Interface) utility for Node.js, used to interactively handle files and directories in the terminal. The command `gum file --permissions.background` is used to change the background permissions of a file or a set of files.

            Background permissions refer to the file access rights when the application running the file is not in focus or the system is hibernating. By default, Node.js processes don't have the necessary background execution permissions. This command allows you to grant these permissions by setting the `background` flag with the desired value (e.g., `true`) in the `--permissions` option while working with `gum file`. This enables the specified files to run as background jobs, allowing them to continue their tasks even when the terminal or Node.js process is not active.
        permissions.bold: |-
            [AI] `gum` is a popular Node.js library used for enhancing the output of various Node.js commands in the terminal. The specific command `gum file --permissions.bold` is not a standalone command but an extension used with other file system commands like `fs`, `chmod`, etc.

            This extension modifies the output of file permissions by making the permission symbols (r, w, x, s) and their respective owner, group, and others fields bold in the terminal for better readability. This can be useful when dealing with complex file permissions, especially in larger projects or scripts where understanding the exact file permissions at a glance is important.
        permissions.border: '[AI] The `--permissions.border` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to set custom permissions for files and directories, beyond the standard read, write, execute permissions. It allows you to specify the Unix file permission bits using a border or box representation. For example, `--permissions.border 755` sets read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, and read and execute permissions for all other users. This is equivalent to the octal representation `01111110111`.'
        permissions.border-background: '[AI] The `--permissions.border-background` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to configure the border and background colors for the output of file permissions when using the `gum file --permissions` command. This option takes a hexadecimal color code or named color as its argument, allowing users to customize the appearance of the output for better visibility and readability.'
        permissions.border-foreground: '[AI] The `gum` CLI tool''s `file` command with the `--permissions` option and the `border-foreground` argument is used to update or query the Unix file permissions for the border and foreground color of the file''s name in a terminal listing. This doesn''t actually change the file permissions themselves, but rather how they are displayed in a terminal with support for colored borders. The specific permission values that control the border and foreground colors can vary depending on the terminal or shell configuration, but typically involve using the `umask` command or setting terminal escape sequences.'
        permissions.faint: |-
            [AI] The `gum` is a CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool used for managing files and directories in Node.js. The command `gum file --permissions.faint` is specifically related to modifying the file permissions with a less verbose output.

            With the `--permissions.faint` flag, the output of the `gum file` command when setting or changing file permissions will be in a more compact format. Instead of displaying the full permission string (e.g., `rwxr-xr-x`), it shows only the first character for each set of permissions:

            * `r` for read,
            * `w` for write, and
            * `x` for execute.

            This flag is useful when dealing with multiple files or complex permission settings and you want a more succinct output.
        permissions.foreground: |-
            [AI] The `gum` command is a popular Node.js package for creating interactive prompts in the terminal. The `--permissions.foreground` option is related to setting file permissions in this context.

            When running a script with `gum`, you may want to update the execution permissions of files that are being used or created during its runtime. With `--permissions.foreground`, you can set specific file permissions (usually read, write and execute) for the user executing the script in the foreground.

            For instance, if a script creates a file called "data.txt" and needs to update its execution permission, you can use:

            ```bash
            gum install <package-name> -- ... --permissions.foreground "755 data.txt"
            ```

            The `755` value sets read, write, and execute permissions for the owner (user), while setting only read permissions for other users. This can help ensure that your script interacts correctly with the specified file(s).
        permissions.height: |-
            [AI] The `gum` command is a popular Node.js library for creating interactive prompts and validators for CLI applications. The `--permissions.height` option, when used with this library, sets the height of the permissions display in the terminal.

            When you run a `gum` command with a list of possible selections and each selection has associated file system permissions, by default, these permissions will be displayed alongside their corresponding selections. The `--permissions.height` option allows you to control the number of lines used for displaying these permissions. A higher value results in more detailed permission displays, while a lower value limits the information shown.
        permissions.italic: '[AI] The `gum` is a Node.js package for interactive CLI prompts. The command `gum file --permissions .italic` is used to change the file permissions of the current directory (`.`) and its contents recursively (`-R` implied), setting the italic text bit for the ownership and other permission bits in the output only, not affecting the actual file permissions. It does not modify the executable or setuid/setgid bits.'
        permissions.margin: |-
            [AI] The `--permissions.margin` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to set the permissions display margin for the output of the `gum file` command. This command is used to list the files and directories with their size, ownership, and permission information.

            The `--permissions.margin` option sets the number of spaces that will be displayed before the file permissions string. For example, a common value for this option is 10 (spaces), which results in the output looking like:

            ```bash
            -rw-r--r--  1 user group size
            ```

            By default, `gum file` does not have any margin set and the permissions string will be displayed directly next to the file name. Setting a positive integer value for `--permissions.margin` will add that number of spaces before the permissions string. Setting a negative integer value can be used to subtract that number of spaces from the default margin.
        permissions.padding: '[AI] The `--permissions.padding` option in `gum` is used to control the number of spaces added between the file permissions and the filename when displaying file info. By default, `gum` adds one space. If you want to add more or no spaces at all, you can use this option. For example, `gum file --permissions.padding=3` will add three spaces between the permissions and the filename.'
        permissions.strikethrough: '[AI] The `gum` CLI tool''s `flag --permissions.strikethrough` modifies the output of its `ls-tree` command to display permissions with strikethrough for deleted files or directories, indicating which items will be removed during a Git operation such as merge or rebase conflict resolution.'
        permissions.underline: '[AI] The `gum` is a command-line tool for managing files and directories in Node.js. The option `--permissions.underline` is used to display permission settings in an underlined format when listing files or directories. It does not change the permissions themselves, but only affects how they are displayed. For example, instead of seeing "drwxr-xr-x", you would see "drwxr-xr-x----". This can be useful for quickly identifying the exact permissions for each file or directory in a list.'
        permissions.width: '[AI] The `--permissions.width` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to specify the width of the output format for displaying file permissions. This option allows users to adjust the display width according to their terminal size or preference, enabling a clearer view of the file permissions.'
        selected.align: |-
            [AI] The `gum file --selected.align` command is a PowerShell cmdlet used in the Git-Unified-Model (Gum) tool for Git repository management. This command displays the alignment of the selected hunks or changesets in a merge conflict within the Visual Studio Code Git Diff editor.

            The selected hunks represent parts of files that have been modified on different branches and need to be merged. The --selected.align flag shows the differences between these selected hunks side by side, with matching lines highlighted for easy comparison and modification. This command helps users resolve merge conflicts efficiently by allowing them to review and adjust the changes before committing them back to the repository.
        selected.background: '[AI] `gum` is a popular Node.js library for creating interactive command-line interfaces.

        selected.border: '[AI] The command `gum file --selected.border` is used in PowerShell with the Git Unified Model (Gum) module for interacting with Git repositories. This specific command is used to display the border around the selected hunks or changesets in a Git diff or merge conflict window. It does not modify the repository but only shows the visual representation of the selected changes, making it easier to review and select which parts to apply or discard during merging or resolving conflicts.'
        selected.border-background: '[AI] The command `gum file --selected.border-background` is used in Gum, a Node.js library for handling interactive CLI applications. This specific command sets the border background color of the currently selected item in the application''s interface. It does not display anything when executed on its own but instead modifies the appearance of the selected element within the Gum-powered application.'
        selected.border-foreground: '[AI] The `--selected.border-foreground` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to set the foreground color for the border of a selected item when using the tool. The gum flag `file --selected` refers to the file interaction mode, specifically the selection of files or directories within the context of the tool. By modifying the `--selected.border-foreground` property, users can customize the appearance of their selected items for better visibility and usability within the terminal interface.'
        selected.faint: |-
            [AI] The command `gum flag --selected.faint` is used in Git Unified Merge (GUM) tool, which is a graphical merging tool for resolving merge conflicts in Git.

            The `--selected.faint` option modifies the display of the selected hunks or changesets in the merge conflict window. The term "faint" indicates that the text color used to display the selected items will be less intense compared to other non-selected items, making it easier for users to distinguish between them.

            This command is particularly helpful when there are many hunks or changesets involved in a conflict and you want to quickly identify which ones have been selected for merging. By setting the display option to "faint," the selected items will stand out from the rest while still maintaining a clear distinction between them.
        selected.foreground: '[AI] The `--selected.foreground` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to set the foreground color of a selected item in a terminal interface. When an item is selected or highlighted, this option changes its appearance by applying a specific color or style. This can enhance the user experience and make it easier to navigate menus or identify chosen items within a list or table.'
        selected.height: |-
            [AI] The command `gum flag explain --selected.height` is used in Gum, a popular Node.js library for creating interactive CLI applications. This specific flag request explains the meaning and functionality of the `--selected.height` option.

            In essence, `--selected.height` is an input flag that accepts a numerical value. It sets the height of the default text editor used by Gum when a user is prompted to edit or input data interactively. By providing this flag with a value during command execution, users can customize the editor's dimensions to better suit their needs.
        selected.italic: '[AI] `gum` is a tool for managing and interacting with GitHub issues and pull requests from the command line. The command `gum file --selected.italic` is used to mark a selected file in a GitHub issue or pull request as italicized. This can help draw attention to specific files when reporting or discussing issues with others.'
        selected.margin: |-
            [AI] The `gum` command is a popular Git utility for managing and interacting with files in Git repositories, especially in terminal or command-line interfaces. The `--selected.margin` option is used to customize the display of selected files in Gum's output by adjusting the left margin.

            When working with multiple files in a Git repository, Gum displays them in a list format. By default, the leftmost column shows file paths with an indentation of 3 spaces or one tab character, indicating the folder hierarchy within the repository. The `--selected.margin` option allows you to change this display by specifying a number representing the desired margin width.

            For instance, if you want to increase the selected files' left margin by 5 spaces, use:

            ```bash
            gum file --selected.margin=5
            ```

            This will display the selected files with an additional margin of 5 spaces in the output list. The same logic applies for decreasing the margin width or using other types of characters instead of spaces.
        selected.padding: '[AI] The `--selected.padding` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool relates to the visual representation of selected items in a list or table output. Specifically, it sets the number of columns on each side of the selected item''s border for padding. For instance, if you use `--selected.padding 2`, it will add two spaces between the border and the content of the selected item. This can help improve the readability and clarity when dealing with long selections in textual interfaces.'
        selected.strikethrough: '[AI] The `--selected.strikethrough` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to apply a strikethrough text formatting to the currently selected text when working with files or text editors. This modification visually marks the selected text as deleted or struck out, making it clear for users to identify and distinguish it from other parts of the text.'
        selected.underline: '[AI] The command `gum file --selected.underline` is a PowerShell cmdlet used with the Gum Psychological and Productivity Shell. It specifically modifies the appearance of the selected item in the Gum shell''s output, underlining it for improved visibility.

This information can be useful for automating interactions with files or understanding the visual representation of repositories.'
        symlink.align: '[AI] The `gum` command with the option `--symlink.align` is used in Git to realign a Git repository''s local and remote branches when there have been new upstream symlinks created between the last fetch and the current git pull operation. This ensures that local symlinks are kept in sync with their upstream counterparts. The alignment is achieved by creating or updating symlinks locally based on the latest information from the remote repository.'
        symlink.background: |-
            [AI] The `gum` is a popular CLI (Command Line Interface) library for Node.js used to create interactive and beautiful terminal outputs. The command `gum file --symlink.background` specifically checks if the current file is a symbolic link and, if it is, whether it points to a directory with a background process running.

            Here's a brief explanation of each component:

            - `gum`: A Node.js library for building interactive CLI applications.
            - `file`: A subcommand provided by the gum library for working with files.
            - `--symlink`: An option used to detect if the current file is a symbolic link.
            - `.background`: An additional option that checks if the target of the symlink (the real file) is a directory and if it has any background processes running.
        symlink.bold: |-
            [AI] `gum` is a popular Node.js package for creating beautiful, interactive CLI interfaces. The `--symlink.bold` option is not a flag of `gum` itself but rather an option for its theme, which is called "symlink."

            This option makes the text "symlink" appear in bold when it's displayed during the CLI interaction. This can help improve the visibility and readability of the command or message related to symlinks within the terminal output.
        symlink.border: |-
            [AI] The `--symlink` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to manage symbolic links in Git repositories. The `border` argument specifically refers to managing symbolic links at a specific location within a repository, often denoted as a branch or directory.

            In summary, `gum file --symlink [path] --symlink.border [new-link-name]` creates a new symbolic link named `[new-link-name]` at the current location specified by `[path]` within the Git repository. This command does not actually create or update files, but instead only manages the symbolic links themselves.
        symlink.border-background: '[AI] The `gum` command is a popular Node.js package for creating interactive CLI experiences. The option `--symlink` is used when dealing with Git files, and it follows the symlinks in the given path during the file operation. The specific flag `border-background` likely refers to the appearance of the border around the output of the command when using the `gum` package''s visual interface. However, the exact functionality of this flag depends on the specific implementation of the `gum` command or custom script using it. In summary, the `--symlink.border-background` option configures the appearance of the border around the output of Git operations within a `gum` CLI interaction.'
        symlink.border-foreground: |-
            [AI] The `gum` is a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for Git, specifically designed for managing Git files and directories. The given command, `gum file --symlink <file> --symlink.border-foreground`, is used to manipulate Git symlinks (also known as Git aliases or Git junctions).

            Here's a breakdown of the components:

            1. `gum`: This is the name of the command-line tool.
            2. `file`: This tells `gum` to operate on files and not other types of Git objects, such as branches or tags.
            3. `--symlink <file>`: This option instructs `gum` to manage symlinks for the specified file, which is <file>.
            4. `--symlink.border-foreground`: This additional option sets the color of symlinked files in the Git status output to be displayed in the foreground (on the same color level as regular files). By default, symlinked files are shown with a border around them in the background.
        symlink.faint: '[AI] `gum` is a popular Git alias manager for PowerShell and cmd. The command `gum file --symlink.faint` is used to list all symbolic links (symlinks) defined in the `gum.ps1` or `gum.cmd` file with minimal output. The `--faint` option reduces the amount of output to just the names of the symlinks without any additional formatting or colors.'
        symlink.foreground: '[AI] The `gum` command is a popular Git alias creation tool for PowerShell and Windows Command Line. The specific command `gum file --symlink.foreground` is used to create or manage a Git alias that creates or manages foreground file system symbols links (also known as "shortcuts" in some contexts) within the current working directory, pointing to files located in the repository. The `--symlink` flag specifies the creation or management of symbolic links and the `--foreground` flag indicates that the operation should be performed in the foreground, meaning the command will not continue until the operation is completed.'
        symlink.height: '[AI] The `--symlink.height` option in the `git` command `flag "gum file --symlink"` is used to control the number of levels deep Git follows when resolving symbolic links during a file comparison using GUM (Git Unified Model) library. By default, it follows up to three levels deep. Increasing this value will allow Git to follow more symbolic link levels, potentially revealing deeper relationships between files with symlinks.'
        symlink.italic: |-
            [AI] `gum` is a popular CLI (Command-Line Interface) library for Node.js used for creating interactive, text-based user interfaces. The command `gum file --symlink.italic` doesn't exist as a built-in command within the `gum` library itself. It seems like there might be some confusion with the syntax or an incorrect combination of commands.

            If we break down the given command, here's what we can infer:

            1. `gum file`: This suggests that this command is related to the `gum` library and dealing specifically with files (as opposed to directories or other types). However, this isn't a valid command in the standard `gum` library.

            2. `--symlink`: This flag indicates that the command might be dealing with handling symlinks (symbolic links), which are used in file systems for representing one file as another file.

            3. `italic`: The purpose of this term is unclear without additional context. In general, it refers to a typographic style where text appears slanted to the right at an angle. However, there doesn't seem to be any connection between this and handling symlinks in a CLI command.

            In summary, the `gum file --symlink.italic` command isn't valid within the standard `gum` library, as it consists of several parts that don't align with known functionality or syntax within the library. It's likely a combination of incorrect commands or an error in understanding the intended usage.
        symlink.margin: '[AI] The `--symlink` option with `git checkout` or `git restore` in Git is used to manage symbolic links in a Git repository. The `--margin` option, when used with this flag, sets the length of the symlink''s target path that will be kept when checking out or restoring a file as a symlink. By default, no margin is specified and Git attempts to keep the entire target path. However, using `--symlink margin=N` allows you to specify a custom margin value (an integer number) indicating how many characters from the beginning of the target path Git should leave untouched. This can be useful in managing larger or more complex symlinked paths while performing Git operations.'
        symlink.padding: |-
            [AI] `gum` is a popular CLI (Command-Line Interface) library for Node.js used for creating beautiful and interactive terminal output. The `--symlink.padding` option is not a flag specific to the `gum file` command but rather an option that can be passed to change the padding behavior of symlink display.

            When using `gum file`, you might display the list of files in your current directory or other directories. With `--symlink.padding`, you can control how much space is displayed before and after a symlink arrow `→` symbol, allowing for better alignment and readability of the output. For example:

            - `gum file --symlink.padding 2`: Increases the vertical padding between lines by 2 characters.
            - `gum file --symlink.padding 0`: Disables any padding.

            This option helps customize the terminal output to your preference and ensures a clean and visually appealing display of the file listing with symlinks.
        symlink.strikethrough: '[AI] The `--symlink.strikethrough` option is a command-line argument for Git''s `flag` sub-command when using the `gum` utility. This option is used to visually represent broken symlinks in the Git diff output with a strikethrough text, making it clearer to identify and handle issues related to broken symlinks during a Git merge or pull request process. It doesn''t modify any files or make changes; instead, it only alters how the output is displayed for easier identification of broken symlinks within the Git diff context.'
        symlink.underline: '[AI] The `gum` is a CLI tool for GitHub Updater for Mac, and the command `gum file --symlink underline` creates or updates a symbolic link named "underline" in the current directory that points to the corresponding Git repository file or folder located in the user''s GitHub directory. This command makes it easier to access frequently used files or folders without navigating deep into the GitHub directory hierarchy.'
        symlink.width: '[AI] The `--symlink.width` option in the `git` command `flag "gum file --symlink"` is used to control the width of the output display for symbolic links in Git''s diff and status commands. By default, Git only shows the name of the symlinked file, but with this option, you can increase the width to also display the target of the symlink. For example, `--symlink.width=m` will show up to 10 characters (m for meters) of the target path, and `--symlink.width=5` will show up to 5 characters. This option helps provide more context when working with Git repositories that contain symbolic links.'
        timeout: '[AI] The `--timeout` option in the `gum` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to set a time limit for a specific command or action being performed. When this option is passed, Gum will wait for the specified amount of time before throwing an error and terminating the process if the command hasn''t completed. This can be helpful when dealing with slow or unresponsive commands in scripts or automated workflows, preventing them from blocking further execution.'
