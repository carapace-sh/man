            ```sh
            swaylock --ring-color=#ff5722
            ```

            This command sets the ring color to Tomato (#ff5722).
        ring-ver-color: '[AI] `swaylock` is a tiling window manager locker for Wayland. The command `--ring-ver-color` is an option that sets the color of the version number ring during the screensaver''s countdown sequence. This option helps distinguish between different versions of the screensaver when it is active.'
        ring-wrong-color: '[AI] `swaylock` is a tiling window manager for Wayland compositors that provides a lock screen functionality. The option `--ring-wrong-color` is used to set the color of the circular progress bar around the lock icon in the ring, which indicates the status of the lock process, to a specified wrong color.

This will display the version message in red color on the lock screen.'
        text-wrong-color: '[AI] `swaylock` is a graphical lock screen for Wayland compositors like Sway. The `--text-wrong-color` option is used to set an incorrect text color for the lock screen, making it harder for an attacker to read the password if they manage to gain access to the login screen. It does not change the functionality of the lock screen itself but adds a security feature by obscuring the text.'
        tiling: '[AI] `swaylock` is a tiling window manager locker for Wayland compositors, such as Sway. The `--tiling` option enables tiling mode, which arranges windows in predefined layouts (splitting the screen into areas of equal or variable sizes) and maximizes their usage.
