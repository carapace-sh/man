documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul acl token delete` command is used to remove an Access Control List (ACL) token from Consul, a distributed configuration and orchestration tool. When this command is executed, it revokes the permissions associated with the specified token and makes it unusable for securing access to Consul''s API. The command requires providing the token ID or name as its argument to identify which token should be deleted. For example: `consul acl tokens delete <token-id>` or `consul acl tokens delete <token-name>`.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] The `consul acl token delete --ca-file` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) token from Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. The `--ca-file` flag specifies the path to a file containing the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate to authenticate the request. This command requires Consul to be configured with TLS encryption, and the CA certificate is used to verify the identity of the client making the request.'
        ca-path: '[AI] The `consul acl token delete --ca-path` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) token from Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool. The `--ca-path` option specifies the path to the CA (Certificate Authority) file that will be used to authenticate the request. This command deletes the token by validating the client''s certificate against the provided CA file before performing the delete operation.'
        client-cert: '[AI] The `consul acl token delete --client-cert` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) token in the Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. The `--client-cert` option specifies that the deletion request should be signed with a client certificate, providing an additional layer of security. This command helps ensure that only authorized entities can modify or remove ACL tokens from the Consul server.'
        client-key: '[AI] The `consul acl token delete --client-key` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command is utilized to delete an Access Control List (ACL) token based on its client key. ACL tokens represent permissions granted to clients in a Consul datacenter. By supplying the `--client-key` flag followed by the unique client key of the token, this command will remove that specific token from Consul''s access control configuration.'
        datacenter: '[AI] The `consul acl token delete --datacenter` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) token in Hashicorp Consul, a service discovery, configuration, and orchestration tool. The `--datacenter` flag specifies the name of the datacenter where the Consul server is running. This command allows you to securely revoke access granted by an ACL token without requiring access to the Consul UI or CLI credentials. Once a token is deleted, any services or configurations protected by that token will no longer be accessible.'
        http-addr: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl token delete` command is used to remove an Access Control List (ACL) token from Consul, which is an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. The `--http-addr` option specifies the Consul HTTP API address where this operation will be performed.

            So, in summary, `consul acl token delete --http-addr <API_ADDRESS>` deletes an ACL token from Consul using the given HTTP API address.
        id: '[AI] The `consul acl token delete --id` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) token from Consul, a connectivity and configuration management tool. The `--id` option specifies the unique identifier of the token to be deleted. When executed, this command removes the specified ACL token from Consul''s access control policy, revoking its associated permissions.'
        namespace: '[AI] The `consul acl token delete --namespace` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) token in Consul, which is a connectivity and configuration management tool. The `--namespace` flag specifies the namespace where the token was created. This command is typically used when it''s necessary to revoke access granted by the token for managing resources within that namespace.'
        stale: '[AI] The `consul acl token delete --stale` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command deletes ACL (Access Control List) tokens that have been stale, meaning they have not been renewed within the configured time period, typically 90 days by default. Deleting stale tokens helps maintain security by revoking access that is no longer needed.'
        tls-server-name: '[AI] The `consul acl token delete --tls-server-name` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) token from Consul, which is a connectivity and configuration management tool. The `--tls-server-name` option specifies the TLS name or address of the Consul server to connect to for performing this operation. This command is typically run by an administrator with appropriate privileges, allowing them to manage ACL tokens in their Consul environment. Once a token is deleted, any associated permissions and access will no longer be granted.'
        token: '[AI] The `consul acl token delete --token` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) token from Consul, a Connective Dots'' service discovery, configuration, and orchestration tool. Consul uses tokens for securing access to its HTTP API. By specifying the token argument in this command, you are instructing Consul to revoke the permissions associated with that token, effectively disabling it and preventing any further access using it.'
        token-file: '[AI] The `consul acl token delete` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) token from Hashicorp Consul, which is a connectivity and Orchestration tool for service discovery, configuration, and security. The `--token-file` flag specifies the file path containing the token to be deleted. This command removes the access permissions associated with the token, making it no longer valid for securing interactions between Consul clients or services.'
