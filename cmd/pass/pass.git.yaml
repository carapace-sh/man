documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "pass git" is not a valid Git command. "Git" is a popular version control system, and "pass" is a separate utility for managing secure passwords in Unix-based systems using the GPG encryption. If you meant to enter your Git password or access key using the `git-credential-cache` helper, try running `git config --global credential.helper cache` first, then use `git push` or `git pull` without entering the password each time. If you meant to pass an argument to Git, use `git <command> <arguments>`.'
