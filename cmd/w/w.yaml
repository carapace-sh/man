documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `w` command in Unix-based systems displays who is currently logged in and what they are doing on the system. It provides a list of active users, their terminal or connection details, and the processes running on their sessions. This can be useful for checking system activity, identifying potential intrusions, or locating running processes belonging to other users.'
    flag:
        from: '[AI] The `w --from` flag is used in Docker to create a new container from an existing container''s filesystem writeable. This means that the new container will have access to the same file system layers as the original container, allowing for easy copying of files or running commands on the same base image with different configurations. It does not create a new image but only a new container.'
        help: '[AI] The `--help` flag is a common option used in command-line interfaces to display detailed usage information about a command or a program. When you run a command with the `--help` option, it will print out information such as a brief description of what the command does, a list of available options and their meanings, and examples of how to use the command. This flag helps users understand how to properly utilize a command or tool, making it a useful resource for new users or those needing a quick refresher.'
        ip-addr: '[AI] The `w` command with the option `--ip-addr` is used to display detailed information about the users who are currently logged into a Unix or Linux system, along with their IP addresses. This can be helpful for administrators to identify remote users accessing the system and troubleshoot network-related issues.'
        no-current: '[AI] The `w --no-current` flag is used in Git, a version control system, to prevent the display of the current branch''s name when running the `git status` command. This can be useful when working on multiple branches concurrently and wanting to focus solely on the state of the files without being distracted by which branch is currently checked out.'
        no-header: '[AI] The `w` command with the option `--no-header` in Unix-like operating systems is used to display textual reports about terminal activity, such as who is using which terminals and for how long. The `--no-header` option instructs `w` not to print the header line, which usually displays the current time and system information. This can be useful if you want to parse the output of `w` programmatically without the header getting in the way.'
        old-style: '[AI] The `--old-style` flag is a command line option used in some Unix-like tools, particularly those related to version control or text processing. This flag modifies the output format to display it in a compatible way with older versions of the software. For instance, in Git, this option can be used to show commit messages and other outputs similar to how they were displayed in earlier versions of Git. It''s important to note that using `--old-style` might result in less user-friendly output compared to modern styles.'
        short: '[AI] The `w --short` option is a command-line argument used with the `awk` or `grep` utilities in Unix-like operating systems. It modifies the output format to display only essential information in a compact way. Specifically, when used with `awk`, it shortens the output of the `AWK` table (`w`) command by providing a summary of the average, total, and current system statistics, such as CPU usage and memory consumption. In contrast, when used with `grep`, the `--short` option displays only the names of files that match the search pattern without displaying their contents.'
        version: '[AI] The `w --version` command is used in Unix-based systems to check the version information of the `wc` (short for "word count") utility. When you run this command in a terminal, it will display output showing the version number and other relevant information about `wc`, such as its compilation date and the name of the operating system on which it was built.'
