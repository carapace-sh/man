documentation:
    command: '[AI] "Elvish" is not a command but rather a term used in J.R.R. Tolkien''s legendarium for two distinct languages spoken by Elves: Quenya and Sindarin. They are fictional, constructed languages, with complex grammar, phonology, and mythological associations within Tolkien''s universe. There are no actual commands or programs named "elvish" in computing or technology.'
    flag:
        buildinfo: '[AI] The `elvish --buildinfo` flag is used to display detailed build information about Elvish, an interactive and configurable shell. When you run Elvish with this flag, it will output various details about the current build, such as the version number, compiler used, compilation date, and any custom flags or options that were passed during the build process. This information can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues with Elvish or for verifying that you have the correct version of the shell installed.'
        c: |-
            [AI] The `-c` flag in Elvish, a versatile and feature-rich interactive shell, stands for "script mode." When this option is used, Elvish behaves as if it's running inside a script file, with the following differences:

            1. Elvish does not read or execute any startup files.
            2. It does not enter interactive mode by default and instead executes the given commands directly.
            3. If no command is provided, it exits without performing any other actions.
            4. It ignores user input and keyboard events, making it suitable for running scripts in the background or as a daemon process.
        compileonly: '[AI] The `--compileonly` flag in Elvish, a hackable interactive shell, is used to only compile and execute the scripts or files that are specified as arguments, without entering an interactive REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) session after compilation. This is useful when you want to perform batch processing of scripts or automate tasks using Elvish, without manually interacting with it afterwards.'
        daemon: '[AI] The term "Elvish daemon flag" does not exist in the context of computer science or programming, as there is no widely-used programming language or operating system called "Elvish" with such a flag. It seems to be a concept from J.R.R. Tolkien''s mythology where "daemon" refers to a supernatural being and "Elvish" is the language of the Elves in his Middle-earth legendarium. If you meant to ask about a specific implementation or usage of this term, please provide more context.'
        db: '[AI] The `-db` flag in Elvish is used to start Elvish in debug mode. When Elvish is run with this flag, it will print more detailed output about its internal workings and can be helpful for troubleshooting or understanding the underlying mechanics of the shell. Additionally, it may allow users to inspect and modify internal data structures and variables, which can be useful for advanced users and developers.'
        deprecation-level: |-
            [AI] The `--elvish-deprecation-level` flag in Elvish, a configurable and extensible REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for Haskell, is used to control the severity of deprecation warnings that are displayed. Elvish has three levels of deprecation:

            1. `error`: Warnings are reported as errors, causing evaluation to halt. This is useful when developing libraries or working in a production environment where every warning could potentially indicate a serious issue.
            2. `warning`: Warnings are reported as warnings but do not cause evaluation to halt. This is the default level and is suitable for most development use cases, as it alerts you to potential issues while still allowing evaluation to continue.
            3. `none`: No deprecation warnings are shown at all. This may be useful in certain environments where silent execution is desired, but it is generally discouraged as it can lead to unintended consequences or the perpetuation of outdated code.
        help: '[AI] The `--help` flag in Elvish is used to display detailed help information about a specific Elvish command or configuration file. When you run Elvish with the `--help` option followed by the name of a command or a config file, it will print out a description of what that command or config does, along with any available options and their meanings. It''s a convenient way to quickly learn about the functionality of various components in Elvish.'
        i: '[AI] The `-i` flag in Elvish, a terminal-based interactive shell and configuration management system, stands for "interactive." When used with Elvish commands or scripts, it indicates that the command should be run in an interactive mode. Interactive mode allows users to interactively input and modify commands as they are being executed, making it suitable for tasks where you need more control over the running process. It''s essential to note that this flag doesn''t create a new Elvish session but rather modifies the current one.'
        json: '[AI] The `--elfish-json` flag is a command-line option for certain tools, particularly those related to Elf files and the Linux operating system. It specifies that output should be formatted in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a lightweight data interchange format with a simple text-based syntax. This allows for easy parsing and processing of data by various applications, especially those written in programming languages such as JavaScript.'
        log: '[AI] The term "Elvish -log" is not a recognized or standard concept in computing or programming, as it doesn''t correspond to any specific flag or command in Elvish or any other known logging systems. If you meant to refer to a logging feature or configuration option in Elvish (a functional programming language), please provide more context or consult the official documentation for accurate information.'
        lsp: |-
            [AI] `elvish -lsp` is a command-line option for Elvish, an interactive and customizable shell for Unix-like operating systems. The `-lsp` stands for "load file on startup, load plugins, and run script in the given file."

            When you use `elvish -lsp <filename>`, Elvish will:
            1. Load the specified file as your init file, where you can define custom configurations and keybindings.
            2. Automatically load any plugins (Elvish extensions) that are required by the init file or that you have installed.
            3. Execute any script present in the init file upon starting Elvish.

            This option is useful for setting up a personalized Elvish environment, where all customizations and plugins are loaded automatically when starting the shell.
        norc: '[AI] The `--no-rc` flag in Elvish, a terminal-based REPL and interactive shell, disables the loading of init files (also known as rc files) when starting the shell. This means that Elvish will not read or execute any initialization scripts specified in the `$ELVISHRC` environment variable or in the default location (usually `~/.config/elvish/init.elv`). By using this flag, you can start an Elvish session with a clean slate and no predefined configurations or bindings.'
        rc: |-
            [AI] The `-rc` flag in Elvish, a functional and declarative shell programming language, stands for "run command." It is used to execute a command in the current Elvish session or script. When you prepend this flag with a hyphen (`-`), it tells Elvish not to print the normal output of the command, but instead treat its exit status as the result of the command. This can be useful for writing conditional statements or functions based on the success or failure of other commands. For example:

            ```elvish
            % :if (- cmd "ls" -rc) {"Directory is not empty."} {"Directory is empty."}
            ```

            This code snippet checks if the 'ls' command returns a zero exit status (indicating a successful execution and non-empty directory), or any other status (empty directory or failure).
        sock: '[AI] The term "elvish -sock" is not a recognized concept or flag in any standard context, including programming or networking. It appears to be a misinterpretation of two unrelated concepts: Elvish, an ancient Quenya and Sindarin language created by J.R.R. Tolkien, and a Unix socket, a type of interprocess communication mechanism. Therefore, there''s no meaningful explanation for this flag.'
        version: '[AI] The `--elvish-version` flag is a command-line option used in some Unix-like text editors, such as Vi or Vim, to display or set the version of Elvish mode, an extension for these editors that provides additional features and improvements. This option can be invoked with the `:VersionElvish` command within the editor or by passing it as an argument when starting the editor, like so: `vim --startup=vbam --elvish-version`. The output will typically include information about the Elvish mode version number and other relevant details.'
