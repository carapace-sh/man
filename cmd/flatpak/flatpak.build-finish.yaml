    command: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager system to signal that the building and installation of a Flatpak application bundle have been completed successfully. It marks the last step of the Flatpak build process, which starts with `flatpak-build-system` or other methods for preparing and compiling the source code, followed by `flatpak build` to create the application bundle, and finally ends with `flatpak build-finish` to commit the metadata and make it available in the Flatpak repository. This command is important as it enables other processes like signing and distribution of the bundle to occur.'
    flag:
        add-policy: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finalize the build process of an application bundle. The `--add-policy` option that can be passed to this command allows defining custom policies for the newly built application, which can include access control rules, environment variables, and other settings. These policies determine the level of privileges and capabilities granted to the application when it is installed and run on a system.'
        allow: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finalize and prepare a Flatpak bundle for distribution. The `--allow` option grants specific permissions to the finished bundle, allowing it to access certain system resources or perform certain actions that would be otherwise restricted in a contained environment. These permissions are defined in the bundle''s `metadata.xml` file. Using this command will apply the granted permissions to the finished Flatpak bundle.'
        command: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finalize the build process of an application bundle. The `--command` option allows specifying a custom command that will be run inside the container during the build finish stage. This can be useful for performing additional tasks such as installing dependencies, running tests, or generating documentation. The command is executed in a new shell instance with access to the package filesystem and environment variables set by Flatpak.'
        device: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish --device` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system. This command is run after the build process to finalize the creation of a new Flatpak application bundle. The `--device` option specifies that the build should be performed on a specific device or machine, instead of building locally and then transferring the resulting bundle. The command fetches the necessary sources, builds the application using the given environment (e.g., toolchain), and finally generates the finished Flatpak application package, which can be installed on other systems using the Flatpak runtime.'
        disallow: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command-line utility used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finish building and preparing a new app bundle for distribution. The `--disallow` option passed to this command disables the automatic allowing of running the newly built app bundle on the local system. Instead, the user will need to manually allow the app to run after the build process has finished. This can be useful for security reasons, as it allows an administrator or power user to explicitly approve the installation and execution of a new app.'
        env: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finish building and preparing a new app bundle. The `--env` option sets environment variables for the build process, which can be useful for setting up custom builds or compiling software with specific dependencies or configurations. For example, you might use `--env="MYVAR=value"`, or set multiple variables with `--env="KEY1=VALUE1 --env="KEY2=VALUE2"`. These variables will then be available during the build process for the application being packaged.'
        env-fd: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finalize the building process of an application bundle. The option `--env-fd` (file descriptor) specifies that the environment variables to be set for the running application should be read from a file descriptor instead of a regular file. This can be useful in automated build systems where setting up complex environments is necessary, and the environment variables cannot be easily stored in files.'
        extension: '[AI] The `flatpak build-finish --extension` command is used to finalize the building process of an application or extension package using Flatpak, a popular application packaging and deployment system. This command specifically finishes the extension build process by generating the metadata files for the extension package. These metadata files include important information like the extension''s name, description, icon, dependencies, and entry points, which are needed for the extension to be properly installed and function within the hosting platform. In summary, this command prepares an extension package for distribution and installation via Flatpak.'
        extension-priority: |-
            [AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finish building and installing a new app bundle. The `--extension-priority` option affects the priority of the extension bundles within that app.

            When multiple extensions from different apps try to provide functionality for the same host application, the one with a higher priority will be chosen. By default, extensions have a neutral priority (0). However, you can use `--extension-priority` to set a custom priority value (-1, 0, or positive integer) when building an extension bundle. A higher positive number means a higher priority and thus a greater chance of being selected for a host application over other extensions with lower priority values.
        extra-data: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a Flatpak command used to finalize the construction of a new application bundle. The `--extra-data` option allows you to provide additional data files that will be included in the resulting Flatpak package. These extra data files can include things like config files, icons, or any other non-code assets needed by your application. The `build-finish` command compresses and adds these files to the final bundle before it''s ready for distribution and installation via the Flatpak runtime.'
        filesystem: '[AI] The `flatpak build-finish` command is a utility in Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. It''s used to finalize the creation of a new Flatpak app bundle. The `--filesystem` option that follows it specifies how to handle files and directories that are mounted or exported during the build process. With this flag, the filesystem changes made during the build process will be recorded as part of the application''s runtime filesystem. This means that these files will be available when the app is installed and run on other systems. Essentially, it ensures that any necessary files are packaged with the app for proper functionality.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command-line utility in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. It is used to finish the building process of a Flatpak application bundle. When you run `flatpak build-finish --help`, it displays help information about this command. Here's a concise summary:

            `flatpak build-finish [OPTIONS] [PACKAGE]...`

            This command finishes the building process for the given Flatpak packages, which may include installing dependencies, running tests, and creating metadata files. Options can be used to specify additional behavior, like `--no-tests` to skip test runs or `--verbose` for more detailed output.
        help-all: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command-line utility in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. The `--help-all` option is used to display help information for all subcommands and their respective options. In other words, it shows a comprehensive list of all available commands and their usage instructions within the `flatpak build-finish` tool.'
        metadata: '[AI] The `flatpak build-finish --metadata` command is used in the Flatpak application packaging system to generate and update metadata files for a Flatpak application after the building process. This command generates or updates the application''s manifest file (`.desktop`, `.icon`, and `.json` files) and other essential metadata that describes the application, its dependencies, and runtime requirements. The generated metadata is essential for Flatpak to properly install, manage, and run the application on various distributions and platforms.'
        no-exports: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command-line utility in the Flatpak application packaging system used to finish building a Flatpak application bundle. The `--no-exports` option instructs the tool not to generate exported modules as part of the build process. Exported modules are shared libraries or other components that can be used by multiple applications, making them available for other developers to reuse. Without this option, Flatpak would include these exports in the final bundle, increasing its size and potential complexity. With `--no-exports`, only the application''s code and dependencies are packaged.'
        no-inherit-permissions: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finish building an app bundle and prepare it for distribution. The option `--no-inherit-permissions` disables the inheritance of permissions from parent containers during the creation of the new app container. This means that each app will have its own distinct set of permissions, enhancing security by limiting the potential impact of a compromise in one app on others.'
        no-talk-name: |-
            [AI] The `flatpak build-finish` command is a part of the Flatpak application packaging system. It's used to finish building a Flatpak application bundle, which includes installing dependencies and creating metadata files for the application.

            The `--no-talk-name` option is passed as an argument to prevent the command from setting the "Display Name" (also known as "Talk name") during the build process. The Display Name is the human-readable name of the application that is visible in the desktop interface, while the Application ID is a unique identifier for the application within the Flatpak system. By default, `flatpak build-finish` sets both the Application ID and the Display Name during the build process. However, with `--no-talk-name`, only the Application ID will be set, allowing the user to manually specify or override the Display Name later.
        nodevice: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish --nodevice` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system. It completes the final stage of building a new Flatpak application package, without generating any device or machine-specific packages. Instead, it produces universal and remote packages that can be distributed through various channels for installation on different systems. This command does not involve creating device-specific packages, which are only required when developing applications specifically for certain hardware devices.'
        nofilesystem: '[AI] The `flatpak build-finish` command is used to finish building a Flatpak application package after the source code has been compiled. The `--nofilesystem` option instructs the tool not to record or manage any filesystem data in the resulting Flatpak runtime. This means that the packaged app will not have access to any specific files or directories beyond what is necessary for its execution, enhancing security and isolation.'
        nosocket: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux. This command finalizes a Flatpak build by creating metadata files like the app sums file and AppStream metadata. The `--nosocket` flag disables the use of Unix domain sockets for communicating between build processes and the Flatpak builder daemon. It is useful when running the command in an environment where Unix domain sockets are not available or are restricted.'
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command-line utility in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux desktops. The `--ostree-verbose` option is used with this command to provide detailed output about the OSTree (an immutable-updating file system) build and commit process during the finishing of a new Flatpak build. This verbose mode displays information about each step, including the creation of a new OSTree branch, committing changes, and pushing the new branch to a remote repository if configured.'
        own-name: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command-line tool in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux desktops. The command `--own-name` is an option used with this tool to specify the own name of the application being packaged. An own name uniquely identifies an application across all distributions and repositories within the Flatpak ecosystem. This helps ensure that there are no naming conflicts when distributing or installing applications. The full command `flatpak build-finish --own-name <your-application-name>` sets this own name for the packaged application during its final stages of creation.'
        persist: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finalize the build of an application bundle. The `--persist` option tells the command to persist the generated metadata and artifacts, making them available for later use in creating new builds or publishing the package to a Flatpak repository. In essence, it saves the build results permanently, allowing easy access for other processes or users without having to rebuild the application every time.'
        remove-extension: '[AI] The `flatpak build-finish --remove-extension` command is used in the Flatpak application packaging system to remove any installed extensions after a successful build process. This command ensures that only the base application without any additional extensions is packaged and distributed, allowing for fine-grained control over what is included in the final Flatpak application bundle.'
        remove-policy: '[AI] The `flatpak build-finish --remove-policy` command is used in the Flatpak application packaging system to remove a specific policy file from a built Flatpak bundle. Policies define the runtime permissions and configuration for the application, including access to system resources and capabilities. Removing a policy file allows the application to run without that specific policy restriction when installed on a system.'
        require-version: |-
            [AI] The `flatpak build-finish --require-version` command is used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finalize a Flatpak build process and set the required version for the resulting application bundle.

            When creating a new Flatpak application, developers use the `flatpak-buildsystem` or other tools to create a container that includes the application code, runtime dependencies, and metadata. After building this container into an image, the `flatpak build-finish` command is run to finalize the image and create a distributable Flatpak bundle.

            The `--require-version` option specifies the version number that should be assigned to the resulting Flatpak application bundle. This can be useful for managing dependencies, as it ensures that users installing the application will get a specific version of the software. If this option is not provided, the current Git branch or commit hash may be used instead as the version number.

            For example: `flatpak build-finish --require-version=1.0.0 myapp.build` would create a Flatpak bundle named "myapp" with version number 1.0.0.
        runtime: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish --runtime` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system. It finishes the building process of an application bundle and sets up its dependencies, called runtimes, which are collections of libraries and other components that are shared between multiple applications. The `--runtime` option specifies which runtime to use for this application bundle. This command prepares the bundle for distribution and installation on various Linux systems using Flatpak.'
        sdk: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a popular application packaging system. The `--sdk` option specifies the software development kit (SDK) to use during the build process of a Flatpak application. In simpler terms, it sets the environment and tools needed for compiling the source code into an executable package that can run in a Flatpak container. Once built with the `flatpak-build-setup` command, `flatpak build-finish --sdk` finalizes the build process by generating metadata files required for distribution and publishing of the finished Flatpak application to various repositories.'
        share: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish --share` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system. It completes the building process of an application bundle and makes it ready for sharing with other systems or users. The `--share` option enables the created bundle to be published on a remote repository for distribution, allowing others to install the application easily using Flatpak.'
        socket: |-
            [AI] The `flatpak build-finish --socket` command is used in the Flatpak application packaging system to establish a socket connection between a running application and its builder or development environment.

            When developing or building a Flatpak application, the `--socket` option creates an inter-process communication (IPC) socket that can be used for communication between the builder and the application. This is particularly useful during testing and debugging phases, allowing the developer to interact with the application as if it were running in its normal environment.

            Once the build process is finished, the `build-finish` command is run to finalize the build, including the creation of the application bundle and the registration of the Flatpak application package. The `--socket` option passed to this command ensures that the connection to the socket created during the build process is maintained or re-established for further interaction with the application.

            In summary, using `flatpak build-finish --socket` during the application development and build process allows for seamless interaction between the developer/builder and the Flatpak application under test while maintaining a socket connection to facilitate communication and debugging.
        system-no-talk-name: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in Flatpak, a software packaging system for Linux, to finish building an application bundle. The `--system` flag indicates that the build process should be run as the system user, granting it system privileges. `no-talk-name` is an option under this flag which prevents the creation of a desktop entry with a localized name in the system''s language settings. Instead, it uses the default (English) name provided by the application bundle.'
        system-own-name: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finish building an application bundle. The `--system-own-name` option sets the system-wide own name for the application, meaning it will be installed under this name when run with elevated privileges (i.e., as a system package). This can help ensure consistent and unambiguous naming of applications across systems.'
        system-talk-name: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finish building an application bundle. The `--system` option indicates that the bundle will be installed for all users on the system, not just the user who built it. `talk-name` is a metadata key used to specify the human-readable name of the application as it will appear in the system''s software manager and other interfaces. The entire command, `flatpak build-finish --system <bundle_directory> --system-talk-name "<application_name>"`, sets the system-wide talk-name for the application during bundle finishing.'
        talk-name: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command-line tool used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finish building an application bundle. The `--talk-name` option is for specifying a name or label for the resulting built bundle''s application identifier (appID). This appID is used by the Flatpak runtime to uniquely identify and manage installed applications.'
        unset-env: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finalize a built application bundle. The `--unset-env` option is used to remove specific environment variables set during the build process before finishing the build. By doing so, the finished application will not inherit those variables when run in its intended execution environment.'
        unshare: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finalize the build of an application bundle. The `--unshare` option passed with this command detaches and sets up a new init system for the created container, making it independent from the host system. This allows the packaged application to run in a more isolated environment.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak build-finish` is a command-line utility used in the Flatpak application packaging system to finish the build process of an application bundle. The `--verbose` option increases the output of information during the build process, providing more detailed progress reports and error messages if any issues arise. This allows developers to better understand what is happening during the build process and troubleshoot any potential problems.'
