documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint runner profile set` command is used to configure the settings for a Waypoint Runner, which is a tool used in Kubernetes for managing and executing jobs defined by Kubernetes YAML files called "ways." Profiles define different ways of running these jobs, including resource requirements, concurrency limits, and other parameters. This command allows you to create or update a specific profile by providing its name and the desired settings as arguments.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `waypoint runner profile set --app` command is used with Kubernetes Waypoint, an open-source continuous delivery and deployment tool for Kubernetes applications. This command sets the application (app) configuration in a Waypoint runner profile. A runner profile defines the environment and resources needed to build and deploy an app. By specifying `--app`, you''re indicating that the following configuration will apply only to the specified app within that runner profile.'
        default: '[AI] The command `waypoint runner profile set --default` is used to configure the default running profile in Waypoint, an open-source Kubernetes application delivery platform. This command sets the designated profile as the one that will be used by default when deploying applications via Waypoint. By using this command with no argument, it sets the currently active profile as the default. If a different profile name is provided, then that specific profile becomes the new default.'
        env-vars: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint runner profile set --env-vars` command in Kubernetes is used to configure and manage environment variables for a specific Kubernetes job or pod running under Waypoint, an open-source GitOps framework.

            In simpler terms, this command sets or updates the environment variables for a particular Waypoint runner profile, which can then be applied to jobs or pods during their deployment process. This allows users to easily manage and inject dynamic environment variables into their applications without having to modify the application code directly.
        name: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint run` command in Kubernetes is used to execute a container image against a set of YAML files or HELM charts, which are collectively referred to as a "mission" or "workload". The `--profile-set` flag is an optional argument for `waypoint run`.

            The `--name` flag within the `--profile-set` argument specifies the name of a particular profile set within a Waypoint organization. A profile set is a collection of configuration profiles that define various aspects of the application, such as environment variables, container image tags, or resource limits. By using a specific profile set name with `waypoint run`, you can apply the associated configurations to your workload during execution.
        oci-url: '[AI] The `waypoint runner profile set --oci-url` command in Docker Tilt (a Kubernetes development tool) sets the Container Registry (OCI) URL for a Waypoint Runner profile. A Waypoint Runner is a Kubernetes custom resource that allows running and managing applications as if they were services in a Kubernetes cluster, but with additional features like automatic retries and blue-green deployments. The `--oci-url` option specifies the URL of the OCI registry where the container images for the application are stored.'
        plain: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint runner profile set --plain` command is used in the OpenStreetMap (OSM) editing software, iD Editor, to apply a specific editing profile for waypoints. A profile is a set of rules and configurations that can be applied to streamline certain editing tasks.

            When using this command with the `--plain` option, it sets the waypoint runner profile without displaying any additional information or confirmation messages. This command assumes that you have already loaded or created the desired waypoint runner profile within iD Editor. It simply applies the rules and configurations of the selected profile to your current editing session.
        plugin-config: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint runner profile set --plugin-config` command is used in Kubernetes to configure the behavior of a specific Waypoint Runner profile. Waypoint Runners are extensions that enable Waypoint, an open-source GitOps framework, to manage and deploy applications on various platforms like Kubernetes, AWS ECS, etc.

            The `--plugin-config` option allows you to pass configuration data specifically for the plugin being used with the Runner profile. By providing a JSON or YAML file containing the desired configurations, you can customize the runner's behavior according to your requirements. For example, you may want to set environment variables, modify build and deployment strategies, or configure access credentials for a specific platform.

            In summary, `waypoint runner profile set --plugin-config` helps you tailor a Waypoint Runner profile to better suit your application's needs by providing fine-grained configuration options for the underlying plugin.
        plugin-type: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint runner profile set --plugin-type"` is used in Kubernetes to configure a Waypoint Runner with a specific plugin type. Waypoint Runners are custom executors that can be used to extend the capabilities of Kubernetes applications beyond what''s provided by default. The plugin type specifies which kind of runner will be used, such as `docker`, `knative`, or `custom`. This flag sets the profile for the specified Waypoint Runner with the given plugin type.'
        project: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint runner profile set --project` command is used in Google Cloud's Kubernetes engine, Waypoint, to configure a specific Kubernetes cluster profile for a given project.

            This command sets the active Waypoint runner profile for a specified Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, allowing you to manage and deploy applications using that project's resources and configurations. Provide the project ID as an argument to the command. For example: `waypoint runner profile set --project=my-gcp-project`.
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint runner profile set --workspace` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source continuous delivery and deployment platform for Kubernetes. This command sets a specific Waypoint profile based on the given workspace name. Profiles define how applications are built, configured, and deployed. By specifying a workspace, you''re configuring Waypoint to use the corresponding set of profiles for managing your applications within that context.'
