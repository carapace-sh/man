documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pamac install` is a command used in Arch Linux and its derivatives to install software packages using the Pacman package manager with the Parallel Advanced Multi-threadedArchive Cache (PAMAC) wrapper. It provides an interface for managing repositories, updating the system''s package database, and installing or removing packages, all in parallel if desired, thus improving efficiency.'
    flag:
        as-deps: '[AI] `pamac install --as-deps` is a command used in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. This command is used to install only the dependencies of a specified package, without installing the package itself. The `--as-deps` flag instructs Pamac to treat the specified packages as if they were dependencies of another package being installed, thereby installing only the dependencies and not the packages themselves.'
        as-explicit: '[AI] `pamac install --as-explicit` is a command used in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux. The `--as-explicit` flag modifies the installation process to only install explicitly listed packages and their dependencies, ignoring any conflicting or optional dependencies that may be suggested. This allows for more precise control over which packages are installed, reducing potential conflicts or unnecessary installations.'
        download-only: '[AI] `pamac install --download-only` is a command used in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux. This option instructs Pacman to download only the specified package files without installing them. The packages are saved in the local cache directory for later use or manual installation with other tools. This can be useful when you have slow or unreliable internet connection, or if you want to save bandwidth by downloading packages offline.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `pamac install --dry-run` is a command used in the Pacman Package Manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. The `--dry-run` option causes Pamac to simulate the installation of specified packages without actually installing them. This allows users to see what packages would be installed, their dependencies, and any potential conflicts before executing the command for real. This can help in planning and minimizing potential issues with the system.'
        ignore: '[AI] `pamac install --ignore` is a command used in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. This command allows you to install a package while ignoring specific warnings or conflicts that may arise during the installation process. The `--ignore` option takes an argument, which is a regular expression pattern, allowing you to filter the warnings or conflicts to be ignored based on their messages. For example, `pamac install package-name --ignore=''conflicts|depends''` would ignore any installation warnings related to conflicts or dependencies issues. Keep in mind that ignoring warnings can potentially lead to unintended consequences and instability in your system if the warnings indicate actual issues that need addressing.'
        no-confirm: '[AI] `pamac install --no-confirm` is a command used in Pacman-based Linux distributions, such as Arch Linux and Manjaro. It installs a specified package without prompting for user confirmation during the installation process. The `--no-confirm` flag ensures that all necessary dependencies are installed automatically, and the installation proceeds uninterrupted. This command is often used in scripts or automated tasks where human interaction is not desired or feasible.'
        no-upgrade: '[AI] `pamac install --no-upgrade` is a command used in Arch Linux to install a specific package without checking for or installing any upgrades to existing packages. The `--no-upgrade` flag instructs the Pacman package manager, which is used by Pamac, to skip the upgrade step during the installation process. This can be useful when you want to install a new package but don''t want to update any other packages at the same time.'
        overwrite: '[AI] `pamac install --overwrite` is a command used in Pacman, the package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. The `--overwrite` flag allows forceful installation or upgrade of packages, even if it means replacing files that were manually modified or are conflicting with other packages. This command can potentially cause data loss or system instability if used carelessly, but it''s useful when you want to ensure that a specific package is installed over others or if there are conflicts that need resolution.'
        upgrade: '[AI] `pamac install --upgrade` is a command used in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. It instructs Pamac to perform an upgrade of all installed packages that have new versions available in the repositories, as well as install any new packages that depend on them. In other words, it updates the entire system, ensuring that all components are up-to-date with the latest security patches and improvements.'
