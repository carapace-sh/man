    command: '[AI] `gh issue transfer` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to transfer ownership of a GitHub Issue from one repository or user to another. This command requires authentication and the necessary permissions to modify issues. It takes the source repository or username, issue number, and target repository or username as arguments in the following format: `gh issue transfer <source_repo|username> <issue_number> <target_repo|username>`. For example, `gh issue transfer myoldrepo 123 mynewrepo` would transfer issue #123 from `myoldrepo` to `mynewrepo`.'
