        [AI] `wezterm serial` is not a valid WezTerm command as such. WezTerm is a terminal emulator for Unix and Windows with advanced features, including tabbed scrollback, powerful customization, and efficient use of resources. The term "serial" refers to communication between devices through a serial interface, which is typically used for connecting hardware devices like modems or sensors.

        If you meant to ask about using WezTerm as a serial terminal emulator, it doesn't natively support serial connections out of the box. However, you can use it with additional tools such as `minicom`, ` screen`, or `PuTTY` to establish and manage a serial connection to a device. Once connected, you can then open WezTerm to access the terminal session over that connection.
    flag:
        baud: '[AI] `wezterm serial --baud` is a command-line option for WezTerm, a terminal emulator. It sets up a serial connection between WezTerm and an external device using the specified baud rate (bits per second). For example, `--baud 9600` sets the connection speed to 9600 baud. This is useful for interacting with hardware devices such as routers or embedded systems.'
        class: '[AI] `wezterm serial --class` is a command-line argument for WezTerm, a terminal emulator that supports Unicode and advanced features. The `serial` part specifies that this instance of WezTerm should be used to connect to a serial device or remote server via a serial protocol like SSH. The `--class` flag sets the custom window class name for the terminal window in the operating system''s task manager or other tools, allowing users to easily identify and manage multiple terminal windows if needed.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `wezterm serial --help` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for Unix and Windows with advanced features and a modern, fast implementation. The `serial` part of this command refers to WezTerm's support for serial connections, allowing you to connect to devices such as routers, printers, or embedded systems using serial protocols like FTDI, RS232, etc.

            The `--help` flag is a standard option in many Unix-based commands and tools, displaying detailed usage information about the command and its available options. In this case, running `wezterm serial --help` will provide you with information on how to use WezTerm for serial connections, including any required arguments or flags, examples, and additional details on each option.
        position: '[AI] The `--position` flag in the `wezterm serial` command is used to specify the terminal window position on the screen. It takes an argument in the format of x,y coordinates where (0,0) represents the top-left corner of the screen. By default, WezTerm opens in the center of the screen. For example, `--position 100,50` would open the terminal window 100 pixels from the left and 50 pixels from the bottom edge of the screen.'
