description: Print dagger version
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `dagger version` command is used in Dagger, a build tool for Java and Android projects, to check or set the version of Dagger being used in the project. When run without any arguments, it prints out the currently applied Dagger version. However, you can also use it with an argument to specify a new version number to apply. For example: `dagger version 2.31`. This command updates the Dagger dependencies in your project''s build files to use the specified version.'
