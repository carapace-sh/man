    command: '[AI] `vagrant plugin expunge` is a Vagrant command used to remove all installed plugins from the local Vagrant installation. It helps in starting with a clean slate by completely removing any unwanted or previously used plugins, allowing you to install fresh ones as needed.'

        force: '[AI] `vagrant plugin expunge --force` is a Vagrant command used to remove and delete all installed plugins from the local Vagrant installation. The `--force` option ensures that any plugins data or configurations are permanently deleted without asking for confirmation. This command can be useful when starting from a clean slate, such as before upgrading Vagrant or before using a new machine with no existing Vagrant configuration.'
        global-only: '[AI] The `vagrant plugin expunge --global-only` command is used to remove (uninstall) Vagrant plugins installed globally in your system, without affecting any plugins that are specific to individual Vagrant projects. This command is particularly useful when you want to completely uninstall a plugin and free up disk space or when dealing with conflicts between different plugins.'
        local: '[AI] The `vagrant plugin expunge --local` command is used to uninstall local Vagrant plugins. The `--local` option specifies that only locally installed plugins, and not those managed by Vagrant''s built-in plugin repository, should be removed. This command can be useful when you want to completely remove a plugin from your local Vagrant installation without leaving any traces in the default plugin directory. It does not affect plugins installed globally or managed through other means.'
        local-only: '[AI] The `vagrant plugin expunge --local-only` command is used to remove all locally installed Vagrant plugins while keeping the globally installed ones. The `--local-only` option specifies that only plugins installed on the local machine should be removed. This command can be useful when you want to start with a clean slate and reinstall plugins one by one for troubleshooting or testing purposes.'
        reinstall: '[AI] The `vagrant plugin expunge --reinstall` command is used to remove and then reinstall all plugins in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This can be helpful when experiencing issues with Vagrant''s plugin functionality, as it forces a fresh installation of each plugin. It''s important to note that this command will delete the configuration files and settings for each plugin, so any customizations must be reapplied after running this command.'
