documentation:
    command: '[AI] `xdotool keyup` is a command-line tool for interacting with the X window system using the xdotool library. The `keyup` subcommand is used to simulate the release of a key or keys in an X11 environment. By sending a "key up" event, you can mimic releasing a key after pressing it down, which might be useful in automated testing or scripting scenarios where you want to simulate keyboard input and ensure accurate timing between keystrokes.'
    flag:
        clearmodifiers: '[AI] `xdotool keyup --clearmodifiers` is a command used in the xdotool tool for interacting with a graphical interface from the terminal in Linux or Unix-like systems. This specific command sends a "keyup" event to the focused window without modifiers, effectively releasing any currently pressed keys. By including `--clearmodifiers`, it ensures that no modifier keys (such as Shift, Ctrl, or Alt) are included in the key release event.'
        delay: '[AI] `xdotool keyup --delay` is a command from the xdotool utility, which is used to automate interactions with the X Window System graphical environment. The `keyup` action simulates a key release event, and the `--delay` option introduces a delay in milliseconds between key events. So, `xdotool keyup --delay <milliseconds>` releases the previously pressed key after the specified delay before releasing the next key or sequence of keys.'
        window: '[AI] `xdotool` is a versatile tool for interacting with X11 windows using the command line. The `keyup` action is used to simulate a keyboard key release event. The `--window` option specifies which window to target with this action by providing its ID or title. For example, `xdotool keyup --window "Google Chrome" <key>` releases the specified key in the Google Chrome window.'
