documentation:
    command: '[AI] "charm serve" is a command used in Charms, a modeling format for cloud applications and services, to start serving a Charm locally during development or testing. It spins up local containers for the Charm''s dependencies and the application itself, then makes the application available on a specific port. This allows developers to test their Charms without deploying them to a production environment.'
    flag:
        data-dir: '[AI] `char-rst` is a popular Git tool for managing and syncing charms, which are Ansible configurations for deploying and managing applications on Juju, a service orchestration platform. The command `charms serve --data-dir <path>` sets up a local Charm Helm repository, serving charms to other machines using the given path as the data directory. This allows for easy sharing of custom charms within your team or organization.'
        health-port: '[AI] `charm serve --health-port` is a command used in Juju, a service orchestration tool, to run and expose a Charm (a Juju application package) locally for testing or development purposes. The `--health-port` option specifies the port number that the charm will use to advertise its health status to Juju''s central controller.'
        http-port: '[AI] The `--http-port` flag in the `charms serve` command is used to specify the port number on which Juju should expose the Charm''s HTTP interface. This flag allows you to customize the default port (usually 80 or 8443) when deploying a Charm with Juju. The Charm will then be accessible via that port using the external IP address of the Juju controller or the specific unit''s public IP if it''s exposed.'
        ssh-port: '[AI] The `--ssh-port` option under `charms serve` in Juju is used to specify a custom SSH port number for the Charm that is being served. By default, the SSH server listens on port 22. However, when using `--ssh-port`, you can define a different port number, which can be helpful in certain situations such as when there are conflicts with other services or for security reasons. The flag modifies the Charm''s configuration to expose the specified SSH port and sets up the appropriate iptables rules.'
        stats-port: '[AI] `charms serve --stats-port` is a command used in Juju, a service orchestration tool. The flag modifies the Charm Helper, which is a background process that runs on a Juju-managed machine. It sets the stats port for the Charm Helper to be publicly accessible, allowing external tools like `juju status` to retrieve real-time metrics and logs of the related application or service.'
