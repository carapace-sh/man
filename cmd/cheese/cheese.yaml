    command: '[AI] The "cheese" command is not a standard computer command, but it is commonly used in photography and particularly in the context of Linux terminal applications like Cheese (gtk-cheese) or gphoto2. It triggers the process of capturing an image using these tools. After executing the command, the camera or the built-in webcam will take a photo once you press the designated button for capturing images.'
    flag:
        device: '[AI] The `--device` flag in TensorFlow''s `cheese` command is used to specify a custom computation device other than the default CPU for executing operations. This flag takes an argument, which can be an ID of a GPU or a file path to a TensorFlow compatible model saved with the saved model format (SavedModel). By providing this flag and argument, TensorFlow knows to use that specific device when running inferences or training models.'
        display: '[AI] The `--display` option in the `cheese` command is used to specify which output format or backend display server to use when running automated GUI tests with the `cheese-gtk-test` tool. It takes an argument, typically the name of a display server such as "Xvfb" or "VNC", and starts that server if it''s not already running before executing the tests. This allows for testing graphical applications in a headless environment without requiring a physical display or login session.'
        fullscreen: '[AI] The `--fullscreen` flag for the `cheese` application in Linux is used to run the Cheese photo booth in full screen mode. When this option is provided, the user interface of Cheese takes up the entire screen, providing a more immersive experience when taking photos or making videos with the built-in webcam.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `--help` option is a common command-line argument used in various Unix-like tools, including the `cheese` application. When you run `cheese --help`, the software will display detailed information about how to use it, including:

            1. A brief description of what the cheese application does.
            2. The name and a short synopsis of each command-line argument or option that can be used with the application.
            3. Detailed explanation of each argument, including its short and long forms, default values if any, and examples of how it can be used.
            4. Additional notes and usage examples.

            The output helps users understand how to effectively use the `cheese` application, allowing them to take advantage of its full functionality.
        help-all: |-
            [AI] The `--help-all` flag for the `cheese` command is not a standard option. It seems to be specific to certain implementations of `cheese`, which is typically a screensaver or a utility for taking screenshots in Linux systems.

            When used, the `--help-all` flag is intended to display comprehensive help information for all available commands and options of the `cheese` application. It provides a detailed explanation of each command's purpose, as well as a list of the possible options with their descriptions. This can be helpful for users who want to familiarize themselves with the full range of features offered by the `cheese` utility.
        help-gapplication: |-
            [AI] The `--help-gapplication` option is not a valid flag for the `cheese` application in Ubuntu or any other major Linux distribution. This flag does not exist, and running `cheese --help-gapplication` will result in an error message indicating that no such option is recognized.

            However, if you meant to ask about the usage of the `cheese` application itself, here's a brief explanation:

            `cheese` is a simple photographic application for taking pictures and making adjustments. It comes pre-installed in many popular Linux distributions. To use it with basic options, simply open a terminal and type "cheese" without any arguments. For more detailed information about its various features and usage, you can run "cheese --help". This command will display the help text with all available options and their explanations.
        help-gtk: '[AI] The `--help-gtk` option is a specific help flag for Cheese, a popular photography application for the GNOME desktop environment. It is designed to be used with GTK+ based graphical user interfaces. When passed to Cheese as an argument (`cheese --help-gtk`), it generates a detailed help output tailored to the GTK+ interface elements and interactions, providing users with comprehensive information on how to utilize the application effectively using its GTK+ UI.'
        version: '[AI] `cheese --version` is a command used with Cheese, a simple graphical application for taking snapshot photos and making small movies from your webcam in Linux systems. The command requests and displays the current version of Cheese that is installed on your system.'
        wide: '[AI] The `--wide` option in the `cheese` command is used to apply a given operation to every element in a list instead of just printing the matching ones. For instance, with the `ls` command integrated into `cheese`, using `cheese ls --width` would list all files and directories in a wide format, filling the terminal window.'
