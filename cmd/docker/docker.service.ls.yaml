documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker service ls` is a command used in Docker Swarm mode to list all currently running and parked services along with their replicas, active tasks, network, and desired state. It provides an overview of how the services are deployed and their current status within the swarm cluster.'
    flag:
        filter: '[AI] `docker service ls --filter` is a command used in Docker Swarm to filter and list the currently running services. The `--filter` option allows you to specify filters based on certain key-value pairs to narrow down the output. For instance, `docker service ls --filter name=<service_name>` will show details only for the specified service or `docker service ls --filter status=created` will list services with created status. Multiple filters can be chained using `--filter` key multiple times.'
        format: '[AI] `docker service ls --format` is a command used with Docker Swarm to list all running services along with custom output formatting. The `--format` option allows specifying a template for the command output, which can include fields such as service name, ID, replicas count, desired state, and created date. This command helps in automating and customizing the way you view and process information about your Docker Swarm services.'
        quiet: '[AI] `docker service ls --quiet` is a command used in Docker Swarm mode to list all running services with minimal output. The `--quiet` flag (also known as `-q`) instructs the command to return only the service names, one per line. This can be useful for automating tasks where only the service names are required.'
