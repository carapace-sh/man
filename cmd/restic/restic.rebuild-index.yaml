description: Build a new index
flags:
    --read-all-packs: read all pack files to generate new index from scratch
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `restic` command `rebuild-index` is used to rebuild the index data structures of a `restic` backup repository. This can be necessary in case of file system changes that were not properly detected by `restic`, or if there are corruption issues with the index files. Running this command will scan the entire repository, update the index with all the current files and directories, and optionally re-encrypt the data for security. It''s important to note that this process can take a considerable amount of time for large backups.'
    flag:
        read-all-packs: '[AI] `restic rebuild-index --read-all-packs` is a command used in the restic backup tool. This command rebuilds the index of all pack files, which are stored packages of data in Git-like repositories used by restic. The `--read-all-packs` option tells restic to read and process all pack files without filtering or skipping any. The result is an updated index that reflects the current state of the repository.'
