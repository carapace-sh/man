    command: '[AI] The `wire show` command in Verilog or SystemVerilog simulation tools is used to display the internal signals and their current values of a given module or design under test (DUT). It provides visualization of the netlist representation, showing the connections between different nets and modules. This information can be helpful during verification and debugging stages, allowing engineers to understand the signal flow and identify potential issues.'
    flag:
        tags: '[AI] The `--wire-show-tags` flag is a command option used in Wire, a data synchronization tool for development teams. This flag enables the display of tags on entities in the local and remote data models while syncing. Tags are user-defined labels that help in organizing, filtering, and tracking changes in the data. By using this flag, developers can easily identify the impact of their changes during a synchronization process.'
