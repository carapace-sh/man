documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nix registry remove` command is used to remove a specific package and its dependencies from the Nix Package Manager cache or store. The syntax is as follows: `nix-env -f <nix-expression> -r <package-name>`. Here, `<nix-expression>` specifies the Nix expression for the registry (e.g., `nixpkgs`), and `<package-name>` refers to the name of the package to be removed. This command does not affect installed packages on your system; it only modifies the Nix expressions and cache.'
    flag:
        debug: |-
            [AI] `nix-registry` is a component of Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The command `nix registry remove --debug` is used to remove a specific package from the Nix Package Registry, with debug mode enabled.

            When you run this command, it sends a request to the Nix Package Server to delete the specified package. The `--debug` flag enables detailed output of the communication between your system and the server, providing more information about what is happening during the removal process. This can be useful for troubleshooting or understanding how the Nix Package Manager works behind the scenes.
        log-format: '[AI] The `nix-registry` is a package manager for Nix, a configuration management system. The command `nix registry remove <package>` is used to remove a specific package from the Nix expression language''s registry, which is a remote repository of packages. The option `--log-format` specifies the format of the output log generated when running this command. The available log formats include "plain", "json" or "table". This option allows users to customize how they want to receive the log information during the removal process.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] `nix-registry` is a component of Nix, a packaging system for Linux and other systems. The command `nix registry remove <package> --print-build-logs` instructs it to remove the specified package from the Nix expression language registry. The `--print-build-logs` option requests that the build logs for the removal be printed to the standard output, providing more information about the build and removal process.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `nix-registry` is a package management system used in NixOS and other Nix distributions. The command `nix registry remove --quiet` is used to remove a specific package or a package version from the local Nix registry without displaying any output or progress messages. This can be useful when running automated scripts, as it helps keep the output clean and focused on other tasks.'
        registry: '[AI] `nix-registry` is a tool in Nix package manager for managing user-defined packages. The command `nix-registry remove --registry <registry-name>` removes a specified Nix registry from your configuration, effectively disabling access to its packages. This can be useful if you want to temporarily or permanently remove a registry due to updates, maintenance, or other reasons.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `nix-registry` is a tool used in the Nix Package Manager for managing and sharing configurations, environments, and user-defined packages. The command `nix registry remove --verbose` removes a specific registry entry with its associated data. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output displayed during the removal process to provide more information about the progress and outcome of the operation.'
