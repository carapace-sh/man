documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker pull` command is used to download an image from a Docker registry. The syntax is `docker pull <image>:<tag or digest>`. For instance, `docker pull ubuntu:latest` would download the latest Ubuntu image from the official Docker Hub registry. This command does not create any containers or run any processes; it simply retrieves the image data to be used at a later time for container creation.'
    flag:
        all-tags: '[AI] The `docker pull --all-tags` command is used to retrieve an image from a Docker registry with all available tags. The `--all-tags` option tells Docker to pull all existing versions or tags of the image, including the latest one by default. It can help ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the image and all its historical revisions for potential use in your local environment.'
        disable-content-trust: '[AI] The `docker pull --disable-content-trust` command is used to download a Docker image from a registry without verifying its content signatures. This means that Docker will not check the authenticity and integrity of the image''s contents during the pull process, bypassing the default security checks. It''s important to note that using this option may expose your system to potential risks if the pulled image is malicious or tampered with. The flag should only be used in trusted environments or when explicitly requiring an unverified image for a specific reason.'
        platform: '[AI] The `docker pull --platform` command is used to pull Docker images with specific platform requirements. It allows you to specify the operating system and architecture of the host machine where you intend to run the image. For example, `docker pull --platform linux/amd64 myimage:latest` pulls the latest version of "myimage" that''s built for the Linux amd64 architecture. This command helps ensure compatibility between the Docker images and the target host machine, preventing potential runtime issues.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `docker pull --quiet` command is used to download an image from a Docker registry without displaying any progress output or messages during the process. It''s useful when you want to automate image pulls in scripts or CI/CD pipelines and don''t need to see the detailed information each step provides. This quiet mode can be achieved by adding the `--quiet` flag before the `pull` command.'
