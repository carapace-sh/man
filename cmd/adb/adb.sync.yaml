name: sync
description: sync a local build from $ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT to the device
flags:
    -Z: disable compression
    -l: list files that would be copied, but don't copy them
    -n: 'dry run: push files to device without storing to the filesystem'
    -z=: enable compression with a specified algorithm (any, none, brotli)
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `adb sync` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) toolset for synchronizing data between an Android device and a computer. Specifically, it transfers files between the device''s internal storage and the local directory on the computer, typically used to backup or restore apps and their data. It supports both one-way (from device to PC or vice versa) and two-way syncing. By default, it syncs all data, but you can specify particular directories using the `<local_dest>` and/or `<remote_src>` options.'
    flag:
        Z: '[AI] The command `adb sync -Z` is used in Android Debug Bridge (adb) to perform a zero-mode sync between a local directory and an Android device. This means that only new or modified files will be synchronized, avoiding unnecessary data transfer and reducing the time taken for large data sets. The `-Z` flag enables this mode.'
        l: '[AI] `adb sync -l` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to list synchronization statistics between an Android device and a local or remote directory. The `-l` option stands for "list," indicating that the output will display detailed information about files that have been synced, including the number of bytes transferred and the elapsed time for each file. The command does not actually perform any file transfer but only shows the synchronization statistics.'
        "n": '[AI] `adb sync -n` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to synchronize data between a device and the local or remote file system. The `-n` option is used to perform a non-recursive sync, meaning it will only transfer files and directories explicitly mentioned, without going into subdirectories. This can be useful when you want to sync specific files or directories while avoiding unnecessary data transfer.'
        z: |-
            [AI] `adb sync -z` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB), a versatile tool for communicating with and managing Android devices. This specific command facilitates data synchronization between the device and the local file system on your development machine.

            The `-z` option is significant here, as it enables zipped syncing. When you use this flag, ADB compresses the transferred files into a single archive before sending them over. As a result, multiple small files are sent in a more efficient way, saving bandwidth and time during the synchronization process. The compressed data will be unzipped automatically to their original format on your local machine upon arrival.
