flags:

documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `glab mr approve` command is used with GitLab''s `glab` tool for local development workflows. This command approves a merge request (MR) locally, which means it simulates the actions of clicking the "Approve" button in the GitLab web interface. By doing this, you are indicating that you have reviewed the changes made in the MR and believe they can be merged into the target branch. Note that the approval only happens locally, and you still need to push your local changes to GitLab for the approval to take effect on the remote repository.'
    flag:
        sha: '[AI] The command `git flag mr approve --sha` is used in Git to apply a label or tag named "approve" to a specific commit, identified by its SHA (Short Hash). This action is typically performed as part of a code review process in GitHub or other version control systems. Applying this label marks the commit as ready for approval from team members or reviewers. It does not change the state of the commit or merge request in any way, it just adds metadata that can be used to filter and manage commits more easily.'
