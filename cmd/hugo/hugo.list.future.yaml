    command: '[AI] The `hugo list future` command is used in Hugo, a popular static site generator, to list all contents marked with the future front matter key. Contents tagged with this key will not be rendered by default in the current build but will become available in future builds as they are published. This command helps to preview and manage future content before making it live.'
