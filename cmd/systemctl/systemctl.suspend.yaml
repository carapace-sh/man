description: Suspend the system
group: system
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl suspend` is a Linux system command used to put the system into suspension (also known as hibernation). When executed, the running system saves its current state to the disk and then enters a low power mode, effectively pausing all activities. Upon resuming with the `systemctl resume` command, the system restores its previous state from the saved image on the disk and continues executing where it left off. This can be useful for saving energy or during system maintenance tasks that don''t require constant user interaction.'
