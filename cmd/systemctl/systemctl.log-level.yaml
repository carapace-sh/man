documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl log-level` is a command used in Linux systems with systemd init system to view or set the logging level of various system services. The logging level determines the severity of messages that get logged, with options such as `emerg`, `alert`, `crit`, `err`, `warning`, `notice`, `info`, and `debug`. To check the current log level, run `sudo systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running | grep -v on-reboot | awk ''{print $1}'' | xargs systemctl status | grep ''^ Jul'' | awk ''{print $3}'' | uniq | xargs systemctl is-enabled --quiet | grep '': enabled'' | awk ''{print $1}'' | xargs systemctl --quiet is-loglevel | awk ''{print $4, $2}''`. To set the log level for a specific service, use `sudo systemctl [set-]log-level <service> <level>`, where `<service>` is the name of the service and `<level>` is the desired logging level.'
