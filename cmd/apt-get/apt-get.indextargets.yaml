documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `apt-get` command with the option `indextargets` is used to retrieve and update the metadata indexes from the specified or default APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) repositories, without actually installing or upgrading any packages. This process is necessary before performing other package management tasks such as installing new software or upgrading existing ones. By updating the package index, `apt-get` ensures that it has the most recent information about available packages and their versions.'
