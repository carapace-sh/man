documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `dlv core` command is used in Delve debugger (dlv), a popular Go debugging tool, to start a new debugging session with an already running Go program without attaching to it interactively. This command loads the core file generated by a previous gdb or SIGSTOP event, allowing post-mortem analysis of the program''s state at the time of the event. When used without further options, `dlv core` will attempt to automatically detect the correct core file based on the most recent running Go process and begin debugging.'
