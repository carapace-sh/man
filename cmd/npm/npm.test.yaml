documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm test` command is used to run tests specified in a project''s `package.json` file under the `scripts > test` key. This typically involves running a testing framework like Jest, Mocha or Jasmine using the installed testing packages in your Node.js project. The output provides information about which tests passed or failed, helping developers ensure code correctness and maintainability.'
    flag:
        ignore-scripts: '[AI] The `npm test --ignore-scripts` command is used when running tests in a Node.js project with npm (Node Package Manager). This command skips the execution of scripts listed in the "scripts" section of the package.json file and directly runs the tests specified under the "test" script or using custom test commands. It''s useful when you want to bypass any pre-test setup, such as building the project or installing dependencies, and just run the tests.'
        script-shell: '[AI] The `npm test --script-shell` command is used to run tests in Node.js projects with a specified shell environment instead of using the default node REE (Run-time Environment). This option can be useful when dealing with complex test environments that require specific shell configurations or commands not supported by Node.js. The `--script-shell` flag accepts a string value representing the shell to use, such as `bash`, `zsh`, or `cmd`.'
