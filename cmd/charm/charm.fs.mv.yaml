    command: '[AI] `charms-tools fs mv` is a Charm operator command used to move or rename files and directories within a Charm''s container filesystem in OpenStack Charms. It allows you to perform file system operations atomically, ensuring data consistency during the transition. This command is useful for managing application configuration files, logs, or other data that need to be moved or renamed as part of a Charm''s lifecycle.'
    flag:
        recursive: '[AI] The `charmeq fs mv --recursive` command is a Charmed OpenStack storage migration command in Charmaker or Juju, an open-source configuration management tool. This command performs a recursive file system move operation between two storage volumes or locations within the OpenStack File Service (Cinder). The `--recursive` flag ensures that all files and directories under the given paths are moved recursively, including their contents, making this a more comprehensive and powerful equivalent of the simple `mv` command.'
