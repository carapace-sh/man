    command: '[AI] The `go-tools-dist bootstrap` command is a part of the Go programming language''s toolchain, specifically the `go` tool. This command initializes a new Go installation by downloading and extracting the latest Go distribution files from Golang''s official website, setting up environment variables, and adding the Go binary to the system PATH. It also installs any missing required dependencies. In summary, it sets up a standalone Go development environment on a new machine.'
    flag:
        a: '[AI] `go-tool-dist bootstrap -a` is a command used in Go programming language development environment. This command initiates the process of creating a new Go installation from source, called "bootstraping," for all supported platforms with architectures (specified by the "-a" flag). The result will be self-contained Go installations that can be distributed to other systems.'
        d: '[AI] `go-tool-dist bootstrap -d` is a command used in the Go programming language ecosystem. It triggers the `bootstrap` process with the flag `-d` (short for `--download`) which instructs the tool to download and install necessary dependencies instead of using the ones already present on the system. This is useful when setting up a new Go development environment or when working on systems without pre-installed dependencies.'
        no-banner: |-
            [AI] `go-tool-dist` is a Go tool used to download and extract the Go distribution for offline use. The `bootstrap` command initializes an empty Go installation, or updates an existing one to the latest stable version.

            The option `-no-banner` disables the display of the welcome banner message that usually appears when running this command. By using this flag, the output will only include the progress and status messages related to downloading and extracting the Go distribution.
        no-clean: |-
            [AI] The `go-tool-dist bootstrap -no-clean` command is a part of Go programming language's toolchain, specifically the `bootstrap` subcommand under the `dist` directory.

            This command is used to create a standalone installation of the Go compiler and tools from source code, without requiring an existing Go installation. The `-no-clean` flag is optional and it prevents the tool from cleaning up the previous build before starting a new one. In other words, if `go-tool-dist bootstrap` is run multiple times in the same directory, without `-no-clean`, it will delete the existing Go installation each time, which can be undesirable for some use cases. With the `-no-clean` flag, the tool will add new installations instead of overwriting the old ones.
        v: '[AI] `go-tool-dist bootstrap -v` is a command used in the Go programming language to download and install the Go toolchain from source if it isn''t already installed, or update an existing installation to the latest version. The `-v` flag enables verbose output, providing detailed information about the downloading, extracting, and setting up of the Go tools during the process.'
