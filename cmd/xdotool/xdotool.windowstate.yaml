        [AI] `xdotool` is a versatile tool for interacting with the X11 window system programmatically. The `windowstate` sub-command is used to change the state of an open X11 window.

        With `xdotool`, you can query or modify the window state using its ID or handle. For instance, to list all open windows and their current states, use:

        ```bash
        xdotool getwindowlist --output name,state
        ```

        To change the state of a specific window (e.g., maximize the window with handle ID 0x12345678), execute:

        ```bash
        xdotool window id 0x12345678 windowstate maximized
        ```

        Here are common window states that can be set:
        - `iconic`: Minimize the window to the panel.
        - `shaded`: Minimize the window, but keep it in memory.
        - `normal`: Restore the window to its previous size and position.
        - `fullscreen`: Maximize a window to fill the entire screen.
        - `maximized_horz` or `maximized_vert`: Maximize a window horizontally or vertically, respectively.

        For more details and usage examples, consult the official `xdotool` documentation: https://github.com/jordanss/xdotool/wiki.
    flag:
        add: '[AI] `xdotool windowstate --add` is a command used in the xdotool tool, which allows interacting with the graphical environment of Linux and other Unix systems using the command line. Specifically, this command sets the window state of an existing X11 window to "normal" or "active". When you use `windowstate --add` followed by the ID or handle of a window, it adds this window to the focused or foreground group and brings it to the front of all other windows.'
        remove: '[AI] `xdotool` is a powerful tool for automating interactive tasks in X11, including manipulating windows. The command `xdotool windowstate --remove <window_id>` removes the specified window from its current state, typically minimizing it to the tray or taskbar if it''s maximized or restoring it to normal size and position if it''s minimized. The `<window_id>` can be obtained using various methods, such as querying the currently focused window, filtering windows by their titles, or using a combination of other options provided by xdotool.'
        toggle: '[AI] `xdotool` is a system utility for interacting with X11 windows. The command `xdotool windowstate --toggle` targets a specific window and toggles its state between maximized, minimized, or normal size based on its current state. When executed, this command will change the window''s size and position accordingly to either maximize it if it is currently minimized, minimize it if it is currently maximized, or leave it unchanged if it is already in a normal size.'
