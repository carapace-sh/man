documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nfpm completion` command is not a native PowerShell command but rather a part of the PowerShell extension for the Npm (Node Package Manager) package manager. This command generates PowerShell completions for Npm packages and commands, enabling more efficient tab-completion in PowerShell terminal sessions when working with Node.js projects. To use it, ensure that you have Node.js, PowerShell, and Npm installed, then run `nfpm` as your PowerShell execution policy allows.'
    flag:
        no-descriptions: |-
            [AI] The command `nfpm completion powershell --no-descriptions` is for PowerShell users, specifically those using the NuGet Package Manager (NFPM) in PowerShell sessions.

            This command generates autocompletion suggestions for NuGet package names when typing them in the PowerShell console. The `--no-descriptions` flag instructs NFPM not to include package descriptions in the autocompletion suggestions, which can make the suggestions list shorter and faster to scroll through.
