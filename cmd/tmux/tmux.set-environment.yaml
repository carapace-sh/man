    command: '[AI] `tmux set-environment` is a TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) command used to set or modify environment variables within the current or specified terminal session. The syntax is as follows: `tmux set-environment [-g] VARIABLE value`. The `-g` flag sets the variable globally across all sessions instead of just the current one. For example, `tmux set-environment VAR "value"` sets the variable `VAR` to `"value"` in the current session, while `tmux set-environment -g VAR "value"` sets it for all sessions.'
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `tmux set-environment` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to set or modify environment variables for the current or new sessions. The `-F` option modifies an existing environment variable by specifying a new value using a format string. For example, `tmux set-environment -F "%{TSH_COLORTERM:-%b}%{:1234567890}" VAR_NAME` sets the `VAR_NAME` environment variable to the value of the `TSH_COLORTERM` variable if it exists, or to the color codes `1234567890` otherwise.'
        g: '[AI] `tmux set-environment -g` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to set or modify environment variables globally across all sessions. The `-g` option indicates that the variable should be set for the entire system where tmux is running, and not just the current session. This can be useful for setting environment variables for applications running within tmux sessions, while maintaining consistency across multiple sessions.'
        h: '[AI] `tmux set-environment` is a command in the tmux terminal multiplexer to set or modify environment variables within the tmux sessions. The `-h` option stands for "help" and is used to display detailed information about the `set-environment` command, including its syntax and available options. So, using `tmux set-environment -h` will provide you with the necessary documentation to understand how to effectively use this command.'
        r: '[AI] `tmux set-environment -r` is a command in TMUX, the terminal multiplexer, used to remove an environment variable from the session''s environment. The `-r` option stands for "remove," and the command is typically followed by the name of the environment variable to be removed. For example, `tmux set-environment -r VARIABLE_NAME` will remove the ''VARIABLE_NAME'' from the TMUX session''s environment.'
        t: |-
            [AI] The `tmux` command `set-environment` is used to set or modify environment variables within a `tmux` session or pane. The syntax for this command is: `tmux set-environment [-g] [-p prefix] variable value [target]`.

            The option `-t` specifies the target to which the environment variable is applied. It can be either a named window, a window number, or the session itself (omitted). For example, `tmux set-environment -t :session1 VAR VALUE` sets the environment variable for all windows in the session named "session1". Without specifying a target, the environment variable is set for the current pane or session.
        u: '[AI] `tmux set-environment -u` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to unset (unset) environment variables. The `-u` option stands for "unset" and the command is typically followed by the name of the environment variable you want to remove from the Tmux session. For instance, running `tmux set-environment -u VAR_NAME` will remove the specified variable from your current Tmux session.'
