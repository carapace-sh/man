    command: '[AI] `tmux rename-window` is a TMUX command used to change the label or name of an existing window in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. To use it, first identify and select the target window using the `select-window` command with its corresponding index number (e.g., `select-window -t 0`) or name prefix (e.g., `select-window -n my_window_name`). Once selected, you can then rename it by running `rename-window <new_name>`, replacing `<new_name>` with the desired label for the window. After executing the command, the selected window will be renamed accordingly.'
