        [AI] `systemctl add-wants` is a command used in systemd-based Linux distributions to establish a dependency between a target unit and another unit. In simpler terms, it allows you to specify that a certain service or target should start automatically when the specified service or target is started or reloaded. This can be useful for ensuring that necessary services are running before others that depend on them. For example, if you have Service A and Service B, where Service B depends on Service A, you would use `systemctl add-wants` to tell systemd that Service B should start when Service A starts:

        ```bash
        sudo systemctl add-wants <ServiceB>.service <ServiceA>.service
        ```

        This command creates a symbolic link in the `/etc/systemd/system/<ServiceB>.service.wants/` directory, which contains the name of the wanted dependency (`<ServiceA>.service`). This tells systemd to start Service B whenever it starts or restarts Service A.
