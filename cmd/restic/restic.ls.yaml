documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `restic ls` command is used with the restic backup tool to list the backups stored in the repository. It displays detailed information about each backup, such as the backup''s name, size, and creation time. This command allows users to easily manage their backups and view the contents of the repository.'
    flag:
        host: '[AI] `restic ls --host` is a command from the backup tool called restic. This specific command lists the hosts where backups have been stored in the restic repository. It provides information such as hostnames or IP addresses, and for each host, it shows the size and number of backed-up data.'
        long: '[AI] `restic ls --long` is a command from the backup tool "restic". The `--long` option makes the output of the `ls` command more detailed, displaying each entry with multiple columns showing various attributes such as file size, modification time, and permissions. These columns provide a comprehensive overview of the files and directories listed in the backup repository.'
        path: '[AI] `restic ls --path` is a command from the backup tool called `restic`. The `ls` sub-command is used to list the backups stored in the repository. The `--path` option filters the output to only show the file paths of the backed up items, excluding other metadata like timestamps or sizes.'
        recursive: '[AI] `restic ls --recursive` is a command from the backup tool called `restic`. The `ls` subcommand lists files and directories, while `--recursive` (or `-R`) option enables recursive listing, meaning it will show all contents of the current directory and its subdirectories in a hierarchical format. It provides a tree-like representation of the file structure making it easier to inspect the backup data.'
        tag: '[AI] `restic ls --tag` is a command from the backup tool called `restic`. This command lists all the available tags in a given repository, which represent different points-in-time snapshots of data that have been backed up using `restic`. The option `--tag` tells `restic` to only display the tags instead of the detailed list of files and their metadata.'
