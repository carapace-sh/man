        [AI] `yarn cache` is a Yarn command used for managing the Yarn cache, which is a local repository that stores downloaded packages and their metadata to speed up the installation process. The command has several sub-commands:

        * `clean`: Removes the cached data to free up space or solve dependency resolution issues.
        * `list`: Lists the cached packages and their versions.
        * `global`: Manages globally installed packages, similar to npm's cache commands for those packages.
        * Without any sub-command, it displays general information about the cache.
