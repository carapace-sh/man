    command: '[AI] `node` is a command-line tool for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser environment. It loads and runs the specified JavaScript file using the Node.js engine, allowing developers to use JavaScript for server-side programming, building tools, automating tasks, and more.'
    flag:
        abort-on-uncaught-exception: '[AI] The `--abort-on-uncaught-exception` flag is a command line argument for Node.js, an open-source JavaScript runtime environment. When this flag is used during the execution of a Node.js script, the interpreter will terminate the process immediately if an uncaught exception occurs in the code. By default, Node.js continues running and logs the error to the console, but does not stop the process. This flag can be useful for developers during testing and debugging phases to identify and quickly address errors that might otherwise go unnoticed.'
        check: '[AI] `node --check` is a command-line tool provided by Node.js to run the TypeScript type checking compiler (tsc) during development. It automatically compiles and checks TypeScript files in real time as they''re saved, helping to catch type errors and other issues early, ensuring code consistency and reducing potential bugs. This flag can be used with a specific project or file path to check only that particular set of TypeScript files.'
        completion-bash: '[AI] `node --completion-bash` is a command used in Node.js to generate Bash script completions for Node.js related terms, such as file paths, module names, or scripts. This helps users of the Bash shell to easily autocomplete these terms while typing, improving productivity and reducing errors. When you run `node --completion-bash` in your terminal, it outputs a Bash script that, when sourced, adds the completions to your current Bash session.'
        conditions: '[AI] The `--conditions` flag in Node.js is used to specify a set of conditions that must be met before running a script or executing a specific task. These conditions can include environment variables, file existence checks, or other custom logic. When using the `node` command with this flag, Node.js will only proceed if these conditions are satisfied. It''s often used in combination with scripts and build tools to ensure that certain prerequisites are met before running more complex tasks.'
        cpu-prof: |-
            [AI] `node --cpu-profit` is a command used in Node.js to start a profiling session for generating CPU profiles. When you run this command, it starts a Node.js process with built-in profiling enabled. By default, the profiler generates a statistic profile, which provides aggregate information about where your JavaScript code spends most of its time during execution.

            This information is useful in identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing code. Once the profiling session is completed, you can use the Node.js V8 Profiler API or the `node-timeline-format` library to analyze the generated profiling data. The output format is based on the Timeline format, which includes information about the number of times each function was called and the amount of time spent in each function.
        cpu-prof-dir: '[AI] `node --cpu-prof-dir` is a command used to run Node.js with CPU profiling enabled and specify a directory for storing the generated profiling data. The profiling data provides detailed statistics about the execution time of various functions in your Node.js application, which can help you identify performance bottlenecks. When you run `node` with this option, it will automatically enable and start collecting CPU profiling information in the specified directory, which is typically a subdirectory of your project''s output directory. The resulting profile data can be later analyzed using various tools like Node.js built-in `--inspect-brk` or third-party tools like the Chrome DevTools or Node.js Visualizer.'
        cpu-prof-interval: '[AI] `node --cpu-prof-interval` is a command used in Node.js to generate CPU profiles. It enables continuous profiling at a specified interval (in milliseconds) to gather detailed information about the runtime behavior of JavaScript code and identify performance bottlenecks. The gathered data can then be analyzed using tools like Node.js built-in `--inspect-brk` with Chrome DevTools or external profilers like NYC or Node.js Profiler.'
        cpu-prof-name: '[AI] `node --cpu-prof-name` is a command used with Node.js to generate CPU profiling reports. The `--cpu-prof-name` option is used to specify a name for the generated profile file. When you run your Node.js script with this flag, it generates detailed information about how CPU time is spent in your application, which can help identify performance bottlenecks. The output is saved under the given name followed by `.prof` extension.'
        diagnostic-dir: '[AI] The `--diagnostic-dir` flag is a command-line option for Node.js, which specifies a directory where diagnostic files will be saved when using TypeScript with the Node.js compiler. These diagnostic files contain detailed error messages and other information that can help in understanding and resolving compilation errors or warnings. The flag allows developers to specify a custom output directory instead of the default location.'
        disable-proto: '[AI] The `--disable-proto` flag is a command-line option for Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime environment. When this flag is used while starting Node.js, it disables loading of built-in V8 Protobufer bindings. Protobuf (Protocol Buffers) is a Google-developed data serialization format and associated programming language. By disabling these bindings, users can avoid potential conflicts or unnecessary usage of Protocol Buffers within their Node.js applications.'
        disallow-code-generation-from-strings: '[AI] The `--disallow-code-generation-from-strings` flag is a Node.js CLI (Command Line Interface) option that disables the execution of code generated from strings during runtime. This helps improve security by preventing the execution of potentially malicious or untrusted code. It''s an extra layer to help prevent Code Injection attacks in your Node.js applications.'
        enable-fips: '[AI] `node --enable-fips` is a command used in Node.js, an open-source JavaScript runtime environment. This command line option enables Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) mode, which is a set of security standards issued by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Enabling FIPS mode restricts Node.js to use only cryptographic algorithms that are approved by NIST for use in government applications. This increases the security level but may limit the available cryptographic functions.'
        enable-source-maps: '[AI] The `--enable-source-maps` flag is a command-line option for Node.js when running scripts. When used, it enables the generation of source maps during the compilation and execution of JavaScript code. Source maps help in mapping the transformed code back to its original source during debugging. This can be particularly useful in complex applications or for third-party libraries where the original source might not be readily available.'
        eval: '[AI] `node --eval` is a command used to execute JavaScript code directly in the Node.js runtime environment without writing it to a file. The "--eval" option is passed to the Node.js interpreter, followed by the JavaScript code to be executed as an argument. For example, `node --eval "console.log(''Hello World'');"` will output "Hello World" when run in the terminal.'
        experimental-import-meta-resolve: '[AI] `node --experimental-import-meta-resolve` is a command used in Node.js to enable the experimental Import Meta Resolution feature. This feature allows Node.js to resolve imports using metadata in imported files, similar to how ECMAScript modules are resolved in browsers. It''s particularly useful when working with projects that use non-relative import statements or external dependencies without package.json files. The flag should be passed as an argument when starting the Node.js REPL or when running a script.'
        experimental-json-modules: '[AI] `node --experimental-json-modules` is a command used to run Node.js with an experimental feature enabled, allowing the use of Import and Export statements in JavaScript modules loaded from JSON files instead of traditional CommonJS or ES modules.

        experimental-loader: '[AI] The `--experimental-loader` flag is a command-line option for Node.js, which enables the use of experimental ES modules loaders during runtime. This flag allows Node.js to use new loader implementations before they are officially released and integrated into the core Node.js module system. Using this flag can help developers experiment with and adopt the latest ES module loading features, but it''s important to note that using experimental features may introduce compatibility issues or bugs.'
        experimental-policy: '[AI] The `--experimental-flags` or `--experimental-policy` option in Node.js allows the use of experimental features that are not yet stable and may change or be removed in future releases. By passing this flag, developers can enable specific experiments, such as new language features or underlying system improvements. Using experimental flags comes with the risk of encountering bugs or compatibility issues, so they should only be used for testing and development purposes. Always check the official Node.js documentation to see which experimental features are supported and their potential impacts on your project.'
        experimental-repl-await: '[AI] `node --experimental-repl-await` is a command used in Node.js to enable the use of `await` keyword within the REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) environment. This experimental feature allows asynchronous functions to be run interactively within the REPL console. By default, Node.js REPL does not support this syntax. Using this flag enables developers to test and experiment with asynchronous code in an interactive way.'
        experimental-specifier-resolution: '[AI] The `--experimental-specifier-resolution` flag is a command-line option for Node.js that enables the new CommonJS and ES module resolution behavior introduced in Node.js v14. It allows using both CommonJS and ES modules within the same project, with the default behavior being to use ES modules when importing files with the `.mjs` extension and CommonJS when importing other file types. This flag can be useful for developers who want to gradually migrate their projects to ES modules while still supporting CommonJS imports. Without this flag, attempting to mix both types of imports might result in errors or unexpected behavior.'
        experimental-vm-modules: '[AI] The `--experimental-vm-modules` flag is a command line argument for Node.js. It enables experimental support for ES modules in the Node.js runtime, allowing you to use `import` and `export` statements instead of CommonJS style modules in your Node.js applications. This flag is necessary because Node.js''s default behavior is to use CommonJS, but ES modules are gaining popularity due to their more modular and cleaner structure. Note that using this flag implies some potential risks as the feature may not be fully stable or compatible with all existing modules.'
        experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1: '[AI] The `node --experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1` command is used to run Node.js applications in the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) environment. WASI is an emerging standard for running WebAssembly modules outside of web browsers, providing a system interface and file I/O capabilities. The `--experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1` flag enables support for this experimental feature in Node.js. It''s important to note that using this flag may expose your application to instability and breaking changes as the WASI implementation is still under development.'
        experimental-wasm-modules: '[AI] The `node --experimental-wasm-modules` command is used to run Node.js with the experimental WebAssembly (WASM) support enabled. WASM is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It''s designed as a portable target for the compilation of high-performance C and C++ code, which can then be run in the browser or other environments, including Node.js. By enabling this experimental flag, you can load and execute WASM modules directly in Node.js, providing an alternative to traditional JavaScript execution for performance-critical applications that rely on C or C++ code.'
        force-context-aware: '[AI] The `--force-context-aware` flag is a command-line option for Node.js. It is used to enforce context-aware behavior in module resolution, which is the process of locating and loading modules in a Node.js application. When this flag is set, Node.js will prioritize finding modules that match the current working directory or file''s `node_modules` folder before searching in other global `node_modules` folders. This can be useful when working on a project with multiple independent packages and avoiding potential conflicts caused by loading the wrong module from an unexpected location.'
        force-fips: '[AI] `node --force-fips` is a command used in Node.js to enforce FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) compliance mode during runtime. FIPS is a set of security standards developed by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology).

        frozen-intrinsics: '[AI] `node --frozen-intrinsics` is a command-line option for Node.js that disables the redefinition of built-in (intrinsic) symbols in modules. This can be useful to prevent unintended overwriting or modification of Node.js core functionality when working with third-party packages or experimental code. With this flag, once an intrinsic symbol is set during Node.js initialization, it cannot be reassigned in user code, ensuring consistency and stability.'
        heap-prof: '[AI] `node --heap-prof` is a command used to run a Node.js script with the built-in Heap Snapshot profiling enabled. This flag generates a detailed report about the memory usage of your Node.js application, including object allocations and live data sizes. The generated profile file (a V8 heap snapshot file) can be analyzed using various profiling tools like Chrome DevTools or Node.js built-in `v8-profiler` library for further analysis. This information helps developers to identify memory leaks and optimize the memory usage in their applications.'
        heap-prof-dir: '[AI] `node --heap-prof-dir` is a command-line option for Node.js that enables Heap Profiling. This option sets the directory where Node.js will store profiling data files when the `v8.HeapProfiler.start()` and `v8.HeapProfiler.stop()` functions are called in your Node.js application. The generated data can be used for further analysis to identify memory leaks or other memory-related issues.'
        heap-prof-interval: '[AI] `node --heap-prof-interval` is a command-line option for Node.js to generate heap profiling reports. It specifies the interval (in milliseconds) between two successive heap snapshots during the profiling session. When you run your Node.js application with this flag, it will continuously take heap snapshots and store them in separate files. These files can be analyzed using tools like Node.js Visualizer or Chrome DevTools to identify memory leaks and other memory-related issues in your application.'
        heap-prof-name: '[AI] `node --heap-prof-name` is a command line option used with Node.js to generate heap profiling reports. This option sets a name for the output file of the heap snapshot and associated statistics, which can be later analyzed using tools like Chrome DevTools or Node''s built-in `v8-profiler` library. Heap profiling helps identify memory leaks and excessive object allocations by providing insights into live objects and their interconnections in the Node.js runtime.'
        heapsnapshot-near-heap-limit: '[AI] The `--heapsnapshot-near- heap-limit` flag is a command-line option for Node.js, used to take a heap snapshot when the JavaScript heap size is close to its limit. This can be useful for profiling and memory diagnosis. When enabled, V8, the JavaScript engine used by Node.js, will create a heap snapshot file (a `.heapsnapshot` file) whenever the total allocated heap size exceeds 90% of the maximum heap size. The snapshot file can then be analyzed using tools like Chrome DevTools or Node.js built-in `v8-profiler` package to identify memory leaks and allocate memory more efficiently.'
        heapsnapshot-signal: '[AI] `node --heapsnapshot-signal` is a command used to trigger a heap snapshot in Node.js using a Unix signal. This flag is passed when starting a Node.js process with the Node.js executable (`node`). By default, Node.js does not take heap snapshots during execution. However, this flag enables taking a heap snapshot at a specified point by sending a signal to the running process. This can be useful for profiling and memory analysis in Node.js applications.'
        help: '[AI] `node --help` is a command used in Node.js to display comprehensive information about available command line options and their usage. It provides a quick reference for users to understand how to run Node.js with various flags and arguments, making it easier to configure the environment for specific use cases.'
        icu-data-dir: '[AI] The `--icu-data-dir` flag is an option for Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment. It specifies the directory path where International Components for Unicode (ICU) data files are located. ICU is a widely used open-source library for handling Unicode and related internationalization functionality. By setting `--icu-data-dir`, Node.js applications can use ICU data files to correctly parse, compare, and format locale-specific strings, numbers, and dates.'
        input-type: |-
            [AI] The `--input-type` flag in Node.js is used to specify the format of the input files when using Node's built-in `fs.readFileSync()` or `fs.createReadStream()` functions. This flag helps Node.js correctly interpret and process the input files based on their file extensions (e.g., 'csv', 'json', 'xml'). For example, setting it to 'csv' would enable Node.js to parse CSV files using a built-in parser. The correct usage is:

            ```bash
            node myScript.js --input-type=<fileExtension>
            ```

            Replace `myScript.js` with the name of your script file and `<fileExtension>` with the desired file extension (e.g., 'csv', 'json').
        insecure-http-parser: |-
            [AI] The `--insecure-http-parser` flag is a command-line option for Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment. This flag disables the modern HTTP parser, which implements RFC 7540 and RFC 7231, and instead uses an insecure, older parser.

            This option was introduced to support older web servers that don't conform to the HTTP/1.1 specification, especially regarding chunked transfer encoding. However, it comes with potential security risks, as the older parser might not handle malformed HTTP headers properly, leading to potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or other security vulnerabilities.

            It is generally recommended to use the modern HTTP parser and ensure that your web servers are configured correctly rather than relying on this flag.
        inspect: '[AI] `node --inspect` is a command used to run Node.js applications with the built-in Debugger mode enabled. When you execute this command, it starts a new Node.js REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) instance and attaches the Node.js inspector tool, allowing you to debug your application in real-time. This is particularly useful when working on complex projects or trying to identify and resolve runtime errors or performance issues. The inspector tool can be accessed through various IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code, or through a web interface by opening `http://localhost:8000` in a browser.'
        inspect-brk: '[AI] `node --inspect-brk` is a command used in Node.js to start a new Node.js process with the built-in Debugger module enabled and paused at the very beginning of the script execution. The `--inspect-brk` flag combines two functionalities: `--inspect` for starting an inspector session, and `--brk` for breaking on the first line of the script. This command allows developers to inspect and debug their Node.js applications while they are running.'
        inspect-port: '[AI] `node --inspect-port` is a command used to start Node.js with the built-in Debugger mode enabled and the debugging port exposed on a specified number, usually for remote debugging. When you run this command in your terminal or command prompt, Node.js will initialize a new process with the inspector protocol active and listen for connections on the given port. This allows other development tools like Chrome DevTools to connect to the Node.js application and start debugging it remotely.'
        inspect-publish-uid: '[AI] `node --inspect-publish-uid` is a command used in Node.js development to publish source maps with unique User IDs when using the Chrome DevTools for debugging. The `--inspect-publish-uid` flag generates a new UID each time it''s run, ensuring that each deployed bundle has a distinct source map ID. This helps prevent conflicts between different deployments when multiple developers are working on the same project.'
        interactive: '[AI] `node --interactive` is a command used to start the Node.js REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) environment. In simpler terms, it opens an interactive Node.js session in your terminal where you can input JavaScript code snippets that are then executed on the spot, and their results are displayed immediately. This command is particularly useful for quick testing and experimenting with Node.js code without having to create a new file or setting up a project.'
        jitless: |-
            [AI] The `--jitless` flag for Node.js is used to disable Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. JIT is a technique used by some JavaScript engines, including V8 (used in Node.js), to improve performance by compiling the code on-the-fly as it is executed. This can lead to faster execution, but it also adds complexity and may consume more memory.

            By using `--jitless`, you are instructing Node.js to use Interpreted mode instead, where the JavaScript code is executed in an interpreter without JIT compilation. This results in simpler and more predictable behavior, but with a potential performance cost since the code isn't being optimized on-the-fly. It can be useful for testing or debugging purposes, or when dealing with complex or unstable codebases.
        max-http-header-size: '[AI] The `--max-http-header-size` flag is a command-line option for Node.js when running an HTTP server. It sets the maximum size (in bytes) of headers that can be received in a single request. If a request with headers larger than this limit is received, Node.js will throw an error and terminate the process. This helps prevent memory exhaustion or other issues caused by unusually large header sizes.'
        napi-modules: '[AI] `node --napi-modules` is a command used in Node.js to enable the use of Native Addons (NAPIs) built with Node.js''s C API, such as those developed using addon binding tools like N-API or nan. By passing this flag when starting the Node.js runtime, you can load and use these native modules alongside JavaScript modules in your application, extending its capabilities to interact directly with system functionalities or hardware.'
        no-deprecation: '[AI] The `--no-deprecation` flag is a command-line option for Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to suppress deprecation warnings that are issued when running Node.js code with certain outdated or deprecated features. By setting this flag, developers can choose to ignore these warnings and allow potentially problematic code to run without interference. However, it''s important to note that ignoring deprecation warnings could lead to unintended consequences and potential compatibility issues in the future. It is generally recommended to address the root cause of the deprecated code before running with this flag.'
        no-force-async-hooks-checks: |-
            [AI] The `--no-force-async-hooks-checks` flag is a command-line option for Node.js. It disables checks for Async Local Storage (ASL) and async functions use in the main thread outside of "await" or "async function" context.

            In Node.js versions before v13, using ASL or asynchronous functions directly outside of an "await" or "async function" would result in a runtime error. Starting from v13, these checks are enforced by default to ensure compatibility with the upcoming v14's Fetch API and other async-related features.

            By setting `--no-force-async-hooks-checks`, you can override this behavior and allow the use of ASL and asynchronous functions outside of "await" or "async function" context in your main thread code. This might lead to potential issues, but it could be necessary for backward compatibility with older Node.js modules or specific use cases.
        no-warnings: '[AI] The `--no-warnings` flag for Node.js is used to suppress all warning messages during the execution of a script or module.
