documentation:
    command: '[AI] "Dagger completion" is a feature in Dagger, a dependency injection framework for Java and Kotlin, that provides smart suggestions for writing Dagger code. It uses Autocomplete and Code Snippets to help developers write dependency graphs more efficiently by suggesting injected members, methods, and types based on the context of the code being written. This can save time and reduce errors when defining dependencies and using them in your application.'
