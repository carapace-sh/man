    command: '[AI] The `wezterm cli move-pane-to-new-tab` command is used in WezTerm, a customizable terminal emulator, to move an existing pane into a new tab. When this command is executed, the selected pane will be duplicated and placed in a new tab while its previous tab will close.

            [AI] `wezterm cli move-pane-to-new-tab` is a command in WezTerm terminal emulator's CLI (Command Line Interface). This command moves the currently selected pane in a tab to a new tab. In other words, it splits the current tab into two and moves the content of the selected pane to the new tab. The `--help` option is used for displaying detailed information about this command, such as its usage, available options, and their descriptions. However, since you asked for a concise explanation, here's the basic gist:

            This command does the following:
            - Moves the currently selected pane in the current tab to a new tab.
            - The newly created tab will contain only the moved pane.

            Using it with `--help` option won't change its functionality but will display more detailed information about it, including the correct usage format and available options if any.
        new-window: '[AI] The command `wezterm cli move-pane-to-new-tab --new-window` is used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator, to move an existing pane (split in a terminal window) to a new tab within a new WezTerm window. This can be helpful for organizing multiple related tasks into separate windows or sessions.'
        pane-id: '[AI] The `wezterm cli move-pane-to-new-tab --pane-id` command is used in Wezterm, a customizable terminal emulator, to move the specified pane (identified by its ID) to a new tab. This operation splits the current tab into two, with the moved pane in the new tab. The syntax `--pane-id` refers to providing an argument containing the unique identifier of the pane that will be moved.'
        window-id: '[AI] The `--move-pane-to-new-tab --window-id` flag is used in Wezterm, a versatile terminal emulator for Unix-like systems and Windows. This flag instructs Wezterm to move the current pane within a tab to a new tab, creating a new tab if necessary. The `--window-id` argument specifies the ID of the Wezterm window where this operation should be performed. In summary, it splits the current tab into two if there''s only one tab and moves the selected pane to a new tab within that window.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `wezterm cli move-pane-to-new-tab --workspace` command is a Wezterm terminal emulator (CLI) instruction used to move an open pane in a Wezterm tab to a new tab within the same Wezterm workspace. This can be useful for organizing and managing multiple terminal sessions within the same workspace. The `--workspace` argument ensures that the new tab is created within the current Wezterm workspace, keeping related sessions grouped together.'
