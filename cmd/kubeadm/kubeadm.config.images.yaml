description: Interact with container images used by kubeadm
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm config images` command is used to configure Kubernetes clusters managed by Kubeadm to use specific image registries and tags for the base operating system (OS) and Kubernetes components. By default, Kubeadm uses a set of officially-supported container images from the Google Container Registry (GCR). However, you can modify this behavior by creating a `kubelet-config.yml` file with custom image configurations and passing it to `kubeadm init` or `kubeadm join`. The command retrieves the current image configuration from the Kubernetes cluster, which includes the base OS images and the container images for various Kubernetes components like the kubelet, etcd, and APIServer.'
