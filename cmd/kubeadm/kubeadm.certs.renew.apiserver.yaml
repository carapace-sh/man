description: Renew the certificate for serving the Kubernetes API
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save the certificates
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubeconfig=: The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster. If the flag is not set, a set of standard locations can be searched for an existing kubeconfig file.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew apiserver` is a command used to renew the TLS certificates for the Kubernetes API server. This command is typically run on a system where `kubeadm` is installed and used to manage a Kubernetes cluster. The `renew` subcommand is used to renew specific certificates, in this case, the one used by the API server. Renewing these certificates helps maintain secure communication between clients and the API server, as expired or nearly-expired certificates can cause issues with cluster functionality and potentially expose the cluster to security vulnerabilities.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew apiserver --cert-dir` is a command used to renew the TLS certificates for the Kubernetes Apiserver in an existing cluster managed by Kubeadm. The `--cert-dir` flag specifies the directory where the existing certificates are located. This command regenerates the expired or near-expiration certificates to maintain a secure and functional Kubernetes cluster.'
        config: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew apiserver` is a command used to renew the TLS certificates for the Kubernetes API server using the `kubeadm` tool. The `--config` option specifies the configuration directory for `kubeadm`. When you run this command, `kubeadm` will regenerate the API server''s SSL/TLS certificates and key files, ensuring secure communication between the Kubernetes components.'
        kubeconfig: |-
            [AI] The command `kubeadm certs renew apiserver --kubeconfig <file.yaml>` is used to renew the TLS certificates for the Kubernetes API server using `kubeadm`. The `--kubeconfig` option specifies the path to a specific Kubernetes configuration file, which is used to locate and interact with the cluster.

            When you run this command, `kubeadm` will generate new TLS certificates for the API server and save them in the appropriate directory (usually `/etc/kubernetes/pki/`). The renewed certificates will automatically be applied to the API server during its next restart or when you use the `systemctl restart kube-apiserver.service` command. This process helps ensure that your cluster remains secure by keeping the TLS certificates up-to-date and minimizing the risk of expired or compromised certificates.
