    command: '[AI] The `brew home` command is a shortcut provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to display the path of your Homebrew installation directory. This can be useful when configuring scripts or symlinks that require access to the Homebrew binaries or formulae.'
    flag:
        cask: '[AI] `brew home --cask` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--cask` option specifies that you''re working with Cask packages, which are graphical applications bundled as PKG files, rather than Command Line Tools or other types of packages. When you use `brew install` followed by a Cask formula name (for example, `brew install --cask visual-studio-code`), Homebrew downloads and installs the application package along with any required dependencies.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew home --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command sets Homebrew to run in debug mode for the current shell session. In debug mode, Homebrew prints detailed information about the operations it performs, which can be helpful for troubleshooting and understanding how Homebrew functions.'
        formula: '[AI] `brew home --formula` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command displays information about a formula in Homebrew''s repository. A formula is a set of instructions that tells Homebrew how to install and manage software packages. When you run `brew home --formula <name>`, replace `<name>` with the name or slug of the desired formula, Homebrew will return detailed information about that formula, including its source, dependencies, build steps, and other relevant metadata.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `brew help home` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command displays detailed help information about the `home` formula or tap in Homebrew. The `home` term may refer to a specific Homebrew formula for installing software like Docker Desktop or Google Cloud SDK, or it could be used in reference to the `home` tap, which is where custom Homebrew formulas can be installed from.

            When run with the `--help` flag, the command provides information on how to use the given `home` component effectively and efficiently. It explains options, usage examples, and other relevant details that will facilitate a successful installation or management of the software associated with the `home` formula or tap.
        quiet: '[AI] `brew home --quiet` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command sets the Homebrew installation prefix to the default location (usually /usr/local), but it does so quietly without displaying any message or confirmation. It''s useful when you want to run other Homebrew commands without interruption and don''t need to see the "Homebrew has been successfully installed" message.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew home --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command displays detailed information about Homebrew''s installation directory (also known as the Homebrew Cellar). The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output provided, allowing users to see precise paths and other relevant details.'
