name: port [OPTIONS] SERVICE PRIVATE_PORT
description: Print the public port for a port binding.
flags:
    --index=: index of the container if service has multiple replicas
    --protocol=: tcp or udp
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker-compose port` command is used to publish a container''s port to the host machine in Docker Compose file configurations. It maps the container''s port to a specific port on the host, allowing external applications or services to connect to the container using that published port. This enables communication between containers and the outside world. The general syntax for this command is: `docker-compose up --publish <host_port>:<container_port> [--detach/-d] [<project_name>]` where `<host_port>` is the port number on the host machine, and `<container_port>` is the corresponding port number in the container.'
    flag:
        index: |-
            [AI] The `docker-compose port --index` command is a subcommand used within Docker Compose to display a list of ports mapped by services in a defined Compose file, along with their corresponding index numbers.

            When you run this command without any other flags or options, it will output the mapping of each service's published port to the host port and its index number. The index is zero-based, meaning that the first port is indexed as 0, the second as 1, and so on. This information can be useful for understanding the network communication setup within your Docker environment.
        protocol: '[AI] The `docker-compose port` command is used to publish a container''s port for external access when defining services in a Docker Compose file. The `--protocol` option specifies the network protocol (TCP or UDP) to be used for the published port. For instance, `docker-compose up --publish 80:80 --publish-protocol tcp` exposes port 80 using TCP protocol.'
