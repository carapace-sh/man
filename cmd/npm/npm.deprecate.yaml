    command: '[AI] The `npm deprecate` command is a Node.js package manager (npm) command used to mark a specific package version as deprecated. Deprecation indicates that the package version is no longer recommended for use due to various reasons such as security vulnerabilities, incompatibility with newer versions or best practices changes. By using `npm deprecate`, you create a new Git tag and update the package''s `package.json` file with a deprecation notice.

    flag:
        otp: '[AI] `npm deprecate --otp` is a command used in npm (Node Package Manager) to mark a package as having reached its end-of-life and should no longer be used. The `--otp` flag stands for "one-time password" and is used when the repository owner wants to provide a one-time, irrevocable deprecation notice that cannot be undone. When this command is run, it generates a unique, irreversible deprecation message and adds it to the package''s `package.json` file. After running this command, users are advised to migrate to an alternative package or find a replacement for the deprecated one.'
