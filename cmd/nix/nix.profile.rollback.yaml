documentation:
    command: '[AI] `nix-profile rollback` is a Nix Pacman command used to revert a Nix profile (a directory containing user-installed packages) to an earlier version. This command takes no argument and simply reverts the profile to the previously saved state, discarding any changes made since then. It can be useful when unintended or problematic package installations occur, allowing users to restore their profiles to a previous known working state.'
    flag:
        dry-run: '[AI] `nix-profile rollback --dry-run` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This command simulates a rollback operation without actually making any changes. A rollback undoes the latest change or upgrade made to a user''s profile (a collection of installed packages). The `--dry-run` option provides a preview of what would be done, allowing users to review the effects before executing the command in a production environment.'
        profile: '[AI] The `nix-profile rollback --profile <profile_name>` command is used to revert changes made in a specific Nix profile to an earlier version. Nix is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems, and Nix profiles are collections of configuration settings and packages managed by Nix. The `rollback` command allows you to restore the previous state of a profile, undoing any modifications or updates made since then. By specifying a particular profile name, the command will only affect that specific profile and not others.'
        to: '[AI] The `nix-profile rollback --to <revision>` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems, to revert the current system configuration to a previous saved state. The `<revision>` argument specifies the desired revision number or tag name of the Nix profile to rollback to. This can be useful when you want to undo changes made by applying new configurations or updates that caused issues with your system. It''s important to note that rolling back might also undo any new packages installation, so it''s essential to consider the consequences before using this command.'
