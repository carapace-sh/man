documentation:
    command: '[AI] `restic recover` is a command used in restic, a versatile backup program. This command is responsible for the restoration of specific files or directories from a restic backup. The user specifies the backup ID and the path to the desired file or directory to be recovered. Restic will then retrieve the specified data from the backup store and write it back to its original location, if possible, or to a new location if the original one is no longer available. This command plays an essential role in data recovery processes using restic.'
