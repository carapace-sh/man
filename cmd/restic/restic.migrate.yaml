documentation:
    command: '[AI] `restic migrate` is a command in the Restic backup tool. It''s used to migrate backups from one repository (storage location) to another while keeping the data and metadata consistent. This command preserves the relationship between different versions of files, directories, and their respective snapshots during the migration process. It also ensures that all access control lists and other file properties are maintained in the new repository. In summary, `restic migrate` facilitates moving backups from one location to another while maintaining the data integrity and metadata consistency.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `restic migrate --force` is a command used in Restic, a backup program, to perform a forced migration of data between backups storage targets. This means that if there are any conflicts during the migration process, such as existing data with the same hashes in both source and target, Restic will overwrite the data at the target without asking for confirmation. The `--force` option is used when it''s necessary to bypass potential errors or warnings during the migration process.'
