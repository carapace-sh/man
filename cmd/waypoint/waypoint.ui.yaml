documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "waypoint ui" command is specific to the ArduPilot autopilot system used in drones and other unmanned vehicles. It is not a standard Linux or general-purpose computing command. This command is used to display the Waypoint UI (User Interface) on the Ground Control Station (GCS) software, which allows users to define, view, and modify waypoints for autonomous flight missions. Waypoints are predefined geographical locations that the vehicle will navigate to during autonomous flights. The UI provides visualization of each waypoint''s location, sequence, and other relevant data.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] `waypoint ui --app` is a command used in Waypoint, an open-source application delivery platform by Microsoft. This command initializes and sets up a new Waypoint UI application, which can be used to manage and monitor applications delivered through Waypoint. The "--app" flag specifies that this command will be run within the context of an existing Waypoint application stack.'
        authenticate: '[AI] The `--authenticate` flag for the `waypoint ui` command in Terraform is used to initiate the authentication process with the Waypoint server. Waypoint is an open-source application delivery platform that provides continuous delivery and security scanning. This flag starts the interaction between the user''s local CLI and the Waypoint server, allowing you to securely authenticate, manage applications, and infrastructure through the UI.'
        plain: '[AI] `waypoint ui --plain` is a command used in Waypoint, an open-source application delivery and infrastructure automation platform. The `--plain` flag modifies the output format of Waypoint''s UI (User Interface) to be plain text without any additional formatting or colorization. This can be useful for integrating Waypoint output with other tools or scripts that may not support rich text formats.'
        project: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint ui --project` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source continuous delivery and infrastructure automation platform by Docker. This command interacts with the Waypoint UI (User Interface) to manage and view projects configured within Waypoint.

            The `--project` flag specifies the name or ID of a particular project for which the UI should be displayed or managed. For instance, `waypoint ui --project my-project` will open the UI for the project named "my-project". This command is helpful in managing multiple projects from a single Waypoint installation and offers a visual representation of each project's current configuration.
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint ui --workspace` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source continuous delivery and infrastructure automation tool. This specific command opens the Waypoint UI (User Interface) in a web browser to manage and visualize your Waypoint workspaces. A workspace in Waypoint represents a logical grouping of application components, environments, and configurations. The UI provides an easy-to-use interface for deploying, scaling, and managing these resources.'
