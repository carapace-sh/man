flags:
    --include-sdk: if set, will include the used SDK files in the archive file
    --out=: 'the output file. Use: ''-'' for stdout'
    --sdk=: the default SDK path to use
    --toitc=: the default toit compiler to use
    -v, --verbose: ""
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `toit lsp archive` command is used in Toit, a modern object-oriented programming language, to interact with Language Server Protocol (LSP) enabled editors or IDEs for code analysis and autocompletion features. This specific command archives previously indexed files or directories, preparing them for efficient transmission to the LSP server for further processing. It helps improve the overall performance and responsiveness of the language server by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted each time the editor requests information.'
    flag:
        include-sdk: '[AI] The command `toit lsp archive --include-sdk` is a Toit Language Server Process (LSP) command used for archiving and including the SDK (Software Development Kit) during the creation or update of an LSP index in Toit IDEs. This action ensures that the necessary SDK files are available for code completion, error reporting, and other advanced features offered by the LSP when editing or navigating Toit source code.'
        out: '[AI] The `toit lsp archive --out` command in Toit programming language is used to generate an Language Server Protocol (LSP) archival format of a project or workspace. The resulting file contains metadata and indexing information for the codebase, enabling clients such as IDEs and text editors to request intelligent features like autocomplete, code navigation, and diagnostics effectively.'
        sdk: '[AI] The `toit lsp archive --sdk` command is a part of Toit, an object-oriented, statically typed programming language. This specific command is used for generating an LSP (Language Server Protocol) archival package of the Toit SDK (Software Development Kit). An LSP archival package is a compact and self-contained representation of a language server''s functionality which can be easily shared, transported, or installed in various code editors that support LSP. The command gathers all necessary information about the Toit SDK, including its interfaces, symbols, and other metadata required for effective language server interaction with IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).'
        toitc: '[AI] The `toit lsp archive --toitc` command is used in Toit programming language for creating an archived Library Service Package (LSP). An LSP is a collection of Toit libraries, modules, and other resources that can be easily shared and reused across different projects. The `--toitc` flag specifies the output format as compressed Toit archive files. This command generates a single archive file containing all referenced resources, making it convenient for distribution and dependency management in Toit projects.'
        verbose: '[AI] The command `toit lsp archive --verbose` is used in the Toit programming language''s LSP (Language Server Protocol) extension for retrieving information about archives with increased detail or verbosity. An archive in Toit refers to a collection of compiled modules that can be loaded and run together as a single unit. The `--verbose` flag instructs the command to print out more detailed information during the process of listing these archives, including any diagnostic messages, for better understanding of the build process.'
