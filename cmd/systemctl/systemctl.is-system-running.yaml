documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `systemctl` command with the `is-system-running` argument is used to check the current system runlevel or state in Systemd initiated systems. It returns "running" if the system is currently running, and "not running" if it is not (or if it''s in transition between states). The output can be checked by looking at the exit status (0 for running, non-zero for not) or parsing the output message.'
