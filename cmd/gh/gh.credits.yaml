    command: '[AI] The `gh credits` command is used in the GitHub CLI (Gh) to display a list of your personal access tokens and their associated scopes, as well as their creation and expiration dates. It helps you manage and keep track of your access tokens for securely interacting with GitHub APIs or services that require authentication.'
    flag:
        static: '[AI] `gh credits --static` is a command used in GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, called gh. This command is used to manage GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs). The `--static` flag indicates that the new token generated should be a read-only or static token. In other words, this command generates a token with limited permissions, allowing only reading of GitHub resources, but no writing or other actions. This can be useful for automation scripts that don''t need write access.'
