        [AI] The `npm dist-tag add` command is used to associate a specific tag with a particular version of an npm package in the npm registry. This can be useful for marking certain versions as releases, previews of upcoming major versions, or other designated labels.

        The basic syntax is: `npm dist-tag add <package-name> <tag-name> <version>`

        For example, if you wanted to associate the tag "beta" with version 2.3.1 of the package "my-package":

        `npm dist-tag add my-package beta 2.3.1`
