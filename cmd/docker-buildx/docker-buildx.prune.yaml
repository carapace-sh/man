documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker buildx prune` is a command used with Docker Buildx, an extension of the standard Docker engine that adds support for building multi-context and large Docker images using multiple nodes or workers. The `prune` subcommand is used to remove unused buildx contexts, build artifacts, and intermediate containers that are no longer needed. By running this command, you can clean up your Buildx environment and free up resources.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `docker buildx prune --all` is a command used in Docker to manage buildx, a powerful multi-context builder. This specific command is for removing unused buildx resources, such as build nodes and their associated images, to keep the setup lean and efficient. The `--all` flag means that it will remove all unused resources across all buildx contexts.'
        filter: '[AI] `docker buildx prune --filter` is a command used with Docker Buildx, an extension of Docker that enables building container images using multiple buildx contexts and build nodes. The `prune` subcommand is used to remove unused or unnecessary build resources, such as caches and images that are no longer needed. The `--filter` option allows you to specify filters for which resources to prune. For example, `--filter="docker-dind"` would only prune DIND (Docker in Docker) related resources. By using this command, you can keep your build environment clean and efficient.'
        force: '[AI] `docker buildx prune --force` is a command used with Docker Buildx, an extension of Docker that adds support for building multistage and canary images using multiple buildx contexts. The `prune` subcommand is used to remove unused Buildx contexts, dockerfiles, and intermediate images. The `--force` option forces the removal of these resources without any confirmation prompts.'
        keep-storage: |-
            [AI] `docker buildx prune --keep-storage` is a command used with Docker Buildx, an extension of Docker that adds support for building multi-stage images using multiple buildx workers. The `prune` subcommand is used to remove unused build artifacts such as dockerfiles, cache, and intermediates.

            The `--keep-storage` flag tells Docker to keep the storage used by these build artifacts, even after they have been pruned. This can be useful when you want to save disk space without losing the build artifacts, as they may still be needed for future builds or troubleshooting.

            So in summary, `docker-buildx prune --keep-storage` removes unused build artifacts while keeping the storage they occupy.
        verbose: '[AI] `docker buildx prune --verbose` is a command used with Docker Buildx, an extension of Docker that adds support for building multi-stage images using multiple buildx contexts. The `prune` subcommand is used to remove unused buildx contexts and associated resources such as dockerfiles and cached build artifacts. The `--verbose` flag increases the output level of information to provide more detailed information about which buildx contexts and associated resources are being removed during the pruning process.'
