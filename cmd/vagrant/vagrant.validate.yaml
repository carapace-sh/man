description: Validates a Vagrantfile config
flags:
    -p, --ignore-provider: Ignores provider config options
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vagrant validate` is a Vagrant command used to check if all configuration files in a Vagrant project are valid and correctly formatted, without actually starting or provisioning the virtual machine. It performs syntax checking on the Vagrantfile and other configuration files, ensuring they conform to the Vagrant specification and are ready for use with Vagrant.'
    flag:
        ignore-provider: '[AI] The `vagrant validate` command is a Vagrant built-in command used to check the configuration files and validity of a Vagrant project. When you use the option `--ignore-provider`, you instruct Vagrant to skip the validation checks specific to individual providers. This means that Vagrant will still perform checks on the Vagrantfile, but it won''t check for errors or compatibility issues related to the provider (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Fusion). Using this option might help you when dealing with configuration issues not directly related to the providers, or if you want to intentionally ignore potential warnings or errors from a specific provider.'
