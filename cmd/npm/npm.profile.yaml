    command: '[AI] The `npm profile` command is used to view and manage your npm (Node Package Manager) configuration profiles. Profiles allow you to set default registry, authentication, and other options for use during package installation or publishing. You can create multiple profiles for different use cases, such as a personal and a professional account. By running `npm profile`, you can list the available profiles, view details of each one, or switch between them.'
