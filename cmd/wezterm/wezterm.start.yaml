documentation:
    command: '[AI] `wezterm start` is a command used in the WezTerm terminal emulator to open a new terminal session. When executed, it initializes a new WezTerm instance with default configurations and connects it to the specified terminal server or local process if provided as an argument. If no arguments are given, a new local terminal session is started instead.'
    flag:
        always-new-process: '[AI] `wezterm start --always-new-process` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for Unix and Windows. This option ensures that a new terminal process is launched every time the command is executed. It overrides any previously running instance of the same terminal tab, creating a fresh environment. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to ensure that each new session starts with a clean slate, such as development environments or interactive shells.'
        attach: '[AI] `wezterm start --attach` is a command used in the Wezterm terminal emulator to attach an existing session instead of starting a new one. When you run this command, Wezterm connects to the current terminal process and takes control of it, bringing up the Wezterm user interface while keeping the underlying terminal session intact. This can be useful when you want to continue using a running terminal session from within Wezterm or when you''re working in a graphically demanding environment that requires advanced features provided by Wezterm.'
        class: '[AI] `wezterm start --class` is a command used in the WezTerm terminal emulator for macOS. This command starts a new instance of WezTerm with the given class name, which can be useful for customizing window management and appearance using third-party tools like `wmctrl`, `iTerm2`, or `Spectacle`. For example, if you want to automatically resize or arrange the terminal window when it''s launched, you might use an automation tool to look for windows with a specific class name (in this case, "--class") and apply your desired settings.'
        cwd: '[AI] `wezterm start --cwd` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for Unix-based systems. The `start` subcommand launches a new WezTerm session, and the `--cwd` option sets the current working directory (cwd) of the session to the provided path. In summary, this command starts a new WezTerm session with the specified working directory.'
        domain: '[AI] `wezterm start --domain` is a command used in the WezTerm terminal emulator to open a new tab with a specific SSH or TELNET session based on a predefined configuration stored in a domain file. The `--domain` option specifies the name of the domain file, and `start` initiates the connection. This command simplifies managing complex terminal sessions by allowing users to easily organize and access them using descriptive names instead of long, complex connections strings.'
        help: '[AI] `wezterm start --help` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for interacting with Unix-based systems and Windows. The `--help` argument displays detailed information about the `start` command''s usage and available options, assisting users in properly configuring and running WezTerm sessions.'
        no-auto-connect: '[AI] `wezterm start --no-auto-connect` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator, to open a new tab or window without automatically connecting to any remote server or SSH session. The `--no-auto-connect` option prevents the terminal from attempting to reestablish any previous connections when it is launched. This can be useful when you want to manually manage your sessions or work in a local environment without being distracted by automatic connections to remote servers.'
        position: '[AI] `wezterm start --position` is a command used in the Wezterm terminal emulator to open a new tab or window at a specific location on the screen. The `--position` option takes two arguments, representing the row and column numbers of the grid layout. For example, `--position=0,0` will open a new tab or window at the top-left corner of the screen.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `--workspace` flag is used with Wezterm, a customizable terminal emulator for Unix-based systems. This flag is passed to the `wezterm start` command and it sets up or activates a specific workspace in Wezterm. A workspace represents a collection of tabs, panes, and terminal sessions that are related to each other in some way. By using workspaces, users can easily organize their terminal sessions and switch between them with a single keystroke.'
