        exit-status: '[AI] `gh run watch` is a GitHubActions command used to run and monitor a workflow locally with real-time feedback. The `--exit-status` flag indicates that the command should return an exit status code reflecting the result of the last task in the workflow, allowing for easier integration testing and error handling.'
        interval: '[AI] `gh run watch` is a GitHubActions command used to watch for changes in a repository and trigger workflows in response. The `--interval` option sets a specified interval at which GitHub checks for changes, defaulting to 5 minutes. When combined with `gh run watch`, this command continuously monitors the repository for new events and runs the defined workflow whenever an event occurs or when the set interval is reached.'
