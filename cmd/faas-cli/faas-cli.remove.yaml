documentation:
    command: '[AI] `faas-cli remove` is a command used in the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) toolchain provided by OpenFaaS. This command is used to delete an existing function from the local registry and, optionally, also from the deployed FunctionProxies in the cluster. It helps keep your local environment and clusters synchronized with your codebase.'
    flag:
        envsubst: '[AI] `faas-cli remove --envsubst` is a command used in the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) toolchain, specifically with the FaaS CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. This command is used to remove an environment variable from a FaaS function''s configuration. The `--envsubst` flag is optional and it enables in-line substitution of environment variables referenced in the configuration file before removal. This means that any occurrences of the environment variable name in the file will be replaced with their respective values before the environment variable is removed from the function''s configuration.'
        gateway: '[AI] The `faas-cli remove --gateway` command is used to delete a specific Faas Gateway in the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) architecture. The Faas Gateway acts as an API gateway, handling incoming HTTP requests and routing them to the appropriate functions. By using this command, you can remove a particular gateway configuration from your system, including its associated routes and functions associations. This can be helpful when you need to make changes or deletions to your FaaS infrastructure.'
        namespace: '[AI] The `faas-cli remove --namespace` command is used with the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) CLI tool to delete functions or applications deployed under a specific Kubernetes namespace. The `--remove` flag indicates that you want to delete resources, while `--namespace` specifies the namespace where the resources are located. By using this command, you can clean up unused or unwanted functions or applications from your Kubernetes cluster.'
        tls-no-verify: |-
            [AI] The `faas-cli remove --tls-no-verify` command is a Flag in the FaaS-CLI (Function as a Service Command Line Interface) tool used to remove a function or application definition from a FaaS provider like OpenFaaS.

            The `--tls-no-verify` flag disables SSL certificate verification during communication with the FaaS provider's API, which can be useful when working with self-signed certificates or testing environments where certificate validation might not be in place.

            However, it is important to note that using this flag in a production environment is not recommended as it poses a security risk due to potential man-in-the-middle attacks. The flag should only be used for development and testing purposes.
        token: '[AI] The `faas-cli remove --token` command is used with the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) CLI tool to delete a specific function token from the local configuration file. The `--token` argument specifies the token to be removed. This command helps ensure the security of your functions by allowing you to revoke access to individual tokens, which is especially useful when a token has been compromised or is no longer needed.'
