This command retrieves the value of a specific key-value pair from the Charm''s persistent storage using the KV (Key-Value) store. The command syntax usually looks like: `charms-tools kv get <charm-name> <key>`. It returns the value associated with the given key for the specified Charm.'

            [AI] The `charms` tool in OpenStack's Charms project includes a command named `kv get` under its `charm` sub-command. The `--show-binary` option is one of the available flags for this command.

            This flag instructs the `kv get` command to output the value of the specified key as raw binary data instead of the default string format. This can be useful when dealing with specific types of configuration data, such as binary files or large strings that cannot be easily handled as text in scripts or other automated processes.

            Here's a brief summary:
            - Command: `charms kv get`
            - Flag: `--show-binary`
            - Functionality: Outputs the value of a specified key as raw binary data instead of string format.
