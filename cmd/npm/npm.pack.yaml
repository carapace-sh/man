documentation:
    command: '[AI] `npm pack` is a command used in Node.js package management system, npm. It creates a source archive of your project''s `node_modules` directory and the current package.json file, making it ready to be published or distributed as an npm package. This command generates a .tgz (tarball gzip) file which can be uploaded to the npm registry for others to install using `npm install`.'
    flag:
        dry-run: '[AI] `npm pack --dry-run` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). This command simulates packaging a project into a tarball or zip file without actually creating the output files. It generates a list of actions that would be taken during the real packaging process, displaying them to the console for review. This can help users verify that they have correctly configured their `package.json` file and that all necessary dependencies are included before generating the actual package.'
        json: '[AI] `npm pack --json` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). It creates a source archive of the project, and at the same time generates a `package.json.tar.gz` file containing the `package.json` manifest with metadata about the project, such as name, version, dependencies, scripts, etc. This command is often used to prepare a package for publication on the npm registry or other package managers.'
        workspace: |-
            [AI] `npm pack --workspace` is a command used in Node.js projects managed with npm (Node Package Manager). It's part of the Workspaces feature, which allows creating and managing multiple packages within a single `node_modules` folder.

            The `pack` command compresses your project into a `.tgz` file suitable for publication to an npm registry. When used with the `--workspace` flag, it packs all the projects within the current workspace rather than just the active one. This is useful when you have multiple packages and want to build and publish them all at once.
        workspaces: '[AI] `npm pack --workspaces` is a command used in npm (Node Package Manager) when working with multiple packages within one project, called workspaces. This command compiles and generates source archives for all the workspaces defined in the package.json file under the current directory using a single `npm pack` command. The generated archives can then be published to an npm registry or distributed as local packages.'
