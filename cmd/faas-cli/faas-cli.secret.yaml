documentation:
    command: '[AI] `faas-cli secret` is a command provided by the FaaS-CLI (Function as a Service Command Line Interface) tool. It''s used to manage secrets in a FaaS (Function as a Service) environment. More specifically, it allows you to create, list, update, or delete encrypted secrets stored within an etcd database, which is often used as a backend for key-value pair storage in FaaS platforms like OpenFaas and FaaSd. These secrets can be referenced by functions to securely pass sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, without exposing them in the source code.'
