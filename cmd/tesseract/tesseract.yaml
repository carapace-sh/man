documentation:
    command: '[AI] Tesseract is an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine developed by Google. It''s designed to extract text from scanned images or handwritten texts, recognizing and translating various languages. Users can integrate Tesseract with applications for real-time text extraction. The software identifies characters, corrects errors using machine learning algorithms, and returns the text as output in multiple formats like plain text, HTML, LaTeX, etc.'
    flag:
        c: '[AI] `tesseract -c` is a command-line option for Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software. The `-c` flag stands for "config file" and is used to specify a configuration file that contains custom settings for the OCR process, such as language, page segmentation mode, or engine mode. By providing a config file, users can fine-tune the OCR results according to their specific needs.'
        dpi: '[AI] The `--dpi` option in Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software refers to Dots Per Inch, which is a measurement of image resolution. Tesseract uses this information to optimally set the engine''s internal resolution during recognition, ensuring accurate text extraction from scanned or digital images with high resolution. Providing `--dpi` argument improves OCR results by better matching the source document resolution, which in turn can reduce errors and improve overall recognition accuracy.'
        help: '[AI] `tesseract --help` is a command used with Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software to display available options and usage information. The flag "--help" requests that the program prints out detailed help information, including the various arguments and their descriptions, that can be used to configure its functionality for different image processing and text recognition tasks.'
        help-extra: '[AI] `tesseract --help-extra` is a command-line option for Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software. It provides an extensive list of advanced features and options that are not covered in the regular help text. These extra options allow fine-tuning and customization for specific OCR tasks, such as language models, page segmentation modes, and engine modes. For detailed information on these options, refer to the Tesseract documentation or use the `tesseract --help-extra` command with an input image file to see the full list.'
        help-oem: '[AI] The `--help-oem` option is a command-line argument for Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine. It is used to display the list of available OCR engines and data files (called OCR models or OEMs) that Tesseract supports. Each OEM has its unique name, version number, and description. Using `--help-oem` helps users understand which engines they have installed and can be useful for troubleshooting and selecting the right engine for their recognition tasks.'
        help-psm: '[AI] The `--help-psm` option in Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software is used to display a list of supported Page Segmentation Models (PSMs). PSMs are predefined schemes for identifying and separating regions or segments within an image that correspond to textual content. These models help Tesseract to more accurately recognize text by taking into account various layout features such as lines, words, and paragraphs in the input image. The available PSMs range from basic (single text line, single character) to complex (multiple columns, multi-line text).'
        l: '[AI] The command `tesseract -l` in OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is used to list all available languages and their corresponding OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine versions supported by Tesseract, the OCR engine embedded in OpenCV. It doesn''t process any image or text data but only returns a list of language codes and their associated version information for possible use during OCR processing.'
        list-langs: '[AI] `tesseract --list-langs` is a command-line utility provided by the Tesseract-OCR engine to list the available language models for text recognition. This command displays a comma-separated list of language codes and corresponding names, which can be used as an argument when running Tesseract with the `--lang` option to specify the desired language for text recognition. For example, `tesseract input.png output --lang en` would perform OCR on ''input.png'' using the English language model.'
        oem: '[AI] The `--oem` option in Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software is used to specify the output format for recognized text, especially when dealing with different languages or scripts. It can take values such as ''none'', ''esd'' (Engline Segment Detection), ''sted'' (Sub-pixel Text Detection and Hints), or ''box'' (Output as bounding boxes). This option helps customize the output to suit specific applications and requirements.'
        print-parameters: '[AI] `tesseract --print-parameters` is a command-line option for the Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine. This option displays all the parameters and their corresponding values that will be used during an OCR recognition process, before the actual recognition takes place. It can help users understand the configuration of the OCR engine for a specific task and troubleshoot issues related to parameter settings.'
        psm: '[AI] The `--psm` option in Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software is used to specify page segmentation modes. Page segmentation is the process of identifying and separating regions on an image that correspond to text lines or blocks. Different page segmentation modes can be selected based on the type of image being processed, such as text-only pages, handwriting, or mixed text and images. Commonly used page segmentation modes in Tesseract include single column, single character, and automatic. The choice of mode depends on the input image and desired output format.'
        tessdata-dir: '[AI] `tesseract --tessdata-dir` is a command-line argument used with the Tesseract Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine. The `--tessdata-dir` option specifies the directory containing the training data files (also known as language models or configuration files) required for OCR recognition of specific languages. This argument ensures that Tesseract can locate and use the necessary data files to accurately recognize text from scanned images.'
        user-patterns: '[AI] `tesseract --user-patterns` is a command-line option for the Tesseract Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine. This option enables custom user-defined patterns or dictionaries to assist Tesseract in recognizing specific characters or text sections that might be difficult for it to identify using its standard models alone. These patterns can include custom shapes, text snippets, or even entire images used as templates to guide Tesserack''s recognition process. This functionality helps improve accuracy and efficiency when dealing with complex OCR tasks involving unique fonts, handwriting, or damaged text documents.'
        user-words: '[AI] The `--user-words` option in Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software is used to specify a list of words or characters that should be recognized as single entities, even if they are split across lines or columns in an image. This can be useful for dealing with irregularly shaped text, such as handwriting or complex character arrangements. The option takes a file containing the user-words as input.'
        version: '[AI] `tesseract --version` is a command used in Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software to display the current version information of the installed Tesseract engine. It returns output showing the major, minor, and sometimes the patch version number, along with any additional build or compilation information.'
