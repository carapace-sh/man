documentation:
    command: '[AI] `supervisorctl` is a utility used to control the Supervisor process manager. The `start` command is used to start a specific service or process that is managed by Supervisor. It takes the name of the service as an argument, for example: `supervisorctl start my_service`. This command will start the "my\_service" process if it is currently stopped, and ensure that it remains running. If the service is already running, then this command has no effect.'
