        [AI] The `pulumi plugin` command is used to manage and interact with Pulumi plugins, which are extensions that add new resources or capabilities to the Pulumi platform. Plugins allow users to deploy and manage infrastructure for various cloud providers and services beyond what's included in Pulumi by default.

        The `plugin` command provides several sub-commands:

        1. `install`: Installs a specific plugin using its name or repository URL.
        2. `list`: Lists the currently installed plugins with their versions.
        3. `rm`: Uninstalls a specific plugin by name.
        4. `config`: Manages plugin configuration settings.

        Using these sub-commands, you can manage your Pulumi plugins to expand the range of infrastructure you can deploy and manage with Pulumi.
