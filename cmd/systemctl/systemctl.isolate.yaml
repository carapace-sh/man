documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl isolate` is a command used in systemd-based Linux distributions to put a system into an isolated mode by disabling all but the most essential services. This can be useful for securing or troubleshooting a system, as it minimizes the number of running services and reduces attack surface area. The syntax is `systemctl isolate <target>`, where `<target>` can be a predefined target like "multi-user.target" (the default runlevel) or a custom unit name. Once an isolation mode is active, only the specified target''s services will be running. To return to the normal state, use `systemctl isolate --allow-reboot <normal-state>`.'
