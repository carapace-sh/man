documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git notes append` is a Git command used to append new content to an existing note in a Git repository. The command takes two arguments: the first argument specifies the commit or tree object to which the note is attached, and the second argument is the content to be appended to the note. For example, `git notes append <commit-or-tree> <content>`. This command does not create a new note; it only adds additional information to an existing one.'
    flag:
        allow-empty: '[AI] `git notes append --allow-empty` is a Git command used to add or append a note to an existing note in a commit with an empty message if desired. The `--allow-empty` option permits adding an empty note, which can be useful when creating a placeholder for future notes without having to modify the existing one. It appends the new note content to the existing note, and the entire combined note becomes part of the commit history.'
        file: '[AI] `git notes append --file` is a Git command used to append new content to an existing note attached to a commit. The `--file` option specifies the path to a file containing the new content to be appended. This command modifies the existing note without creating a new one, making it useful for adding incremental updates or additional information to previously added notes.'
        message: '[AI] The `git notes append` command with the `--message` option allows you to append a new note or comment to an existing git note associated with a commit or a tree object. The new note is added along with the specified message. For example, `git notes append <object> --message="<new note message>"`. This command does not create a new note; instead, it appends the new content to the existing one.'
        reedit-message: '[AI] `git notes append` is a Git command used to add or append a note to an existing annotated tag or a commit. The `-- Reedit-message` option allows you to provide a new message for the note, which will be appended to any existing note text. So, in summary, this command appends a new note with an optional message to an existing Git tag or commit.'
        reuse-message: '[AI] `git notes append` is a Git command used to add a new note to an existing noted commit. The `--reuse-message` option allows you to reuse the message of the most recent note when creating a new one, making it quicker and more convenient to add multiple related notes to a commit without having to type out the entire message each time.'
