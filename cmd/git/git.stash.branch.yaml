description: create and check out a new branch with the stashes changes
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `git stash save <branch-name>` command is used to stash changes on a current branch and create a new branch. This means that any uncommitted changes in your working directory or staging area will be saved away (stashed) and then you can switch to a different branch without losing those changes. The `<branch-name>` is the name of the new branch that will be created once you''ve stashed your current changes. This command is helpful when you want to work on a new feature or fix, but don''t want to commit those changes yet. It keeps your working environment clean while preserving the uncommitted changes for later use.'
