    command: '[AI] `tmux new-window` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to create a new window within an existing TMUX session. When you run this command in your terminal, a new window will be opened with an empty shell session by default. You can then attach processes or commands to this new window using redirection or other methods. This command is useful for splitting your terminal into multiple windows, each running separate tasks or processes.'
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `tmux new-window` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to create a new window within an existing Tmux session. The `-F` option stands for "force-fake-bp" and is used to create a new window with an empty bar (status) at the bottom, even if there''s no pane in it. By default, Tmux would display an error message if trying to create a window without a pane. With `-F`, you can create a blank window.'
        P: '[AI] `tmux new-window -P` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to create a new window with sessions arranged horizontally from left to right, in the order they were created. The `-P` flag stands for "previous" and indicates the ordering of the windows based on their creation time, oldest first. This can be useful when managing multiple windows with a consistent layout.'
        S: '[AI] `tmux new-window` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to create a new window. The `-S` option stands for `-s`, short for session name. It allows you to specify a name for the new session, making it easier to identify and switch between multiple sessions. So, `tmux new-window -S <session-name>` creates a new window with the given session name.'
        a: '[AI] `tmux new-window -a` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to create a new window alongside an existing one. The `-a` (attached) option means that the new window will be attached to the current terminal session, allowing you to view and switch between both windows using Tmux keybindings or the `tmux list-windows` command. This command creates a new pane within the new window, ready for you to run commands or open files in it.'
        b: '[AI] `tmux new-window -b` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. It creates a new window in the current Tmux session, and by using the `-b` (short for "bottom") option, it sets the new window to be displayed at the bottom of the terminal screen when there are other windows above it. This can be useful for keeping an eye on multiple processes or tasks while focusing on others in the upper windows.'
        c: '[AI] `tmux new-window -c` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to create a new window and immediately enter or attach to it. The `-c` option specifies the command to run in the newly created window upon its creation, effectively starting a new shell session there. It''s useful for quickly opening multiple sessions with different commands or projects.'
        d: '[AI] `tmux new-window -d` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to create a new window in the background. The `-d` option stands for "detached," which means that the session will run in the background and won''t attach to your terminal. After creating the new window, tmux returns its PID (Process ID), allowing you to manage it later using other Tmux commands.'
        e: '[AI] `tmux new-window -e` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to create a new window and open a specified shell command or program within that window. The `-e` flag stands for "new-session -c", which means creating a new window inside an existing Tmux session with the given command as its initial process. So, running `tmux new-window -e "bash myscript.sh"` will open a new window and execute the script "myscript.sh" in that window within the current Tmux session.'
        k: '[AI] `tmux new-window` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. The `-k` option is not part of this command, but rather an argument for key binding. Without `-k`, `new-window` creates a new window in the current TMUX session. With `-k <key>`, you define a key binding to create a new window when that specific key is pressed within the TMUX environment. For instance, `tmux new-window -K C-b w` sets the combination `Ctrl+b w` as a shortcut for creating a new window.'
        "n": '[AI] `tmux new-window` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that creates a new window within an existing Tmux session. The `-n` option specifies a name for the new window, which helps you identify and manage it more easily when working with multiple windows in your session. So, `tmux new-window -n <name>` will create a new window with the given name.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux new-window` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer that creates a new window within an existing tmux session. The `-t` option allows you to name or target an existing window group or window, so `tmux new-window -t <name>` will create a new window and attach it to the specified window group or named window.'
