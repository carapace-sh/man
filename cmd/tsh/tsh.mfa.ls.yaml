    command: '[AI] The `tsh mfa ls` command is used in the Tenable Security Center''s Tenable Security Hill (TSH) terminal to list Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) policies configured on your account or within an organization. It returns a table containing the policy names, IDs, and statuses.'
    flag:
        format: '[AI] The `tsh` command with the argument `mfa ls --format` is a command from the Tmux pane and window manager. It''s used to list Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) information for the current session. The `--format` option determines how the output will be formatted. Specifically, it requests the output to be in a customizable format, allowing users to extract specific parts of the information as needed. For example, you could ask for just the token or challenge string with the appropriate format specifiers.'
        no-verbose: '[AI] `tsh` is a command-line tool for using Tarantula, a database query and monitoring system. The given command, `tsh mfa ls --no-verbose`, is used to list master and replica databases under a specific project in Tarantula, but with the `--no-verbose` option it is run in quiet mode, meaning only necessary output will be displayed without any additional details or explanations.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] `tsh` is likely a reference to the Taylor Shell expansion (or Tesh) command-line tool, which is part of the GNU Bash shell. The given command, `tsh mfa ls --verbose`, can be broken down as follows:

            1. `tsh`: Invokes the Tesh command-line tool.
            2. `mfa`: Stands for "most recently used files and directories," which is a feature of the Tesh tool that displays a list of recently accessed files and directories.
            3. `ls`: Is a Unix/Linux command used to list the contents of a directory. Here, it's likely being used in conjunction with `tsh mfa` to display the details (or "verbose" output) of the most recently used files or directories.
            4. `--verbose`: Is an option that requests detailed information when running a command. In this context, it instructs `ls` to display additional file attributes like permissions, size, and timestamps.

            So, the overall command, `tsh mfa ls --verbose`, lists and displays verbosely (with additional details) the most recently used files or directories.
