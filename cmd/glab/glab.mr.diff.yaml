    command: '[AI] `glab mr diff` is a GitLab CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to show the difference between two branches or merge requests in GitLab. It fetches the differences as patches, which can be reviewed and applied locally before merging changes into the main branch. This command helps developers to understand the proposed modifications without accessing the GitLab web interface directly.'

            [AI] `git diff` is a Git command used to show the differences between two commits or branches. The option `--color` enables colored output for easy visualization of changes in the text. The `glab` tool is an alternative Git interface that provides additional features and aliases, including the `mr` (merge request) command.

            When using `glab mr diff --color`, Git fetchers the differences between two branches or commits, applying the `--color` flag to display the results with colored text for better readability. It's commonly used in merge requests workflows to review changes easily within a terminal environment.
