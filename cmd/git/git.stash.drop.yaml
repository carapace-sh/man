    -q, --quiet: suppress feedback messages
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git stash drop` is a Git command used to remove and apply the most recent stashed change stack (stash). In other words, it applies the last stash and then permanently removes it from the stash list. If there are multiple stashes, this command only affects the last one.'
    flag:
        quiet: '[AI] `git stash drop --quiet` is a Git command used to apply and remove the most recent stashed change stack. The `--quiet` option suppresses informational messages during the execution of this command. When you run this command, Git will apply the changes from the most recent stash and then remove it without any confirmation or output message except for errors. This command is useful when you want to get rid of a specific stash and apply its changes in the background without any distractions from additional messages.'
