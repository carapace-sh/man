        [AI] `nmcli` is a NetworkManager command-line utility used to manage network connections in Linux systems. The `connection clone` command is used to create a new network connection based on an existing one, with some modifications if desired. Here's a brief explanation:

        1. Syntax: `nmcli connection clone <CONNECTION_NAME> <NEW_CONNECTION_NAME>`
        2. The first argument `<CONNECTION_NAME>` is the name of the current connection you want to clone.
        3. The second argument `<NEW_CONNECTION_NAME>` specifies the new name for the cloned connection.
        4. By default, the cloning process creates an identical copy of the existing connection with the same configuration. However, you can modify specific settings using options such as IP addresses, gateways, or DNS servers by providing additional arguments in the command. For example: `nmcli connection clone <CONNECTION_NAME> <NEW_CONNECTION_NAME> --set type <connection-type> --set ip4.addresses "<IPv4_ADDRESS>" --set ip4.gateway "<GATEWAY>"`.
        5. Once executed, the new connection with the specified modifications is added to your system's NetworkManager configuration. You can then enable or modify it as needed using other `nmcli` commands.

        temporary: '[AI] `nmcli` is a networking management command-line tool for Linux systems, including NetworkManager. The `connection clone` command creates a new network connection configuration based on an existing one. The `--temporary` option creates a transient or temporary connection profile. This means the connection will not be saved after reboot and will only persist for the current session. Therefore, it is useful when you want to quickly create a network connection without making permanent changes to your system''s configuration.'
