description: Create an ExternalName service
flags:
    --allow-missing-template-keys: If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
    --dry-run?: Must be "none", "server", or "client". If client strategy, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it. If server strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the resource.
    --external-name!=: External name of service
    --field-manager=: Name of the manager used to track field ownership.
    --save-config: If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. Otherwise, the annotation will be unchanged. This flag is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.
    --show-managed-fields: If true, keep the managedFields when printing objects in JSON or YAML format.
    --tcp*=: Port pairs can be specified as '<port>:<targetPort>'.
    --template=: Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
    --validate?: Validation mode.
    -o, --output=: 'Output format. One of: (json, yaml, name, go-template, go-template-file, template, templatefile, jsonpath, jsonpath-as-json, jsonpath-file).'
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubectl create service externalname` command is used to create a Kubernetes Service of type `ExternalName`. This type of Service does not provide any traffic loading or load balancing functionality. Instead, it creates an alias for an external DNS name. When a pod refers to the created Service by name, the Service will resolve to the specified external DNS name, allowing the pod to access services outside of the Kubernetes cluster using that name.'
    flag:
        allow-missing-template-keys: '[AI] The `kubectl create service externalname` command creates a Kubernetes Service of type ExternalName. This Service connects to an external DNS name, typically a service running outside the cluster. The `--allow-missing-template-keys` flag is used when creating a YAML manifest file for this Service using the `kubectl expose deploy` or similar commands that expect a fully defined template. With this flag enabled, Kubernetes will still create the Service even if some required keys are missing from the template. This can be useful in complex scenarios where not all pieces of the application may be ready at the time of creation, but you still want to create the core infrastructure components as soon as possible.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `kubectl create service externalname` is a command used with the Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) to create an ExternalName service type in a Kubernetes cluster. This service type acts as an alias for another DNS name and allows accessing services outside the cluster using their external hostnames. The `--dry-run` flag is optional and it only prints out what would be created without actually executing the command. It provides a way to preview the changes before applying them, which can help avoid mistakes and ensure that the desired configuration will be applied correctly when the command is run without the flag.'
        external-name: '[AI] The `kubectl create service externalname` command creates a Kubernetes Service of type `ExternalName`. This Service does not manage traffic to pods within a cluster, but instead creates an alias for an existing DNS name. The `--external-name` flag specifies the target hostname or FQDN for this alias. When a client queries the IP address for the Service''s name, it will be resolved to the IP associated with the external-named target. This configuration can be useful when you want to expose an existing service outside of your cluster using its native DNS name.'
        field-manager: |-
            [AI] The `kubectl create service externalname` command is used to create a Kubernetes Service of type ExternalName. This service type does not run a proxy like ClusterIP or NodePort services, but instead creates an alias for another DNS record.

            The `--field-manager` flag is an optional argument that can be passed when creating or updating Kubernetes objects using the `kubectl` command-line tool. It allows users to specify a custom StrategicMergeFieldManager to manage merge conflicts between the desired state and the actual state of the cluster.

            When merging changes, `--field-manager` ensures that only the specified fields are updated or created, and leaves other fields untouched, reducing the risk of unintended side effects. It is particularly useful in complex Kubernetes deployments where multiple teams might be making changes concurrently, and you want to ensure that your changes do not overwrite others' unintentionally.

            In summary, `kubectl create service externalname --field-manager` creates a Kubernetes ExternalName Service and applies the specified field manager for conflict resolution during updates.
        output: '[AI] The `kubectl create service externalname` command creates a Kubernetes Service of type ExternalName. An ExternalName Service is used to map a Kubernetes service name to an external DNS record. When you access the service using its Kubernetes DNS label `<service-name>.<namespace>._external:<port>`, it automatically resolves the external DNS record associated with that label. The `--output` flag specifies the output format for the command, typically in YAML or JSON format to save or further process the result.'
        save-config: '[AI] `kubectl create service externalname` is a command used in Kubernetes to create an ExternalName service type. An ExternalName service creates an alias to another name, typically the DNS label of an external service not running within the Kubernetes cluster. The `--save-config` flag saves the resulting Kubernetes configuration as a file instead of applying it directly to the cluster. This can be useful for reviewing or using the output in scripts or other processes.'
        show-managed-fields: |-
            [AI] `kubectl create service externalname` is a command used in Kubernetes to create an ExternalName service type. An ExternalName service provides an alias for the hostname of another service not running in the same cluster, but accessible via a CNAME record.

            The `--show-managed-fields` flag is an optional argument that, when provided, causes kubectl to display the managed fields of the created resource. Managed fields are those fields in the YAML manifest file that were changed by Kubernetes as a result of applying the manifest. By showing these fields, users can understand what modifications were made automatically by Kubernetes and ensure their desired configuration remains consistent.
        tcp: |-
            [AI] The `kubectl create service externalname` command creates a Kubernetes Service of type ExternalName. An ExternalName Service is a special type of Kubernetes Service that provides an alias to another DNS name, typically an external service.

            The `--tcp` flag specifies that the service will use TCP protocol for communication between the cluster and the external service. The ExternalName Service does not run any pods or manage traffic; instead, it only creates a stable DNS label that clients in the cluster can use to access the external service using its TCP ports defined in the `kubectl create` command.
        template: '[AI] `kubectl create service externalname` is a command used in Kubernetes to create an ExternalName service type. An ExternalName service acts as an alias for the DNS name of another service, typically located outside of the Kubernetes cluster. The `--template` flag is an optional argument that allows using a template file to generate the YAML manifest for the service. In this way, you can define complex externalname services with custom properties using templates instead of manually writing YAML files.'
        validate: '[AI] `kubectl create service externalname` is a command used with the Kubernetes command-line interface (CLI) tool to create an ExternalName service type. An ExternalName creates an alias for the given DNS name, allowing services in a Kubernetes cluster to refer to it using a stable, local DNS label. The `--validate` flag is optional and when used, it validates the YAML manifest file or configuration against the Kubernetes schema without actually creating any resources. It''s useful for ensuring the correctness of the configuration before applying it in the cluster.'
