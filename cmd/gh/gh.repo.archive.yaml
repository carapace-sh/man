    command: '[AI] `gh repo archive` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create an archive of a GitHub repository as a tarball or zip file. This command downloads the entire repository, including its history and all branches and tags, and saves it into a single file for easy backup or distribution. The archive can be saved locally or piped directly to another command for further processing. The basic usage is `gh repo archive REPO_OWNER/REPO_NAME > ARCHIVE_FILE.tar.gz` or `gh repo archive REPO_OWNER/REPO_NAME --output ZIP_ARCHIVE.zip`.'
    flag:
        confirm: '[AI] `git hub repo archive --confirm` is a GitHub CLI command to create an archive of a repository as a zip or tarball file, and then confirm before downloading it locally. The "--confirm" option ensures that the user intentionally runs the command and isn''t accidentally executing it with incorrect arguments or in the wrong context. This helps prevent unintended actions.'
        "yes": '[AI] `gh repo archive --yes` is a GitHub CLI (gh) command used to create an archive of a repository in the current directory as a tarball or zipfile. The `--yes` option accepts user confirmation implicitly, meaning it bypasses prompting for confirmation before creating and downloading the archive.'
