    command: '[AI] `circleci orb create` is a Command Line Interface (CLI) command used in CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform. This command creates a new CircleCI Orb, which is an extension package that contains reusable CircleCI workflows and configurations. The command takes as arguments the name of the orb, its version number, and an optional description and repository URL for the orb. When executed, it initializes a new Git repository with the specified name and structure for an Orb, including a `config.yml` file and a `.circleci` directory. The newly created orb can then be shared and used by other CircleCI projects.'
