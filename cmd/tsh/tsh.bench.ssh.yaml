documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tsh bench ssh` command is a part of the Tiny Shell (tsh) benchmarking tool in Tsung, an open-source load testing framework. This specific command is used to execute an SSH benchmark test. It measures and evaluates the performance of handling multiple concurrent SSH connections to a target server within a given time frame. The results are usually displayed as throughput (number of connections per second) or response times, helping to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize the system.'
    flag:
        no-random: '[AI] The command `tsh bench ssh --no-random` is used with the Tsung load testing tool for generating SSH (Secure Shell) traffic. The `--no-random` option disables the use of random delays in Tsung''s SSH scripts, resulting in a more consistent test execution with a fixed delay between each command or packet. This can be useful when you want to ensure that the same actions are performed at the exact same intervals during each test run.'
        port: |-
            [AI] `tsh` is a command-line tool for using the Tsung load testing framework. The specific command you provided, `tsh bench ssh --port`, can be broken down as follows:

            1. `tsh`: This is the name of the Tsung Sharing Hub (TSH) utility, which is used to manage and control Tsung tests from the command line.
            2. `bench`: This is a subcommand within TSH that is used to run load tests with predefined configurations. It automates the process of starting and stopping Tsung clients to achieve a stable and consistent test run.
            3. `ssh`: This is a specific testing profile or plugin for TSH, which is used to simulate SSH (Secure Shell) protocol-based traffic in load tests. In this context, it signifies that the test will be focusing on SSH connections.
            4. `--port`: This option is provided with the `ssh` testing profile and specifies the target SSH server's port number. The flag value following `--port` indicates the actual port number to use in the test.
        random: |-
            [AI] The command `tsh bench ssh --random` is a part of Tsung, an open-source load testing tool for Apache HTTP and other servers. This specific command is used to perform SSH benchmarking tests with random clients.

            In this command, `bench` is the Tsung benchmarking component, which is used to measure the performance of various operations. `ssh` indicates that the operation being measured is Secure Shell (SSH) connectivity. `--random` means that the tool will select random client IP addresses and other parameters for each test run, which helps simulate real-world traffic patterns more effectively.
