    -h, --help: Prints help information
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `rustup target add` is a Rust package manager command used to add support for building Rust projects for a specific target triple. A target triple defines the architecture and operating system for which code is being built (e.g., x86_64-pc-windows-msvc). By adding a new target with `rustup target add`, Rust tools like `rustc` and `cargo` will be able to build and run your Rust projects for that specific architecture and OS.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `rustup target add --help` is a Rust command used to install or switch between Rust compilation targets, specifically adding a new target. The `--help` flag displays detailed information about how to use this command effectively. It shows the available options, including the required `<target>` argument for specifying the name of the new target to be added, and any optional flags that can influence the installation process. For instance, you can specify a toolchain or component to install alongside the target. Overall, it''s an essential command when managing your Rust development environment with Rustup.'
        toolchain: '[AI] `rustup target add --toolchain` is a Rust command used to install or switch to a specific toolchain for a particular Rust target (e.g., x86\_64-pc-windows-msvc). The `--toolchain` option specifies the name or hash of the desired toolchain, and `target add` instructs Rustup to manage the installation of that target and associated toolchain for use in your Rust projects.'
