    command: '[AI] `gh extension` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to manage and install extensions for the GitHub desktop and command-line applications. Extensions can add new features, improve workflows, or customize the user experience. To install an extension using this command, you would provide its name as an argument, for example: `gh extension install <extension-name>`. For a list of available extensions, use `gh extension lists`. To update existing extensions, use `gh extension update` instead.'
