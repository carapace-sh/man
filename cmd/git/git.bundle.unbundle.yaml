documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git bundle unbundle` is a Git command used to extract branches or commits from a bundled Git repository, which is a lightweight archive that can be shared over a read-only medium like an HTTP server or sent via email. The extracted data can then be imported into a new local Git repository using the `git import` command. This operation creates a new working directory and sets up the newly imported branches to be ready for checking out and further development.'
