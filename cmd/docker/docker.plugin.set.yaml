        [AI] `docker plugin set` is a Docker CLI command used to manage plugins installed in a Docker host. It allows you to list, install, update, and remove plugins from your Docker environment. The syntax is as follows:

        ```bash
        docker plugin [<command>] [<options>]

        commands:
          set:        Manage plugins, e.g., list, install, update or remove them

        options:
          --help     Show this help message and exit
          PLUGIN     Name or ID of the plugin to manage
        ```

        For example, you can use `docker plugin set install <plugin-name>` to install a new plugin or `docker plugin set update <plugin-name>` to update an existing one. The specific command and options depend on your use case. For a comprehensive list of available commands and options, you can refer to the Docker documentation or run `docker plugin help set`.
