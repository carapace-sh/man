        [AI] `dagger login` is a command used in Dagger, an open-source toolkit built for building container images and managing Kubernetes clusters. This command helps you authenticate with a remote registry or cluster manager, enabling you to push and pull Docker images using the provided Dagger CLI context.

        When running `dagger login`, you'll typically provide either a registry URL or a Kubernetes cluster configuration file, followed by authentication credentials like a token or username/password. The command establishes a secure connection between your local environment and the remote service for future interactions with Dagger commands such as building, pushing, or deploying container images.
