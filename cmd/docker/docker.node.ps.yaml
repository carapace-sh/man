description: List tasks running on one or more nodes, defaults to current node
flags:
    --format=: Pretty-print tasks using a Go template
    --no-resolve: Do not map IDs to Names
    --no-trunc: Do not truncate output
    -f, --filter=: Filter output based on conditions provided
    -q, --quiet: Only display task IDs
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker node ps` command is used to display the containers running on a specific Docker Swarm node. This command helps you check the status of containers in a Swarm mode cluster, including their names, images, and running status. It takes no arguments by default and filters the output based on the node where it''s executed.'
    flag:
        filter: '[AI] `docker node ps --filter` is a command used in Docker Swarm mode to filter and display tasks running on specific nodes based on certain labels or constraints. The `--filter` option allows specifying filters in the format "key=value" or using predefined filters like `node.id==<ID>` or `label key=value`. This command helps manage and monitor containerized applications deployed across a Docker Swarm cluster.'
        format: '[AI] `docker node ps --format` is a command used in Docker Swarm mode to filter and format the output of the `ps` subcommand, which lists running services and their associated nodes. The `--format` flag allows specifying custom output templates using Go text template syntax. This can be useful for extracting specific information from the output for further processing or analysis.'
        no-resolve: '[AI] The `docker node ps --no-resolve` command is used to list the running containers in a Swarm mode cluster, without resolving their IP addresses to their respective nodes. The `--no-resolve` flag prevents Docker from displaying the container''s assigned node and IP address, focusing only on the container name, ID, and status. This can be useful when working with large clusters or when debugging container issues without needing to identify the specific node where a container is running.'
        no-trunc: '[AI] The `docker node ps --no-trunc` command is used to list all containers running in a Docker Swarm or Docker in a swarm mode cluster. The `--no-trunc` flag prevents the output from being truncated, meaning that you will see the full container names and labels instead of just their abbreviated forms. The output includes the container ID, image, status, ports, and other relevant information.'
        quiet: '[AI] `docker node ps --quiet` is a command used in Docker Swarm mode to list the running tasks in a swarm cluster with minimal output. The `--quiet` flag reduces the output to just the task IDs, making it suitable for scripts or automated processes that do not require additional information.'
