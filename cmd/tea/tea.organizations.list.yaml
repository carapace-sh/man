documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea organizations list` command is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It seems to be specific to the TEA (Trade and Economic Applications) software system. This command is used to display a list of organizations that are set up in the TEA system. Organizations can represent companies, institutions, or other entities involved in international trade transactions. The exact format and output of this command may vary depending on the specific configuration of the TEA system.'
    flag:
        limit: '[AI] The `--limit` option in the `tea organizations list` command is used to specify the maximum number of organizations to be displayed in the output. By default, this command lists all the organizations available. However, you can use `--limit` followed by a number to limit the number of organizations returned. For instance, `tea organizations list --limit 10` would display only the first 10 organizations in the list.'
        login: '[AI] The command `tea organizations list --login` is used in the TeaDB database management tool for Ethereum blockchain data. This command lists out all the organizations that have registered their accounts with TeaDB, allowing users to log in using their organization''s credentials for accessing and managing data related to that organization. The `--login` flag specifically indicates that the output should only display information necessary for logging into TeaDB with an organization account.'
        output: '[AI] `tea organizations list --output` is a command used in the Assam Tea Industry System (ATIS) or similar systems to generate a list of tea organizations. The `--output` flag specifies the output format, typically CSV or JSON, for easy data import and processing into other applications.'
        page: '[AI] The `--page` option in the `tea organizations list` command is used to specify a particular page of results when listing tea organizations using a tool or API that supports pagination. This allows users to retrieve smaller chunks of data at a time, reducing the amount of data transferred and improving performance for large lists. The exact format and usage may vary depending on the specific tool or API being used.'
        remote: '[AI] The `--remote` option in the `tea organizations list` command is used with the TeaDB tool in the Teapot library for the Ethereum blockchain. This option specifies that the command should fetch the list of tea organizations (or any other list) from a remote node or archive in the Ethereum network instead of querying the local one. It enhances the command''s functionality by allowing users to access information from other nodes and expand their perspective on the blockchain state.'
        repo: '[AI] The `tea organizations list --repo` command is used with the TeaSQL database management system''s TeaCLI tool. This command specifically lists all the repositories (i.e., databases) that are currently registered in the TeaSQL system. It provides a concise output showing the name and URL of each repository, helping users manage their databases efficiently.'
