    command: '[AI] `tmux list-keys` is a TMUX command that displays a list of key bindings for the current terminal multiplexer session or for a specific window or pane. It can help users understand and customize their TMUX setup by showing the keys currently assigned to various actions within the application. The output is usually in a tabular format, listing the keys followed by the corresponding commands they trigger.'
    flag:
        "1": '[AI] `tmux list-keys` is a TMUX command used to display a list of key bindings for the current or specified session or window. The `-1` option is used to output only the binding for the first matched key. So, the overall command `tmux list-keys -1` returns the binding for the first occurrence of a specific key in the TMUX configuration.'
        "N": '[AI] `tmux list-keys` is a Tmux command used to display a list of key bindings for the current session or for specific windows and panes. The `-N` option stands for "no-names," meaning that only the keys and their associated actions will be displayed, without the names of the windows, panes, or modes. In summary, `tmux list-keys -N` prints a raw list of key bindings without additional context information.'
        P: '[AI] `tmux list-keys -P` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer that displays a list of key bindings for the current session or window. The `-P` option makes the output plain text, meaning it''s easily parsed by scripts or other applications. Each line in the output represents a binding, showing the key sequence and the corresponding command or target window/pane.'
        T: '[AI] `tmux list-keys` is a tmux command that displays a list of key bindings for the current session or window. The `-T` option is used to display the target window or pane identifier along with each binding. So, `tmux list-keys -T` will output a table showing the keys and their corresponding targets.'
        a: '[AI] `tmux list-keys -a` is a tmux command that lists all key bindings defined in the current and all attached sessions. The `-a` option makes it show the bindings for all the windows and panes as well, not just the one the command was run from. It displays the keys, the actions associated with them, and the session or window context if relevant. This can be useful for understanding and managing complex keybindings in tmux environments.'
