    command: '[AI] The `go tool dist` command is used in Go programming language to download and manage the distribution of Go binaries for different operating systems and architectures. It is typically invoked with the `env` subcommand, which displays the list of available Go versions and their corresponding file paths. This command helps developers maintain multiple Go versions on their system and easily switch between them for project-specific requirements.'
    flag:
        "9": '[AI] `go-tool-dist env -9` is a command using the Go programming language''s `govbuild` tool (also known as "go dist"). The `env` flag with argument "-9" specifies that it should output environment variables for building Go projects in ninja builder mode, which is a fast and efficient build system supported by Go. These environment variables can be used to configure the build process when running outside of the Go IDE or when automating builds.'
        p: '[AI] `go-tool-dist env -p` is a command using the Go tool''s distribution management system, specifically the "env" subcommand. This command displays the active Go environment variables, which define the location of the Go installation and its corresponding GOOS and GOTOS environment variables for cross-compiling. The `-p` flag makes the output more succinct by only printing the variable names and values without any additional prefixes or suffixes.'
        v: '[AI] `go-tool-dist env -v` is a command used in Go programming language to display environment variables that are relevant to the Go toolchain, such as GOPATH and GOOS. The `go-tool-dist` is the distribution tool in Go, which manages downloading and installing packages, and the `env` subcommand displays environment variables. The `-v` flag increases the verbosity of output, providing more detailed information about the environment variables being displayed.'
        w: '[AI] The `go-tool-dist env -w` command is a Go programming language tool used to set or update the GOENV environment variables, which control the Go version used by the go command in a project. The `-w` flag stands for "write" and indicates that the changes should be persistently saved in the operating system''s environment. When you run this command followed by the desired GOVERSION (e.g., "1.16"), it sets or updates the GOENV variables to use that specific Go version for the current project.'
