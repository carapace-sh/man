documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nix-profile remove` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems, to remove installed profiles. Profiles are collections of packages and their configurations managed by Nix. By specifying the name of a profile, this command will uninstall it, including all installed packages within that profile and their configurations, freeing up system resources.'
    flag:
        arg: |-
            [AI] The `nix-profile` is a tool in Nix Package Manager used to manage user configurations and install packages. The command `nix-profile remove --arg` is used to remove a specific package or configuration with the given argument.

            The `remove` action removes the specified profile or package from the system. The `--arg` option is used to provide an argument to filter which profile or package to remove based on its name or other attributes. For example, `nix-profile remove mypackage --arg 'name mypackage' will remove the package named "mypackage" from the system.
        argstr: '[AI] `nix-profile` is a utility in Nix Package Manager used to manage user configurations and environments. The command `nix-profile remove --argstr="<key>=<value>"` removes a specific configuration or environment with the given key-value pair from the current profile. For instance, `nix-profile remove --argstr="haskellPackages myPackage"`, would delete the installation of "myPackage" for Haskell packages in the current Nix profile.'
        debug: '[AI] `nix-profile remove --debug` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command removes a previously installed Nix profile, which is a collection of packages and configurations managed by Nix. The `--debug` flag enables debug output during the removal process, providing more detailed information about what files are being removed and any errors that may occur.'
        debugger: '[AI] The `nix-profile` is a tool in Nix packaging system used to manage user environments. The command `nix-profile remove --debugger` is used to remove the Nix expression for installing and managing debuggers from the current profile. This means that any debuggers installed through this Nix expression will no longer be managed by Nix, allowing the user to manually manage them instead. This command does not uninstall or remove the debuggers themselves but only changes how they are managed.'
        eval-store: '[AI] `nix-profile remove --eval-store` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command removes named evaluations from the Nix expression language''s built-in store. Evaluations are named configurations that can be used to customize how packages are installed or configured. By removing an evaluation, any customizations associated with it will no longer apply when installing or upgrading packages. This command does not remove actual installed packages but only affects the Nix expression language evaluations.'
        impure: '[AI] The `nix-profile remove` command with the `--impure` option is used to remove a specific package or configuration from a Nix profile without affecting the dependencies of other packages. This allows for fine-grained customization and management of installed software in a Nix environment. When you run this command, Nix will only remove the specified package or configuration and leave the rest of the installed packages intact.'
        include: |-
            [AI] `nix-profile` is a Nix package manager command used to manage system configurations. The `remove` subcommand is used to uninstall or remove specific profiles or configuration components from the system.

            The option `--include` is used in conjunction with `remove` to specify a list of names of the profiles or configuration modules to be removed. For example, `nix-profile remove --include my_profile` will remove the profile named "my\_profile". Multiple profiles can be specified by separating their names with spaces: `nix-profile remove --include my_profile1 my_profile2`.

            In summary, `nix-profile remove --include` is a command used to uninstall one or more Nix profiles by specifying their names using the `--include` option.
        log-format: '[AI] `nix-profile` is a utility in Nix package manager used to manage user profiles, which allow installing and managing software packages separately for different users or environments. The command `nix-profile remove --log-format` isn''t a common usage, but it''s used to remove a specific log format from the Nix logging configuration. This command removes a specified log format (like "json", "human-readable" or "short") from the Nix logging settings, making the Nix daemon only output logs in the remaining formats.'
        override-flake: |-
            [AI] The `nix-profile` command is a part of Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It provides a way to manage user configurations and environments.

            The `remove` subcommand is used to remove a specific profile or an override. The option `--override-flake` specifies that the given override file should be removed, which in turn removes the associated Flake output or build tree. This command does not affect the original source code or configuration files, just the generated outputs.
        print-build-logs: '[AI] `nix-profile remove` is a command in Nix Package Manager used to remove installed profiles and their associated packages. The `--print-build-logs` option is an argument that instructs the command to print the build logs for each removed profile to the standard output instead of deleting them silently. This can be useful for debugging or recording the build history of your Nix profiles.'
        profile: '[AI] The `nix-profile` is a part of Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. The command `nix-profile remove --profile <profile-name>` is used to remove a specific Nix profile from the system. Profiles in Nix are collections of packages and configurations that can be managed separately. By running this command, you''re telling Nix to delete the specified profile and any packages it contains from your system.'
        quiet: '[AI] `nix-profile remove --quiet` is a command in Nix package manager for removing installed profiles quietly. A Nix profile is a collection of packages and their configurations. When you run this command, it removes the specified profile without displaying any messages or progress indicators, making the process run in the background. This can be useful when automating tasks or running scripts where you don''t need to see the output.'
        verbose: '[AI] `nix-profile remove` is a command in Nix Package Manager used to remove a specific Nix profile. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output during the removal process, providing more detailed information about the files and directories being deleted. In essence, it runs the command with more extensive logging for better visibility into the actions taken.'
