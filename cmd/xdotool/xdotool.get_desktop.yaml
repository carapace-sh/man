description: Output the current desktop in view
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `xdotool` is a versatile and powerful tool for automating interaction with X11 applications. The specific command `xdotool get_desktop` doesn''t exist, as this command is meant to retrieve the identifier of a window or widget, not the entire desktop. However, if you intend to get the desktop screen geometry or other related information, you can use `xdotool --list_desktops` instead. This command returns a list with the current desktop number and its associated output of the X11 root window ID. For instance, "Desktop 0: *0x5400011b38b938b8" where ''Desktop 0'' is the name and ''*0x5400011b38b938b8'' is the root window ID.'
