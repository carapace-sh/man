documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pacman-db-upgrade` is a command used in Arch Linux and its derivatives for updating the local Pacman package database indexes. When new package repositories or updates to existing repositories become available, running `pacman-db-upgrade` synchronizes your local Pacman database with the remote repository metadata, allowing you to use `pacman` to install or upgrade packages using the latest information. In summary, it ensures your local Pacman database is up-to-date with package repository changes.'
    flag:
        config: |-
            [AI] The `pacman-db-upgrade --config` command is used in Arch Linux to upgrade the local Pacman database configuration files. Pacman is the package manager for Arch Linux, and its database stores information about installed packages and their dependencies.

            This command reads the configuration options from a file instead of using the default settings. The `--config` option followed by a file path argument allows specifying an alternative configuration file. This can be useful when making system-wide changes or during package upgrades where specific configurations are required.
        dbpath: '[AI] `pacman-db-upgrade` is a command used in Arch Linux to update the local package database without downloading new packages. The option `--dbpath` specifies the path to the directory containing the package database files (both the cache and the sqlite databases). This command will upgrade the database schema and improve indexing for faster package searches.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `pacman-db-upgrade --help` is a command used in Arch Linux for upgrading the Pacman database without actually installing or updating any packages. The `--help` option displays detailed information about this specific command, including its purpose, available options, and usage examples. It's essential for users to understand the possible configurations when using this tool, especially in production environments, to ensure a smooth database upgrade process. Some common options include:

            - `--force` or `-f`: Force upgrades even if packages have dependencies that cannot be satisfied.
            - `--quadratic-algo` or `-q`: Use the quadratic algorithm for dependency resolution instead of the default exponential one. This can lead to longer processing times but may resolve more complex dependency issues.

            Overall, this command is an essential part of maintaining an Arch Linux system by keeping the database up-to-date without unnecessary package installations.
        nocolor: |-
            [AI] The `pacman-db-upgrade --nocolor` command is a Pacman (Package Manager for Arch Linux) command used to upgrade and synchronize the local package database while disabling color output.

            When executed, it performs the following tasks:

            1. Upgrades the local package database by downloading and installing any available package updates.
            2. Synchronizes the local package repository with its remote sources (if configured).
            3. Disables the use of color in the terminal output to make it more readable for users who prefer monochrome or have visual impairments.
        root: '[AI] `pacman-db-upgrade` is a command-line utility used with Arch Linux and other Arch-based distributions to update the local package database. The `--root` option specifies the root directory of the system where the operation should be performed. In simple terms, it upgrades the existing package database located in that specified root directory. This command is typically run as a part of system maintenance or after installing a new Arch Linux distribution to ensure that the local package repository is up-to-date with the latest available packages.'
        version: '[AI] `pacman-db-upgrade --version` is a command used in Arch Linux and its derivatives to check the version of the pacman-db-upgrade utility, which is responsible for upgrading the local package database without downloading new packages. By running this command with no arguments, you''ll see the current version of the utility displayed in the terminal. This information can be helpful when checking if your system has the latest version or not, and when planning to perform an upgrade using this tool.'
