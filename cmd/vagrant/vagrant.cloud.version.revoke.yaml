documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud version revoke` command is used to remove a previously published version of a Vagrantbox (also known as a box) from the Vagrant Cloud registry. This action can be taken when there''s a need to remove an incorrect or outdated version, ensuring that other users don''t unintentionally download and use it. It''s important to note that this command should be used with caution, as revoking a published version may impact other users who rely on that specific version for their projects.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud version revoke --force` command is used to forcefully revoke a previously published Vagrant box version from the Vagrant Cloud repository. This action removes the specified version from public availability, and cannot be undone. It''s typically used when there are security vulnerabilities or other critical issues in a specific box version that should no longer be accessible.'
        no-force: '[AI] `vagrant cloud version revoke --no-force` is a Vagrant command used to revoke a specific version of a box from the Vagrant Cloud repository. The `--no-force` flag is optional and prevents the command from overwriting an existing revision if one already exists for that box version. In other words, it ensures that only the specified version is revoked and no other versions are affected.'
