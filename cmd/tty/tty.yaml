documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tty` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to display the terminal or virtual console device name associated with the standard input, output, and error file descriptors of a process. It simply prints out the path of the controlling terminal for the current shell. For example, `tty` might return something like "/dev/pts/0" or "/dev/tty1".'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `tty` is a command-line utility in Unix and Linux systems used to open and manage terminal sessions. The option `--help` is provided by most Unix commands, including `tty`, to display detailed information about the command''s usage, available options, and their descriptions. In the context of `tty`, using the command with `--help` as an argument will print out a comprehensive help message describing the various ways `tty` can be used to manage terminals.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `tty --quiet` command is a Unix utility used to check if a terminal device is interactive and active. The `--quiet` option makes it return an exit status code: 0 if the device is interactive, or a non-zero value otherwise. It does not produce any output when run with this option. In other words, it tests the condition silently and reports only through its exit status.'
        silent: '[AI] `tty --silent` is a command in Unix-like operating systems that redirects the standard input, output, and error streams of a process to a try device (typically a terminal). The `--silent` option suppresses any informational messages that `tty` might produce during its execution. This can be useful when automating scripts or running processes in the background where unwanted messages may interfere with the desired output.'
        version: '[AI] `tty` is a Unix-like terminal emulator or terminal driver, which manages the connection between a process and a terminal device. The command `tty --version` is used to display the version information of the `tty` utility installed on your system. This includes details such as the release name, version number, and sometimes the operating system it was built for. It provides useful information for troubleshooting or compatibility checks with other software.'
