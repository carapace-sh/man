    command: '[AI] The `restic generate` command is a part of the Restic backup tool. It is used to create a new backup repository from an existing one, by generating a new set of keys and initialization files. This can be useful when setting up a new backup server or rotating keys for security reasons. The generated files should be copied to the new location and used to initialize the new repository.'
    flag:
        bash-completion: '[AI] `restic generate --bash-completion` is a command used with the data backup tool, restic. This command generates script files for integrating restic with the Bash shell as a completion source. The scripts enable more efficient and accurate tab-completion of restic commands and options in the terminal. It enhances user experience by reducing typing errors and making interactions with restic more fluid.'
        fish-completion: '[AI] `restic generate --fish-completion` is a command used with the backup tool called `restic`. This command generates Fish (a Tas-specific shell) completion files for `restic`, allowing autocompletion suggestions to be displayed while typing commands in the Fish shell. The `--fish-completion` flag instructs `restic` to output the completion data in the required format for Fish.'
        man: '[AI] The `restic generate --man` command in `restic`, a backup program, is used to generate or display the manual (manual page or manpage) for the `generate` subcommand. This manpage provides detailed information about how to use the `generate` subcommand to restore specific files or directories from a `restic` backup. It includes usage examples, options, and other relevant details.'
        zsh-completion: '[AI] `restic generate --zsh-completion` is a command used in Restic, a backup program. This specific command generates Zsh completion scripts for Restic. Zsh is a shell, and completion scripts help users to complete commands or file names more quickly by providing suggestions as they type. By running this command, the user can enable autocompletion features specifically tailored for Restic in their Zsh shell.'
