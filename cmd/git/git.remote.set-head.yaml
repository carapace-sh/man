    -a, --auto: set refs/remotes/<name>/HEAD according to remote
    -d, --delete: delete refs/remotes/<name>/HEAD
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git remote set-head` is a Git command used to change the branch that a remote repository is tracking. This command overwrites the current branch with the given branch and sets it as the new head for the specified remote. In other words, it allows you to update which branch on a remote repository Git is following in your local repository.'
    flag:
        auto: '[AI] `git remote set-head` is a Git command used to change the head of a remote branch. The `--auto` option automatically sets the remote branch to match the local branch with the same name, if it exists and is up-to-date. In other words, it helps keep your local and remote branches in sync. This can be useful when working on multiple machines or collaborating with teammates on a project.'
        delete: '[AI] `git remote set-head --delete` is a Git command used to remove the local reference (HEAD) that tracks a specific branch or refspec in a remote repository. When you clone or fetch from a remote, Git creates a local tracking branch for each remote branch you have. This command removes the local tracking reference, effectively breaking the link between your local and remote branches. It does not delete anything from the remote repository itself.'
