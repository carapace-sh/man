    command: '[AI] The `npm run ls` command is not a standalone npm command but rather a script alias defined in an `npm scripts` section of a `package.json` file. When executed, it runs the specified local script listed under "ls" key in the scripts object. This script is typically used for listing files and directories within the project or performing other local tasks. Its functionality depends on what code is defined under the ls script in the package.json file.'
