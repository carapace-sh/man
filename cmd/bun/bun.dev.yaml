documentation:
    command: '[AI] `bun dev` is a command used in BUN (Bundler for Node.js projects), a lightweight and modern bundler for JavaScript projects. It starts a development server with automatic hot-reloading of files, allowing for faster feedback during development. This can be particularly useful when working on frontend or fullstack applications where frequent changes are made to the codebase.'
