documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `xdotool` command is a versatile tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical environment programmatically. The `key` sub-command is used to simulate keyboard input. In simple terms, you can use `xdotool key <key>` to send a specific key event to the focused window. For instance, `xdotool key F5` would send the F5 key event. It''s essential to note that this command should be executed with proper permissions and used responsibly as it can potentially cause unintended consequences if misused.'
    flag:
        clearmodifiers: '[AI] `xdotool key --clearmodifiers` is a command-line tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical environment programmatically. The `--clearmodifiers` option is used to send a key event without any modifier keys (Shift, Control, Alt, or Super) pressed. Thus, it simulates a plain key press without any additional modifier keys. For example, `xdotool key --clearmodifiers v` sends the "v" key event without any modifier keys.'
        delay: '[AI] `xdotool key --delay` is a command used in the xdotool tool to simulate keyboard keys press and release events with a specified delay between them. The delay argument sets the number of milliseconds to wait before sending the next key event. It can be useful for automating keystrokes with a desired timing, such as in scripting or testing applications.'
        window: '[AI] `xdotool` is a versatile tool for interacting with the X11 window system programmatically. The command `xdotool key --window <window_id>` sends a specific keyboard event or keys to the active window identified by `<window_id>`. This can be used to automate tasks such as simulating keystrokes, opening menus with specific keys, or sending custom key combinations. For instance, `xdotool key --window <ID> F12` would send the F12 key event to that window.'
