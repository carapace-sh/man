    command: '[AI] The command "tofu force-unlock" is not a standard Linux or Unix command, as there is no known file system or tool named "tofu" that supports such an operation with this exact name.

    flag:
        force: '[AI] The command `tofu force-unlock -force` is used in the TUF (The Update Framework) security system. It forces the unlocking of a key, bypassing any checks for revocation or expiration. This should be used with caution as it could potentially allow the installation of compromised software if the key being unlocked has been tampered with. It is typically used in emergency situations where there''s no other way to gain access to updates, but trust should be fully verified before using the unlocked keys.'
