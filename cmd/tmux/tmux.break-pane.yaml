    -a: move window to next index after
    -b: move window to next index before

    -t=: specify destination window
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux break-pane` command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, is used to split a pane horizontally or vertically and then detach that new pane from the session. This can be useful when you want to run a separate command or process within a new pane while keeping other panes running in the background. The new pane becomes an independent pane with its own session ID, which is broken off from the original pane.'
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `tmux break-pane` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer, used to split or break a pane within a Tmux window into two separate panes. The `-F` option modifies the appearance of the new pane''s status bar. In essence, this command breaks an existing pane horizontally or vertically and customizes the appearance of the newly created pane''s status bar.'
        P: '[AI] `tmux break-pane -P` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to break a pane (split in the terminal window) into two horizontally or vertically equal parts. The `-P` flag specifies that the split should be performed at the panes'' current position, preserving their relative sizes and positions within the overall layout of the Tmux session.'
        a: '[AI] `tmux break-pane -a` is a command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, used to horizontally split the current pane into two panes. The `-a` flag indicates that this operation should be applied to all selected panes. When executed, each selected pane will be broken at its current position and split into two equal parts, effectively creating two new panes side by side.'
        b: '[AI] `tmux break-pane` is a Tmux command used to split a pane horizontally or vertically, creating new panes. The `-b` option breaks the current pane into before the first pane in the same direction of the split. This results in the current pane being split and the previous pane becoming separate panes. Effectively, it allows you to create two independent panes from one.'
        d: '[AI] The `tmux` command `break-pane -d` is used to detach and delete a pane within a `tmux` session. When you run this command, it detaches the selected pane from the session, and then deletes it permanently. This can be useful if you want to remove a pane that''s no longer needed, or if you accidentally created an extra pane and want to get rid of it. The `-d` flag stands for "detach," indicating that the pane will be detached before being deleted.'
        "n": '[AI] The `tmux` command `break-pane -n` is used to horizontally or vertically split a pane in the Tmux terminal multiplexer application into two or more panes. The `-n` option specifies that a new pane should be created adjacent to an existing one, rather than replacing it. This results in multiple independent panes within the same window. By default, `break-pane` creates a vertical split; to create a horizontal split, use the `-h` option instead.'
        s: '[AI] `tmux break-pane -s` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. It breaks a pane horizontally or vertically into two independent panes, using the specified size for the new pane (implied by the `-s` option). The `-s` flag sets the size of the new pane as a percentage of the original pane''s size. For example, `tmux break-pane -h -s 50` would break the current horizontal pane into two panes with a 50/50 split.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux` command `break-pane -t` is used to detach and split a pane into a new window within the same `tmux` session. The `-t` option specifies the target pane by its identifier or index number. When this command is executed, the selected pane will be detached from its parent window and created as a new independent window. This can be useful for organizing multiple tasks or processes within a single terminal session.'
