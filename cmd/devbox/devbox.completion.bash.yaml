documentation:
    command: '[AI] `devbox completion bash` is a command used with DevBox, a Docker-based development environment tool. It generates completion scripts for Bash shells to facilitate autocomplete functionality for DevBox-related commands when typing in the terminal. This makes using DevBox more efficient and productive by reducing the need to type out long and complex commands manually.'
    flag:
        no-descriptions: '[AI] The command `devbox completion bash --no-descriptions` is used to generate autocompletion suggestions for Bash terminal sessions specifically configured with Devbox, a development environment management tool. The `--no-descriptions` flag instructs the generator not to include descriptions or help messages along with the completions. This can potentially make the autocomplete list more concise and faster to display in the terminal.'
