            [AI] `qmk env --help` is a command used in QMK (Quantum Mechanics Keyboard), an open-source keyboard firmware. This command displays the help information for the `env` subcommand of QMK.

            The `env` subcommand allows users to set and manage various environment variables that control the build and behavior of QMK projects. These variables can include compiler flags, keyboard layouts, and other project-specific configurations.

            When you run `qmk env --help`, it will display a list of all available environment variables, along with their descriptions and default values (if any). It also shows the correct usage for setting and unsetting these variables. This command is useful when you need to configure your QMK project or troubleshoot build issues, as it provides a clear overview of all the available options.
