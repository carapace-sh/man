documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vercel link` is a command used with Vercel CLI (Command Line Interface) to link an existing project or directory to your Vercel account for easy deployment. When you run this command, it generates a new file named `vercel.json` in your project directory and adds necessary configurations to enable continuous deployment from Git. After linking, you can simply commit and push the `vercel.json` file to your repository to start deploying with Vercel.'
