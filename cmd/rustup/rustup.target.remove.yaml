    command: '[AI] `rustup target remove` is a Rust programming language command used to delete a specific target triple from the local Rust toolchain configuration managed by Rustup. It modifies the list of targets that are installed and available for compilation, allowing users to customize their setup according to their project requirements. By specifying a target triple as an argument, this command removes it from the Rustup index, making it no longer accessible for use in rustc builds unless re-added later.'

            [AI] `rustup target remove --help` is a command used in Rust programming language's Rustup tool for removing a specific target triple from the local Rust installation. The `--help` option provides detailed usage information about this command, including:

            - Description: Removes a Rust target from your Rustup install.
            - Usage: `rustup target remove <TARGET>`
            - Flags: None.
            - Arguments:
              - `<TARGET>`: The name or the triple string of the target to be removed.
            - Examples:
              - To remove a target named "i686-pc-windows-msys", run: `rustup target remove i686-pc-windows-msys`.
              - To remove a target with the triple string "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu", run: `rustup target remove x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`.
        toolchain: '[AI] `rustup target remove --toolchain` is a command used in Rust programming language''s Rustup utility. It is used to remove a specific target and its associated toolchain from your Rust installation. The `target` refers to the Rust platform or architecture for which you have installed the toolchain (e.g., x86\_64-pc-windows-msvc), and the `--toolchain` flag specifies that you want to remove the associated toolchain along with the target. This command is useful when you no longer need a particular Rust toolchain setup and wish to save disk space or simplify your Rust development environment.'
