            * `delete <NAME>...`: Delete existing remotes by name.
            * `update`: Update all configured remotes to the latest state.
            * `list`: Show a list of currently configured remotes and their URLs.
            * `get-url <NAME>`: Print the URL of a specific remote.

            This command provides essential information for managing Flatpak repositories, enabling users to add or remove trusted sources for installing applications.
        installation: '[AI] `flatpak remotes --install` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment platform. This command is used to install new remote repositories from which Flatpak applications can be installed or updated. A repository in this context refers to a distribution of packages (applications) that are managed and curated by a specific entity. By running `flatpak remotes --install <remote-name>`, you''re adding a new remote repository to your system, allowing you to install applications from it using the Flatpak client.'
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak remotes --ostree-verbose` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. This command lists the OSTree remote repositories currently configured for Flatpak, displaying detailed information about each repository''s URL, branch, and commit hash. The `--ostree-verbose` flag increases the level of detail provided, making it useful for debugging or managing complex Flatpak environments.'
        show-details: '[AI] `flatpak remotes --show-details` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. This command displays detailed information about the remote repositories that are configured for Flatpapk. A repository is a location where you can find and download Flatpak applications and their dependencies. The output includes the name, URL, authentication method (if any), and other details of each remote repository. It helps users manage and verify the sources of their software installations in Flatpak.'
        show-disabled: '[AI] `flatpak remotes --show-disabled` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. This command displays a list of disabled remote repositories, which are Flatpak sources from where packages can be installed or updated. Disabled remotes are not currently being used for installing or updating applications. To enable a disabled remote, use the `flatpak remote-add` command with the URL of the remote repository.'
        system: '[AI] The `flatpak remotes --system` command is used in Flatpak, a software deployment platform for Linux, to list all the system-wide Flatpak repositories. These repositories are remote servers that store and distribute Flatpak applications and their dependencies. By running this command, you can see the names and URLs of these repositories, which can be useful for troubleshooting or managing your system''s software sources.'
        user: '[AI] `flatpak remotes --user` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux platforms. This command lists the remote repositories that are configured for use with Flatpak''s --user scope. The `--user` flag filters the output to display only those remotes which apply to the current user session. These remotes define the sources from where Flatpak can download and install applications, runtimes, and other components as software packages.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] `flatpak remotes --verbose` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. This command lists the currently configured remote repositories with detailed information.

            The "--verbose" flag increases the output's verbosity, providing more details such as the remote's URL, the GPG key used for authenticating it, the branches or tags, and other metadata. It helps in understanding the exact configuration of each repository and ensures trustworthiness by showing the associated encryption keys.
