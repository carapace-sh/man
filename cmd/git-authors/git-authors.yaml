        [AI] `git authors` is not a valid Git command. It seems like you might be mistaking it for other Git commands such as:

        1. `git log --author <author-name>` which shows commits by a specific author.
        2. `git shortlog` or `git log --short-summary` which lists the authors and number of commits they made in the repository, along with the total number of added and deleted lines for each commit.

            [AI] `git-authors` is a Git command used to list the commit authors and their email addresses for a given set of commits. The `--help` option provides a brief summary of how to use this command:

            ```text
            git authors [<commit>...]: shows an overview of who has committed the given commits.
                    --by-email <email>: only show commits by the given email address.
                    --since <date>: limit results to commits after the given date.
                    --author-name-format <fmt>: customize output format for author names.
            ```

            With `git authors [<commit>...]`, you can provide one or more commit hashes or refs (like a branch name) as arguments, and Git will display information about the commit authors who made those commits.

            Additionally, you can use `--by-email <email>` to filter commits by email address, and `--since <date>` to show only commits made after a specific date. The optional `--author-name-format` argument lets you customize the output format for author names.
        list: '[AI] `git-authors --list` is a Git command that displays a list of all the unique authors and their respective email addresses that have committed to the current repository. The output includes the author name, email address, and the number of commits they have made. This command can be used to identify or check for multiple committers in a project, helping with version control and collaboration management.'
        no-email: '[AI] The `git-authors` command is a Git tool used to list the commit authors and their associated emails, if available. When run with the `--no-email` option (`git-authors --no-email <commit-range>`), it will display only the author names without their corresponding email addresses. The output includes the author name, commit hash, and date for each commit within the specified range.'
