name: watch [SERVICE...]
description: Watch build context for service and rebuild/refresh containers when files are updated
flags:
    --no-up: Do not build & start services before watching
    --quiet: hide build output
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker-compose watch` is a command used with Docker Compose files to monitor for changes in the file and automatically restart services when modifications are detected. It keeps the services running while continuously applying any updates, allowing for real-time development and testing. Essentially, it''s a convenient way to ensure that your containerized application stays in sync with your code changes without manually rebuilding or restarting containers each time you make an update.'
    flag:
        no-up: '[AI] `docker-compose watch --no-up` is a command used with Docker Compose to monitor changes in your application''s source code and automatically restart the containers without starting new ones if any changes are detected. The `--no-up` flag is used to prevent Docker Compose from starting or recreating containers when an error occurs or when the containers are already running. In summary, it enables live reloading of your application while maintaining the current container state.'
        quiet: '[AI] `docker-compose watch --quiet` is a command used with Docker Compose to monitor services for changes and reapply them if necessary, while running in quiet mode which means it will not print any output unless there''s an error or a change has been detected. This can be useful for running the command in the background or as part of a script where you only want to see errors or notifications of changes.'
