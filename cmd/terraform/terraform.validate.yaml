    command: '[AI] `terraform validate` is a Terraform command used to check the syntax and validity of your configuration files against the provider schema. It performs a static analysis of your HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) files, ensuring they conform to the expected structure and format defined by your chosen providers. By running this command before applying changes, you can detect errors or inconsistencies in your configuration and make corrections as needed, helping to prevent potential misconfigurations or unexpected behaviors in your infrastructure deployments.'
    flag:
        json: '[AI] `terraform validate -json` is a command provided by Hashicorp''s Terraform infrastructure configuration tool. This command validates the syntactical correctness and semantic consistency of your Terraform configuration files, without actually applying the changes to your infrastructure. The `-json` flag outputs the validation results in JSON format, which can be further processed or analyzed by other scripts or tools.'
        no-color: '[AI] `terraform validate` is a command in Hashicorp''s Terraform infrastructure as code tool. It checks your configuration files for syntax errors and other issues without making any changes to the actual infrastructure. The `-no-color` flag is an optional argument that disables colored output, making it monochrome. This can be useful when working in environments where colored text isn''t supported or preferred.'
