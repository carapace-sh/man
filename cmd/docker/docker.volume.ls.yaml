description: List volumes
flags:
    --cluster: Display only cluster volumes, and use cluster volume list formatting
    --format=: 'Format output using a custom template:'
    -f, --filter=: Provide filter values (e.g. "dangling=true")
    -q, --quiet: Only display volume names
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker volume ls` command lists all the named volumes created on a Docker host system, along with their size and creation time. It helps in managing and identifying the volumes used by Docker containers. Each line of output displays a volume name, its driver, the size of the data contained within it, and the creation timestamp.'
    flag:
        cluster: '[AI] The `docker volume ls --cluster` command is used to list all Docker volumes across a Docker Swarm cluster. When running this command without any flags, it will only list the volumes on the host machine. However, with the `--cluster` flag, Docker expands its search scope to include all nodes in the swarm and displays a comprehensive list of all volumes defined and replicated across the cluster. This command is helpful for managing and monitoring persistent data storage in a distributed Docker Swarm environment.'
        filter: '[AI] The `docker volume ls --filter` command is used to list all Docker volumes with optional filters. The filter argument `--filter` can be followed by various options to refine the output based on specific criteria such as label, name, or size. For example, `--filter "label=com.mycompany.name==''my-label''"`, will display only the volumes with the specified label name and value. Similarly, `--filter "name = my-volume"`, will show the volume with the given name. Using filters can help in managing and identifying specific volumes among large numbers of Docker volumes.'
        format: '[AI] `docker volume ls --format` is a command used to list all Docker volumes with customized output formatting. The `--format` option allows specifying a Go template to customize the output format of the command. For instance, you can display columns like `Name`, `Driver`, `CreatedAt`, `Mountpoint`, and `Size`. This way, the output becomes more human-readable and easier to process in scripts or automation tools.'
        quiet: '[AI] `docker volume ls --quiet` is a command used in Docker to list all available volumes with minimal output. The `--quiet` flag is used to display only the essential information, including the volume name and its driver. This command is useful when you need to process the output programmatically rather than manually inspecting it.'
