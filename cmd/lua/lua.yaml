documentation:
    command: '[AI] "lua" is a powerful, lightweight, and embeddable scripting language created by LuaProject, Inc., and first released in 1993. It''s known for its simple syntax, small memory footprint, and fast execution speed. The name "lua" means "sky" or "moon" in Portuguese, reflecting the language''s elegant design and ease of use. Lua is commonly used for various purposes such as creating standalone applications, extending other software, or writing scripts for automation tasks. It can be run in a variety of environments, including embedded systems, web servers, games, and desktops.'
    flag:
        E: '[AI] The `-E` option in Lua is used to specify that the script being run is a standalone chunk of Lua code, rather than a file. When this option is provided, Lua expects the entire script to be passed as an argument, instead of looking for a file to read. This can be useful in scripts or automation tools where the Lua code needs to be executed directly from the command line without the need for a separate file.'
        W: '[AI] The `-W` flag in Lua is used to enable warnings during compilation. When this option is given to the Lua compiler (lua), it will output messages for potential issues in the Lua code, such as unused variables or deprecated functions. This can help developers catch and address potential errors or inconsistencies early on in the development process.'
        e: '[AI] `lua -e` is a command used in the Lua programming language to execute a Lua script directly from the command line, without requiring an external file. The `-e` option indicates that the argument following it contains the Lua code to be executed. For example: `lua -e "print(''Hello World'')"` would output ''Hello World'' in the console.'
        i: '[AI] The `-i` flag in Lua is used when running a Lua script from the command line. It stands for "interactive" mode. When this flag is provided, the Lua interpreter does not just run the script and exit but instead keeps the interpreter session open after executing the script, allowing you to interactively use the Lua environment. This can be useful for testing scripts or exploring Lua code in a more interactive way.'
        l: '[AI] The `-l` flag is used with the Lua interpreter (`lua`) to load and execute Lua libraries or chunks from files. When you run `lua -l file.lua`, it will first load and run the code in `file.lua`, but also search for and automatically import any Lua libraries that it finds, making them available for use in the script. This is particularly useful when working with large projects where multiple files need to be interconnected.'
        v: '[AI] The `-v` option when used with the Lua interpreter (`lua`) displays version and license information about the Lua implementation being run. It simply prints out details such as the Lua version number, build date, and license information to the standard output stream.'
