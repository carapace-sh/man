        [AI] The `jj` part of the command is not a valid Git command, so let's assume it's a typo and the intended command is `git remote list`.

        `git remote list` is a Git command that displays the list of configured remote repositories. Each line in the output shows the short name for the remote, the URL for the remote repository, and (if set) the alias or local branch that tracks this remote. This command helps users keep track of their remote connections and the branches they have set up to pull from/push to those remotes.

        help: '[AI] `jj git remote list --help` is a command used with Git, specifically within the Jira JIRA CLI tool (jj) to display information about the configured upstream repositories or remotes for the current Git repository. The `--help` flag provides detailed information about this specific `git remote list` command, including its syntax and available options. It explains that this command lists the nicknames and their corresponding URLs of the remote repositories currently configured, which can be helpful in understanding the origin or location of each remote branch a local Git repository is tracking.'
