documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant plugin update` command is used to check for and install updates for installed Vagrant plugins. It scans for available plugin updates in the Vagrant registry, downloads and compiles them if necessary, and then installs any newly found updates. This helps keep your Vagrant setup current and takes advantage of new features or bug fixes that may be available. To run the command, simply open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your Vagrant project directory before typing `vagrant plugin update`.'
    flag:
        local: '[AI] `vagrant plugin update --local` is a Vagrant command used to update locally installed plugins without affecting other machines or configurations. This means the changes will only apply to the current working directory and Vagrantfile, not to any other projects using the same plugins. This command fetches the latest version of the specified plugin from the Vagrant plugin repository and installs it on your local system.'
