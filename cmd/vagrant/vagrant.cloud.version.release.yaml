documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud version release` command is not a standard Vagrant command. It appears to be specific to using Hashicorp''s Vagrant Cloud, which is used for managing and sharing Vagrant boxes. This command would likely be used by Vagrant box maintainers to tag, build, and release new versions of their boxes on the Vagrant Cloud platform. The exact details of how it works would depend on the specific workflow and tools used by the maintainer. In general terms, this command could be seen as triggering a process to create a new release of a Vagrant box, associated with a specified version number, which can then be downloaded and used by others from the Vagrant Cloud repository.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud version release --force` command is used to force push a new version of a Vagrant box to the Vagrant Cloud repository, overwriting any existing version with the same name and tag. This can be useful when making a mistake during the box creation process or when needing to quickly update a box with a fix before officially releasing it. It''s important to use this command carefully, as force pushing can overwrite others'' work if they have based their projects on the old version.'
        no-force: '[AI] `vagrant cloud version release --no-force` is a Vagrant command used to release a new version of a box (a pre-configured virtual machine image) to the Vagrant Cloud repository. The `--no-force` option prevents the release of an overwritten box version, ensuring that only new or different versions are uploaded. This helps maintain the integrity and consistency of the available boxes in the repository.'
