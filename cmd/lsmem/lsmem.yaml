documentation:
    command: '[AI] `lsmem` is a Linux command used to display real-time memory usage statistics for processes and the kernel. It shows the total amount of physical and swap memory used by each process, as well as their respective CPU usage, state, and priority. The output can be sorted based on various columns like memory usage or PID. This information can be helpful in identifying memory-intensive processes and optimizing system resources.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `lsmem --all` is a Linux command used to query information about memory usage in the system. The `--all` option requests output for all allocated memory types, including anonymous memory (mmap()), shmget(), and slab caches among others. It provides detailed statistics on memory usage by process or kernel component, which can be helpful for troubleshooting memory-related issues and monitoring system performance.'
        bytes: '[AI] `lsmem` is a Linux command-line utility used to list memory usage in the system. The option `--bytes` requests that the output be displayed in bytes instead of the default format, which is in human-readable units (KB, MB, etc.). With this option, you will get an exact count of the number of bytes consumed by each process or kernel module.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `lsmem --help` is a command used in Linux systems to display help information about the `lsmem` utility. This tool is part of the `ipcs` and `sysstat` packages, which are used for managing Inter-Process Communication (IPC) resources and system statistics respectively.

            The `--help` option specifically provides a concise summary of the various options and their usage when running the `lsmem` command. It lists the available options, their short forms, and brief descriptions of what they do. This helps users understand how to properly utilize the tool to view memory information in a Linux system.
        json: '[AI] `lsmem` is a Linux command-line utility that displays memory usage statistics for processes and the kernel. The option `--json` is used to output the results in JSON format, making it easier to parse and manipulate the data programmatically. This allows tools like scripts or other applications to consume the output more effectively.'
        noheadings: '[AI] `lsmem` is a Linux command used to display memory usage information of processes. The option `--noheadings` instructs `lsmem` not to display column headers, resulting in a raw output of process ID (PID), process name, and memory usage statistics without the header lines.'
        output: '[AI] The `lsmem` is a Linux command-line tool used to display memory usage information. The `--output` option specifies the format of the output. It can be used to customize the displayed columns and their order for better analysis. For instance, `--output=+%memory` will display only the percentage of total RAM used by each process in the output.'
        output-all: |-
            [AI] `lsmem` is a Linux command line utility used to display memory usage information. The option `--output-all` is used to display all available output fields, providing a more detailed and comprehensive view of the system's memory usage. This can include information such as:

            1. Name: The name of the process or kernel module using the memory.
            2. Size: The total amount of Resident (RSS) and Shared (SHM) memory used by each entry.
            3. PID: The Process ID of the corresponding process.
            4. Command line: The command line argument used to start the process, if applicable.
            5. State: The current state of the process, such as running or sleeping.
            6. Scheduled priority: The priority at which the process is scheduled for execution by the kernel.
            7. Nice value: A value adjusting the priority of a process that can be set to make it more or less likely to run.
            8. VMSize: The total Virtual Memory size used by the process.
            9. R Lim: The maximum Resident memory limit allowed for the process.
            10. Shared Libs: The size of shared libraries used by each entry.

            This information can be useful in diagnosing memory-related issues, troubleshooting processes that are consuming excessive resources, and monitoring system performance.
        pairs: '[AI] `lsmem --pairs` is a Linux command used to display memory usage statistics in the format of key-value pairs. The `lsmem` tool is part of the Linux `linux-tools-common` package and is used for analyzing system memory usage. By using the option `--pairs`, the output will be presented as simple key-value pairs, making it easier to parse and process in scripts or other automated tools. The keys represent different memory categories such as "Anon" for anonymous memory, "FileMap" for file-backed memory, and "Slab" for kernel cache memory, among others. The values correspond to the corresponding memory usage amounts in bytes.'
        raw: '[AI] `lsmem` is a Linux command-line tool used to display information about memory usage in the system. The option `--raw` is used to output the memory information in a raw format, which is a simple text representation of memory usage without any formatting or interpretation. This format can be further processed using other tools for more advanced analysis. It displays details such as Process Name, PID, RSS (Resident Set Size), Shared, Text, Libs, and Data memory usage.'
        split: '[AI] `lsmem --split` is a command from the Linux `lsmathutils` package used for analyzing memory usage in Linux systems. The `--split` option splits the output into separate files based on different criteria, such as PID, comm, or namespace, making it easier to analyze specific parts of the memory usage data. This can be useful for gaining deeper insights into the memory consumption patterns of individual processes or namespaces.'
        summary: '[AI] `lsmem --summary` is a Linux command used to display a summary of memory usage by processes, shared libraries, and kernel structures. It provides an overview of total and used memory in various categories such as Processes, Shared Libs, Anon RAM, Buffers, Cached, and Kernel. The output also includes the memory usage percentage and a breakdown of each category''s individual usage by specific components.'
        sysroot: '[AI] `lsmem --sysroot` is a Linux command used to list memory usage by processes, but with the added option `--sysroot`, it operates on the entire system instead of just the current one. The output shows process name, PID, shared and private memory sizes, and other related information for all processes across the system. This command can be useful for identifying memory consumption trends and troubleshooting memory-related issues in a large or complex system.'
        version: '[AI] `lsmem --version` is a command used in Linux systems to check the version of the `lsmem` tool. `lsmem` is a lightweight memory analysis tool that provides an overview of memory usage by processes and their associated namespace memory consumption. By running `lsmem --version`, you can see the specific version number of the installed `lsmem` tool, which helps in keeping track of which version is currently being used for troubleshooting or compatibility purposes.'
