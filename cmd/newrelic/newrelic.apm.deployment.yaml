description: Manage New Relic APM deployment markers
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `newrelic apm deployment` command is used in New Relic''s Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tool to signal that a new deployment or release has been made to an application. This command helps ensure that APM agents are correctly associated with the corresponding applications and their performance data is accurately tracked. The command typically needs to be executed on the server where the New Relic APM agent is installed, either manually or via scripts, after a deployment or release is completed. By providing this information to New Relic, their platform can update application configurations, enabling it to monitor the new code changes and provide accurate performance data for the updated application version.'
