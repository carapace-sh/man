        [AI] The `jj` command is actually a alias or shorthand for Git's plumbing commands, specifically `git config --global alias.jj = 'joint'`. So, the actual Git command behind `jj branch forget` is `git joint forget <branch>`, where `<branch>` is the name of the branch you want to forget.

        This command removes the upstream tracking information for a local Git branch, meaning that Git will no longer try to push or fetch changes from the remote branch with that name. This can be useful if you have a local branch that is outdated or no longer needed and you want to decouple it from its remote counterpart.

        help: '[AI] `jj branch forget --help` is a command used in Jira Software''s Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool, Jira CLI. This specific command is used to remove references to abandoned branches in Jira, typically when you no longer need them in your version control system integrated with Jira (like Git). The `--help` option provides information on how to use this command effectively. It displays detailed instructions, available options, and examples of the `jj branch forget` command.'
