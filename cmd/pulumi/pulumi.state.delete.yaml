documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pulumi state delete` is a command in Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform, used to remove resources marked as current in the local state file. This command does not affect actual infrastructure but only modifies the state representation of the deployed resources, preparing your configuration for deletion. Use it with caution, as the resources will be deleted when you apply your next changes.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `pulumi state delete --force` is a command used in Pulumi, an infrastructure deployment and management tool, to permanently remove a resource or its state data from your Pulumi project''s configuration. The `--force` flag bypasses the confirmation prompt and deletion protection, ensuring that there is no recoverable backup of the resource before it gets deleted. It''s important to use this command with caution as the deleted resources will be removed permanently from your infrastructure and your application configuration.'
        "yes": '[AI] `pulumi state delete --yes` is a command used in Pulumi, an infrastructure deployment and management tool, written in TypeScript. This command is used to permanently remove unmanaged resources from Pulumi''s state file. When invoked with the `--yes` flag, it bypasses confirmation prompts, allowing for force deletion of resources without further input. It does not delete managed resources or the corresponding infrastructure configurations within your codebase. Use this command with caution as undoing the action is not straightforward once executed.'
