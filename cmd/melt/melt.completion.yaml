        [AI] The `melt completions` command is specific to the Zsh shell and is used for managing and displaying possible completions for a given command or text input in the terminal. It is not a standalone command but rather an extension of the built-in completion system in Zsh.

        When you type a partial command or word, Zsh suggests potential completions based on various sources like file names, previously typed commands, and built-in keywords. With the `melt completions` command, you can manipulate these suggestions in various ways:

        1. Display all possible completions: `melt completions <tab>` or just press `<tab>` twice
        2. Select a completion: Use the arrow keys or `<up>` and `<down>` to navigate through the list and press `<Enter>` to select.
        3. Clear the list: Press `<ESC>` to cancel the current suggestion or `<Ctrl> + u` to clear the entire input line.
        4. Customize completion behavior: Configure the behavior of the completion system using `meltoptions`. For example, to always show suggestions for directories and files, use `meltoptions --set-option COMPLETION_WORD_BREAK CHARACTERS="/"`.
