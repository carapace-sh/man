name: push [OPTIONS] [SERVICE...]
description: Push service images
flags:
    --ignore-push-failures: Push what it can and ignores images with push failures
    --include-deps: Also push images of services declared as dependencies
    -q, --quiet: Push without printing progress information
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker-compose push` is a command used with Docker Compose files to build and push Docker images for all services defined in the file to a container registry, such as Docker Hub or Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). It automatically builds the images using the specified Dockerfiles or context if none is provided, then tags the images with the service name and the repository URL, and finally pushes those images to the configured registry.'
    flag:
        ignore-push-failures: '[AI] `docker-compose push --ignore-push-failures` is a command used with Docker Compose to build and push images from a `docker-compose.yml` file to a container registry, ignoring any push failures that might occur. This can be useful when dealing with large or complex applications where some images may take longer to build or have intermittent issues during the push process. Instead of halting the entire build and push process upon encountering such an image, `--ignore-push-failures` allows all other images to continue being built and pushed while the failing image is retried at a later time. It''s important to note that this command does not hide or suppress errors; it merely skips over them in the context of multi-image builds.'
        include-deps: '[AI] `docker-compose push --include-deps` is a command used with Docker Compose to build and push Docker images along with their dependencies. The `--include-deps` flag ensures that the dependency images are also included in the build and push process. This makes it easier to manage multi-container applications where multiple images need to be built and deployed together. Without this flag, you would need to manually build and push each image separately.'
        quiet: '[AI] `docker-compose push --quiet` is a command used in Docker to build and push Docker images defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file to a container registry, such as Docker Hub or Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). The `--quiet` option suppresses the output of the progress bar and other messages during the image build and push processes. This can be useful when running the command in scripts or automated workflows where you want to minimize output for easier processing.'
