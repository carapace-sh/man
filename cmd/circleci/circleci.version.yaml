documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `circleci version` command is not a standard CircleCI command. It seems like you might be confused with other commands or contexts. CircleCI is a continuous integration and delivery platform, and it doesn''t have a built-in command called "circleci version" to display its current version number. If you need to check the CircleCI version for your project, you can look for it in the settings of your CircleCI account online or consult the documentation of the CircleCI library or tools you are using.'
