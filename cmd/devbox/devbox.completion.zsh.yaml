    command: '[AI] The `devbox completion zsh` command is used to install and configure autocompletion for Devbox, a development environment management tool, in Zsh shell. When you run this command, it downloads and adds the necessary files to your Zsh configuration directory, allowing you to get autocompletion suggestions when typing Devbox-related commands in your terminal.'

            [AI] `devbox` is a development environment management tool for creating, sharing, and managing local and remote development environments. The command `devbox completion zsh --no-descriptions` is used to install the Devbox completion for Zsh shell without displaying descriptions during tab expansion.

            The `completion` subcommand enables autocomplete functionality in Zsh, while `zsh` specifies that this configuration is intended for the Zsh shell. The option `--no-descriptions` prevents the display of descriptions when autocompleting. This can make the autocomplete list more compact and faster to navigate, especially when dealing with long or extensive lists.
