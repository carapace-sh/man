        [AI] `brew developer` is not a valid Homebrew (MacOS package manager) command by itself. However, Homebrew provides a tool called `brew install` with the `--developer` flag to install packages from the Homebrew Tap's `develop` branch instead of the stable branch. This can be useful when testing new features or fixing issues in Homebrew packages.

        Example usage:
        ```bash
        $ brew install some-package --developer
        ```
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] The `brew developer --debug` command is a diagnostic tool provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. It runs a specific installation or update of Homebrew using debug mode, which enables verbose output and provides more detailed information about the ongoing process. This can be helpful when troubleshooting build and dependency issues or when encountering errors during Homebrew operations.'
        help: '[AI] `brew developer --help` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command displays help information about using Homebrew as a developer, including how to create and publish your own Homebrew formulae (packages). The output includes options like `--build`, which runs the build process locally when installing a formula, or `--dry-run`, which shows what would be done without actually executing the installation. It also explains how to use GitHub Pages for hosting formulae and other related developer features.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `brew developer --quiet` command is a function in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, used to add or remove a Git repository as a Homebrew tap (a remote repository where Homebrew can fetch and install packages). The `--quiet` flag suppresses informational messages during the operation. So, running `brew developer add <repository> --quiet` or `brew developer remove <repository> --quiet` will add or remove the repository quietly, without displaying any progress or success messages.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `brew developer --verbose` command is a Homebrew (a popular package manager for macOS) command used to install or update Homebrew and its linked repositories with enhanced output. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of information displayed during the installation or update process, providing more details about each step taken. It''s useful for troubleshooting and understanding the underlying processes involved in managing dependencies and maintaining software packages within the Homebrew environment.'
