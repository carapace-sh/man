documentation:
    command: '[AI] The term "starship module" does not refer to a specific command in any known programming language or operating system. It is a concept from science fiction, particularly the Star Trek universe, where a starship is composed of interconnected modules or components, each serving a distinct function such as engineering, living quarters, or navigation. In real life, there''s no standard command or software called "starship module".'
    flag:
        cmd-duration: '[AI] The `--cmd-duration` flag in the `starship` terminal prompt is used to enable and configure the display of command execution time durations in the prompt. When this flag is set, starship will append the elapsed time of each command to its corresponding entry in the history list. By default, it displays the duration in milliseconds preceded by a `"â‰ˆ"` symbol, but you can customize the format using the `$OSH_CMD_DURATION` variable or the `[cmd_duration]` section in your starship configuration file.'
        help: '[AI] The `--help` option is a command used in various programs, including the "starship" terminal prompt customizer, to display detailed information about how to use that specific command or tool. When you run `starship module --help`, it will show you a help message that explains what the `module` subcommand does within starship, and provides examples of how to use it along with any available options or arguments.'
        jobs: '[AI] The `--jobs` flag used with the `starship module` in terminal setup managers like zsh or fish, specifies the number of parallel jobs that can be run by Starship. It helps manage system resources effectively by limiting the maximum number of concurrent processes. For instance, if you set `--jobs 5`, Starship will limit running up to five jobs at a time while other jobs wait in the queue.'
        keymap: '[AI] The `--keymap` flag for the Starship shell prompt customization tool (`starship --keymap`) is used to configure key bindings for various actions within the Starship interface. These keybindings can be customized to suit individual user preferences, enabling efficient interaction with the tool and enhancing productivity.'
        list: '[AI] The `--list` option used with the `starship module list` command is used to display a list of available modules for Starship, a cross-platform, open-source alternative to bash''s PS1 prompt. It does not modify the prompt directly but instead provides a list of modules that can be enabled or disabled to customize its appearance and functionality. The output shows each module name, a brief description, and the current state (enabled or disabled) for easy management.'
        path: '[AI] The `--path` option in the `starship` module for your shell''s terminal configuration (like zsh or fish) specifies a directory path to customize the appearance of the prompt with files or symbols located there. This allows users to have personalized and visually rich prompts, displaying information such as current working directory, Git branch, or other status indicators.'
        status: '[AI] The `--status` flag used with the Starship terminal prompt manager''s `module` command displays the current status and configuration of installed modules. This includes whether a module is enabled or disabled, its version number, and any errors associated with it. If no specific module is specified, the output will show information for all installed modules. This command provides useful information for managing and troubleshooting Starship''s functionality.'
        version: '[AI] The `--version` flag is a command used in various programs, including Starship, to display the current version of the software. When you run `starship --version`, Starship will print out its version number as output, allowing you to verify that the correct version is installed and being used.'
