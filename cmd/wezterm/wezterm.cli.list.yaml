        [AI] The `wezterm cli list` command is not a valid WezTerm command as "cli" stands for Command-Line Interface and WezTerm has its own built-in CLI, but you might be referring to listing available configurations or keys bindings. In that case:

        The `wezterm config list` command displays a JSON representation of all the available configuration options and their current values in WezTerm. It helps users understand what configurations are available and their default settings.

        The `wezterm keys list` command, on the other hand, lists all the registered key bindings in WezTerm along with their corresponding actions. This can be useful for understanding the default bindings or troubleshooting custom key mappings.
    flag:
        format: '[AI] `wezterm cli list --format` is a command used in WezTerm, a versatile terminal emulator for Unix and Windows. This specific command generates a JSON output listing all active tabs, panes, and windows within the WezTerm environment. The `--format` flag customizes the data that gets printed in the output by specifying a format string. The provided format string determines which data is included in the JSON output for further processing or analysis.'

            [AI] `wezterm cli list --help` is a command used in WezTerm, a modern terminal emulator for Unix and Windows. This specific command displays help information about the `list` sub-command.

            The `list` command is used to output various pieces of information about the running WezTerm sessions. The `--help` flag provides a detailed explanation of how to use this command, including available options and their meanings.

            For example, it may display usage like this:
            ```css
            Usage: wezterm cli list [OPTIONS]

            List information about running WezTerm sessions.

            Options:
              --id ID                   Only show session with the given unique session ID.
              --title TITLE             Only show session with the given window title.
              --json                    Output JSON instead of plain text.
              --all                     Show all sessions, not just the most recent one.
              --no-header               Omit the header row when displaying output.
            ```

            This help message explains that `list` can be used to view information about WezTerm sessions using various options like specifying a session ID or title, and the format of the output (plain text or JSON).
