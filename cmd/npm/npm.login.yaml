    command: '[AI] `npm login` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager) to authenticate and create an account or log in to an existing npm account. When you run this command in your terminal, it opens a browser window where you can provide the necessary information to set up or access your account, including your email address, password, and two-factor authentication if enabled. After successfully logging in, npm saves your credentials for easier package publishing and installation from the npm registry.'
    flag:
        scope: '[AI] The `npm login --scope` command is used to authenticate and create an npm (Node Package Manager) registry account or add a new scope to an existing account. A scope represents a namespace for publishing packages under a specific team or organization identity. This command line interface operation prompts the user to input their email, password, and other required information, then registers or updates the specified scope. After authentication is complete, packages can be published using this scoped registry URL.'
