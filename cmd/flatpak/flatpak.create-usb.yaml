    command: '[AI] `flatpak create-usb` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system for Linux. This command creates a bootable USB drive with a predefined set of applications and their dependencies, allowing you to carry the applications with you and run them on any compatible system without needing to install them separately beforehand. It''s particularly useful when dealing with systems that don''t have easy access to an internet connection or a package manager for Flatpak software installation. The usage is: `flatpak create-usb [OPTIONS] OUTPUT_DEVICE`, where OUTPUT_DEVICE specifies the USB device to be used.'
    flag:
        allow-partial: '[AI] `flatpak create-usb` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. The `--allow-partial` option enables creating a bootable USB drive with an incomplete installation of the operating system or a live session image. This means that not all packages are installed during the creation process, which makes the procedure faster and allows users to add or remove packages afterwards on the target system. The resulting USB stick can be used for installation, live testing, or recovery purposes.'
        app: |-
            [AI] The `flatpak create-usb` command is a utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux. This command creates a bootable USB drive with a pre-installed set of applications in the form of Flatpaks. The `--app` option specifies that only the specified application(s) should be installed on the USB drive.

            For example, if you have an ISO image containing the application you want to install, you can create a USB drive with that application using the following command:

            ```bash
            flatpak create-usb <USB_DEVICE> <APPLICATION_ISO_FILE>.iso --app <APP_ID>
            ```

            Replace `<USB_DEVICE>` with the path to your USB device, `<APPLICATION_ISO_FILE>` with the path to your ISO image file containing the application, and `<APP_ID>` with the Flatpak ID of the application. This command will create a bootable USB drive containing only the specified application, which can then be used to install and run the application on other Linux systems without requiring an internet connection or additional package installation steps.
        arch: '[AI] `flatpak create-usb` is a command-line utility from Flatpak, a popular application packaging system for Linux and its derivatives. The `--arch` option specifies the architecture of the target OS when creating a live USB or disk image for installation or testing. This flag instructs the tool to build an image that is compatible with the specified architecture (e.g., i686, x86_64) and ensures that the resulting media can be installed on systems with that architecture.'
        destination-repo: '[AI] `flatpak create-usb` is a command-line tool provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The `--destination-repo` option specifies the name of a new Flatpak repository that will be created on the USB drive. This flag allows users to build a custom repository containing their chosen applications packaged as Flatpaks directly onto a USB drive. Once the USB is inserted into another system, the new repository can be activated, making those applications available for installation.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `flatpak create-usb` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The purpose of this command is to create a USB flash drive containing a live operating system image or a set of applications packaged using the Flatpak format.

            The `--help` option is used to display detailed information about how to use the command, including available options and their descriptions. Here's a brief summary:

            ```plaintext
            usage: flatpak create-usb [OPTIONS] SOURCE [DESTINATION]

            Create a USB stick containing a live OS or apps.

            Options:
              --user        Install the image as a user (default: no)
              --force       Force overwrite existing data on DESTINATION
                             (default: ask for confirmation)
              --no-reboot    Don't reboot after writing the image to the USB stick
              --verbose      Show verbose output during the process
              --help         Show this help message and exit.
            ```

            The basic usage of the command is `flatpak create-usb [SOURCE] [DESTINATION]`, where:

            1. `[SOURCE]` specifies the path to the image file or the URL for a live OS image to be written to the USB drive.
            2. `[DESTINATION]` refers to the path to the target USB device or its label (e.g., /dev/sdX or /dev/sda1).

            Additionally, the command supports various options like `--user`, `--force`, `--no-reboot`, `--verbose`, and `--help`. These options allow customizing the behavior of the command, such as installing images as a user, overwriting data on the destination, preventing automatic reboots, and displaying verbose output.
        installation: '[AI] `flatpak create-usb` is a command-line utility in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. The `--installation` option creates a live USB or DVD image with a pre-installed set of applications from Flatpak repositories. When you write this image to a USB stick and boot from it, the system will run these applications in a disposable and isolated environment without modifying the host system. This is useful for creating portable and consistent development or testing environments.'
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak create-usb` is a command-line tool provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. The `--ostree-verbose` option is used with this command to create a live USB or ISO image using the OSTree version control system in a verbose mode. In simple terms, it generates a detailed log during the process of creating the USB image or installable media with the Flatpak software bundles and the OSTree filesystem.'
        runtime: |-
            [AI] `flatpak create-usb` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a popular application packaging and deployment system for Linux platforms. The `--runtime` option modifies the behavior of this command.

            When using `create-usb --runtime`, the tool creates a bootable USB drive containing a minimal Flatpak runtime environment. This environment allows other systems to run Flatpak applications without requiring a full installation of the host system. The resulting USB stick can be used as an alternative to traditional Live CDs or install media for running and testing applications in various Linux environments.
        system: '[AI] The `flatpak create-usb` command is a utility provided by Flatpak, a popular application packaging system for Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. The `--system` option that follows this command instructs it to create a live USB or DVD installer for the currently running system. In simpler terms, it generates a bootable media containing the necessary files and configurations to install Flatpak and its applications at the target machine. It''s particularly useful when dealing with systems that don''t have easy access to an internet connection or if you wish to create multiple identical installations.'
        user: '[AI] The `flatpak create-usb` command is a utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system for Linux and its derivatives. This specific command (`--user`) creates a live USB or SD card that can be used to install and run applications packaged using Flatpak, without affecting the system as a whole. The resulting media can be booted on any compatible system to run the installed applications directly from it, making it useful for testing new software or providing a portable environment.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak create-usb` is a command-line utility for creating a live USB or SD card containing a Flatpak-based Linux distribution. The `--verbose` option increases the output of the command to provide more detailed information about the creation process, including progress updates and debugging messages. This helps users understand what''s happening during the creation of their bootable media and can be useful for troubleshooting any issues that may arise.'
