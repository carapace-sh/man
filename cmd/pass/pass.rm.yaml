    -r, --recursive: remove recursively
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pass rm` command is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It seems to be specific to Pass, a password manager developed for privacy and security. The `rm` in this context stands for "remove," which means deleting an entry from the Pass database. When used with the `pass` command, it typically takes the path to the relevant data file as an argument, e.g., `pass rm ~/.local/share/pass/passwords/my_vault.db my_entry`.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The command `rm --force` is used in Unix-based operating systems to remove files or directories permanently, without prompting for confirmation. The `--force` option (or `-f`) tells the `rm` command to override any non-empty directories and not ask for confirmation before deletion. So, if you run `rm --force <file/directory>`, it will be deleted immediately and irreversibly.'
        recursive: '[AI] The command `rm -r` is a Unix/Linux terminal command used to remove directories and their contents recursively. The `-r` or `--recursive` option ensures that all files and subdirectories under the specified directory are deleted. When you use `pass rm --recursive <directory>`, replace `<directory>` with the name of the directory you want to delete, including the path if necessary. Be cautious as using this command without careful consideration can result in data loss.'
