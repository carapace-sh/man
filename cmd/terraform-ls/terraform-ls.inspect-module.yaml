            [AI] `terraform-ls inspect-module` is a command provided by Terraform Language Server (TLS), which is used to analyze and provide metadata about Terraform modules. The `inspect-module` subcommand takes the path to a module directory as an argument and returns various information about it, including its version, input variables, output values, and provider requirements.

            The `-verbose` flag is optional and when used, increases the amount of information displayed during the inspection process. This can be useful for debugging or for gaining a deeper understanding of the module's structure and behavior.
