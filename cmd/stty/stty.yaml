documentation:
    command: '[AI] `stty` is a terminal control command used in Unix-based operating systems for configuring and querying serial port settings, such as baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits, and flow control. It can be used to set terminal options both interactively and non-interactively. For example, `stty 115200 bdsr` sets the baud rate of device file `/dev/ttyS0` to 115200 bps.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `stty --all` is a command used in Unix-based systems to set terminal options for all available terminals or tty devices. The `--all` option applies the given settings to every terminal device in the system, rather than just the current one. It''s commonly used to apply consistent configurations across multiple terminals. For example, you might use it to set a custom input speed or flow control settings for all terminals. However, be cautious when using `--all`, as misconfigurations could impact system stability or usability.'
        file: '[AI] The `stty --file` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to set or get the terminal settings of a file descriptor instead of the default console. The `--file` option specifies the filename or file descriptor number of the device file to be configured, allowing you to apply terminal settings to non-interactive processes or files. This can be useful in scripting or automation scenarios where controlling a device''s input/output characteristics is necessary.'
        help: '[AI] `stty --help` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems to display help information about the `stty` utility. The `stty` command is used to set and query terminal settings, such as input and output baud rates, flow control, and other options. By invoking it with the `--help` option, you will see a detailed explanation of how to use `stty`, including available commands and their options. This information can be helpful when configuring a terminal or serial connection for various applications.'
        save: '[AI] The `stty --save` command is used in Unix-like operating systems to save the current terminal settings to a file. The terminal settings refer to various attributes like input and output baud rates, flow control, and local and remote character echoing. This command modifies the terminal file associated with the current terminal device, typically located under `/etc/termcap` or `/usr/share/terminfo`. When used without any options, the changes are saved in the system-wide termcap database, but it can be specified to save into a user-specific file using the `--file` option. It''s commonly utilized when configuring terminals with specific settings for different applications or devices.'
        version: '[AI] `stty --version` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to display the version information of the `stty` (set terminal mode) utility. It provides details about the installed version, such as the name, version number, and compilation date. The output helps users check for updates or compatibility with other software that relies on this utility.'
