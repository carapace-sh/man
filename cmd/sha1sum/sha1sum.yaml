documentation:
    command: '[AI] `sha1sum` is a command-line utility used to compute the SHA-1 hash of files. A hash function is a mathematical method for converting data into a fixed-size string of characters. The SHA-1 algorithm is a specific type of hash function that generates a 40-character hexadecimal string as output, ensuring the data''s integrity and uniqueness. By using this command, users can verify the authenticity and accuracy of files by comparing the calculated hash value with the known or expected hash value.'
    flag:
        binary: '[AI] `sha1sum --binary` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to compute the SHA-1 checksum of a file. The `--binary` option is used to output the raw binary checksum instead of the typical text representation with colons separating each group of bytes. The resulting output consists of 40 hexadecimal digits representing the SHA-1 hash value of the file.'
        check: '[AI] `sha1sum --check` is a command used in Unix-based systems to verify the integrity of files by comparing their SHA-1 checksums. It reads a list of file and checksum pairs from a text file, and compares the computed SHA-1 checksum of each file with the provided checksum. If they match, the file is assumed to be authentic. The command outputs a message for each file indicating whether the verification was successful or not.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `sha1sum` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems for computing the SHA-1 hash of files. The `--help` option displays detailed help information about how to use the `sha1sum` command. Here's a brief summary:

            When you run `sha1sum --help`, it will output a text explaining various options and usage examples for the command. Some common options include:

            - `--algorithm=ALGORITHM`: Specify the hash algorithm to use (default is SHA-1).
            - `FILE` or `-:`: Process standard input instead of a file.
            - `--check` or `-c`: Verify the checksums in a given file.
            - `--output=FILENAME`: Write output to a specific file instead of standard output.

            Additionally, it will provide examples of how to use each option with various scenarios, such as computing the hash of a file or checking the integrity of an archive against its checksums.
        ignore-missing: '[AI] The `sha1sum --ignore-missing` command is used in Unix-like operating systems to compute the SHA-1 checksum of files, while ignoring files with missing paths or files that cannot be read. This can be useful when checking the integrity of a large number of files where some may not exist or have incorrect permissions. The `--ignore-missing` option ensures that only the existing and readable files are included in the checksum calculation.'
        quiet: '[AI] `sha1sum --quiet` is a command used in Unix-based systems to compute the SHA-1 checksum of files and print only the checksum itself, without any other output. The `--quiet` option suppresses any informational messages or progress indicators that are usually displayed during the calculation process.'
        status: '[AI] `sha1sum --status` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to verify the SHA-1 checksums of files and print the result in a human-readable format. The `--status` option displays only the filenames and their corresponding correct or incorrect checksum status, making it useful for quickly checking the integrity of multiple files without showing the full hash values.'
        strict: '[AI] The `sha1sum --strict` command is a utility in Unix-based systems used for computing the SHA-1 message digest of files and checking their integrity. The `--strict` option ensures that only files with exact matching sizes are checked, as it requires both the SHA-1 checksum and file size to validate before considering the comparison successful. This adds an extra layer of security by verifying not just the checksum but also the file size, helping prevent potential attacks where an attacker may alter the file size while keeping the checksum unchanged.'
        tag: '[AI] `sha1sum --tag` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to compute the SHA-1 hash of one or more files and display the hash value along with each file''s name and its tag (symbolic link target if present). The tag is displayed if the file is a symbolic link. This can be useful when managing packages or verifying software integrity.'
        text: '[AI] `sha1sum --text` is a command in Unix-like operating systems used to compute and display the SHA-1 hash of a file in text format. The "--text" option specifies that only the hexadecimal hash value should be printed, without the filename prefix or any line breaks between hashes. For example, if a file named "example.txt" has the SHA-1 hash `a94a5f16dbb734465a1761d30b33c28b9e100ef4`, running `sha1sum --text example.txt` would output `a94a5f16dbb734465a1761d30b33c28b9e100ef4`.'
        version: '[AI] The `sha1sum` command with the `--version` option is used to display the version information of the installed SHA1 checksum calculation tool on a Unix or Linux system. It provides details about the version number, compilation options, and other relevant information. This can be helpful in determining if an update or installation is necessary for the SHA1 sum tool.'
        warn: '[AI] `sha1sum --warn` is a command used in Unix-based systems to compute the SHA-1 checksum of files and directories, but with a warning mode enabled. This means that if the computed checksum does not match the expected one, instead of overwriting the original file, it will only print a warning message and ask for confirmation before proceeding with any replacement action. This is useful in preventing accidental data loss when verifying the integrity of important files or distributions.'
        zero: '[AI] The `sha1sum --zero <file>` command generates a new, zero-padded SHA-1 checksum for the given file and prints it to the standard output. The "--zero" option adds leading zeros to make the output string have a length of 40 characters. If no file is specified, it calculates the checksum from standard input instead.'
