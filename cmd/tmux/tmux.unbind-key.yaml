    command: '[AI] `tmux unbind-key` is a TMUX command used to remove or disable a key binding in the terminal multiplexer application, tmux. The general format is `tmux unbind-key [-g] <key> <action>`. The `<key>` is the key combination to be removed, and `<action>` refers to the action associated with it. The `-g` flag makes the change apply system-wide across all tmux sessions. Without the flag, only the current session is affected.'
    flag:
        T: '[AI] The `tmux unbind-key` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to remove a key binding. The `-T` option is used with this command to specify a target session or window title. For example, `tmux unbind-key -T ''my-session:*'' keyspec` would remove the specified keyspec binding for all sessions and windows with the title starting with "my-session". Without the `-T` option, the unbinding is applied to the current session only.'
        a: '[AI] `tmux unbind-key` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to modify key bindings. The `-a` option makes it apply the modification to all sessions, not just the current one. So `tmux unbind-key -a KEYCombination` will remove the given keyboard shortcut binding across all active TMUX sessions.'
        "n": '[AI] The `tmux` command `unbind-key -n` is used to remove the binding of a key or key combination in the `tmux` terminal multiplexer. The `-n` option indicates that the argument is the number of the key or key combination, rather than a key identifier string (like "C-b" for Control-B). For example, `unbind-key -n 15` would unbind the key sequence corresponding to the F13 key.'
        q: '[AI] The `tmux` command `unbind-key -q` is used to unbind a key binding in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. The `-q` option makes Tmux quiet, meaning it will not print any output or confirmation message after the keybinding is unset. For example, `unbind-key -q C-b` will remove the default binding of `Ctrl-B` as the prefix key. This command can be useful when you want to change the default behavior and prevent accidentally triggering a bound action.'
