        [AI] `kubeadm reset` is a Kubernetes utility used to reset or recreate a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm, including etcd, the central component that stores the cluster configuration and member data. The `remove-etcd-member` phase is one of several available when running `kubeadm reset`.

        This command removes the local ETCD member node from the cluster, deleting the ETCD data directory, which contains the current cluster state. After running this command, you can recreate the ETCD member node and rejoin it to the cluster with new or updated configuration if needed. This is useful in scenarios such as upgrading etcd or your Kubernetes control plane components, or when dealing with issues related to a specific ETCD member.
    flag:
        kubeconfig: |-
            [AI] The `kubeadm reset` command with the `phase remove-etcd-member --kubeconfig` flag is used to remove a member node from an Etcd cluster in a Kubernetes cluster.

            Etcd is a distributed key-value store that is used as the back-end for the Kubernetes cluster's APIs. Each Kubernetes cluster has a quorum of Etcd members that ensures data consistency. The `remove-etcd-member` phase in `kubeadm reset` command is responsible for removing a member node from the Etcd cluster.

            The `--kubeconfig` flag indicates that the command should be executed using the specified Kubernetes configuration file, instead of the default one located in `~/.kube/config`. This allows you to manage multiple clusters on a single machine, each with its own unique configuration.
