documentation:
    command: '[AI] "Waypoint Runner" is a navigation command used in autonomous systems, particularly in robotics and drones, to follow a pre-defined sequence of geographic positions or waypoints. The system moves from one waypoint to the next in a specific order, typically using GPS or other positioning systems for location determination and obstacle avoidance sensors for safe navigation. The goal is to reach each waypoint accurately while minimizing deviation from the intended path. Waypoint Runner facilitates efficient, automated mission planning and execution.'
