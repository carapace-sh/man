    -D, --direct: Upload asset directly to backend storage
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vagrant cloud provider upload` is a Vagrant command used to upload a customized VirtualBox or other provisioned VM image to the Vagrant Cloud (now called Atlantis) for sharing with others. It packages and registers the box file, along with its associated metadata, in the Atlas registry so it can be easily downloaded and used by others in their Vagrant projects. This command helps to create a reusable, versioned environment for consistent development setup.'
    flag:
        direct: '[AI] `vagrant cloud provider upload --direct` is a Vagrant command used to push a customized Vagrant box directly to Atlas, a cloud service by HashiCorp for sharing and discovering Vagrant boxes. The `--direct` option bypasses Vagrant Hub and uploads the box file(s) as a private box without going through the public registry. This is useful when you want to keep your box private or share it with specific team members without making it publicly available.'
        no-direct: |-
            [AI] The `vagrant cloud provider upload --no-direct` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command is specifically related to Vagrant's ability to use external providers for managing infrastructure, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.

            The `upload` subcommand is responsible for pushing the configured box (a packaged VM image) to Vagrant Cloud, a public registry maintained by Hashicorp, the creators of Vagrant. The `--no-direct` flag instructs Vagrant not to use a direct connection to upload the box. Instead, it will upload the box via an HTTP or HTTPS connection to the provider's API, which can be useful when the local machine does not have a stable or secure connection to Vagrant Cloud.

            In summary, `vagrant cloud provider upload --no-direct` is used to upload a Vagrant box to the Vagrant Cloud registry using an HTTP(S) connection instead of a direct one.
