documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "ion" command is not a standard command in Unix or Linux systems. It seems to be misspelled or incorrect. Please check for typos or consult the documentation of any specific software you''re using, as it may have a different meaning in certain contexts.'
    flag:
        c: '[AI] The `ion` command is a popular data manager for Git repositories. The option `-c` or `--config` is used to load or modify the Ion configuration file. It allows users to set various preferences, hooks, and aliases for their Ion workflow. For example, you can use `ion config set alias.stash stash save --keep-index` to create an alias named "stash" that saves your changes before creating a Git stash.'
        fake-interactive: '[AI] The `--fake-interactive` flag in Docker commands is used to create a new container in detached mode (`-d`), but it simulates interactive behavior by printing container logs to the console, allowing users to interact with the container''s output as if it were an interactive terminal session. This can be useful for debugging or inspecting containers without having to attach to them directly.'
        help: '[AI] `ion help` is a command used in Ion CLI, a tool for managing Kubernetes clusters and applications. The `--help` flag is an option provided with this command that displays detailed usage information, including available sub-commands and their descriptions. It''s useful for quickly learning about the capabilities of Ion CLI without having to refer to external documentation.'
        interactive: '[AI] The `--interactive` flag in IoT (Internet of Things) projects, specifically when using tools like Node-RED or MQTT clients, enables an interactive console session. This allows users to manually input data and commands as if working in a local terminal, making it easier for debugging and real-time interaction with the connected devices. This flag facilitates a more dynamic experience compared to scripts or batch processes.'
        no-execute: '[AI] The `--no-execute` flag in the ion (iOS simulator) command-line tool disables the execution of any attached scripts or custom extensions during the installation of an iOS app from the command line using Xcodebuild. This helps maintain the security and integrity of the installed app, as untrusted code is not executed during the installation process.'
        o: '[AI] The `-o` option in the context of the `ion` command is used to specify an output file for the operation being performed. For instance, when using `ion cp sourcefile destination`, the `-o` option can be added followed by a filename to save the output of the copy operation into that file instead of the default output (which would be the same name as the destination file).'
        version: '[AI] The `ion info --version` command is used to display the version information of Ion, a popular open-source CLI tool for managing Kubernetes clusters and applications. This command provides details about the specific version of Ion that is currently installed and being used in your terminal or command line interface. Understanding the version can help you keep track of updates and ensure compatibility with other tools and clusters.'
        x: |-
            [AI] The `ion ion-x` command is a Unix utility used in the ION operating system or in ion-based file systems like ZFS. The `ion-x` command is specifically used to change the compression algorithm and level for files or directories.

            When you use `ion ion-x <path>`, followed by either `zlib:<level>` (for zlib compression) or `lz4:<level>` (for LZ4 compression), it sets the specified compression algorithm and level for the given path. The `level` is a number representing the desired compression ratio versus speed trade-off. Higher levels provide better compression at the cost of slower write performance.
