documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubeadm certs generate-csr` is a command used in Kubernetes to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for a new certificate. It''s typically utilized during the initial setup of a Kubernetes cluster or when adding new nodes to an existing one. The generated CSR is then used to request and obtain a signed certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA), which can be applied to various components like the etcd server, Kubernetes API server, and controller-manager, ensuring secure communication within the cluster.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: '[AI] `kubeadm certs generate-csr --cert-dir` is a command used in Kubernetes to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for a new certificate. The `--cert-dir` flag specifies the directory where the generated CSR and resulting certificates will be saved. Once the CSR is created, it can be signed by a CA (Certificate Authority) to obtain a valid certificate that can be used to secure communication between Kubernetes components or external clients.'
        config: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm certs generate-csr --config` is a command used in Kubernetes to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for a new certificate. This command is typically run as part of setting up a new Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm, an open-source tool for deploying a Kubernetes cluster.

            The `--config` option specifies the path to a configuration file that defines the details of the CSR, such as the common name (CN), organization name, and country. Once the CSR is generated, it can be signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) to create a new certificate. This certificate can then be used to secure communication between various components in the Kubernetes cluster.
        kubeconfig-dir: '[AI] `kubeadm certs generate-csr` is a command used to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for Kubernetes components'' certificates. The option `--kubeconfig-dir` specifies the directory where the generated certificates and corresponding kubeconfig files will be saved after issuing the certificate. This command is typically run on a machine that will serve as a control plane node in a Kubernetes cluster during initial setup or when rotating certificates.'
