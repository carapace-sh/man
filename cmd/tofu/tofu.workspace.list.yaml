    command: '[AI] The `tofu workspace list` command is used in Tofu, a Git-based data versioning system, to display a list of workspaces that exist in the current Tofu environment. Workspaces represent different environments or versions of your project data where you can safely experiment and iterate without affecting your production data. The output of this command shows the name and status (active or inactive) for each workspace, helping users manage their data versioning workflow effectively.'
