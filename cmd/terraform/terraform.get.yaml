    command: '[AI] The `terraform get` command is used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, to fetch or update the latest versions of the configured Terrform Providers and Backends from their respective registries. By running this command, Terraform ensures that your projects use the most recent version of the necessary components, which can help maintain compatibility and take advantage of new features.'
    flag:
        no-color: '[AI] The `terraform get -no-color` command is used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, to fetch and apply the latest versions of configured modules and backends from the Terraform Registry without displaying any colored output. This is useful when running Terraform in automated or headless environments where colorized output may not be desired or supported.'
        update: '[AI] `terraform get -update` is a command used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. This command is used to retrieve and update Terraform-managed files from their configured version control system (VCS) sources. The `-update` flag ensures that only the files with changes are downloaded or updated, minimizing the time and resources required for the operation. It helps keep your Terraform configuration in sync with the latest version controlled code.'
