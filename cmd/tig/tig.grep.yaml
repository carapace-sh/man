documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tig grep` is a command used in the TIG (The Silver Searcher) text editor for Git repositories. It performs a case-sensitive, recursive search for a given text pattern across all files in the current Git repository. The search results are displayed in split view within the TIG editor itself, allowing users to navigate through and edit the matching lines directly from the search result list. This command is especially useful when working with large codebases and looking for specific code snippets.'
