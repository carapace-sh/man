        [AI] `glab release delete` is a GitLab CI/CD command used to delete an existing release in GitLab. This command requires specifying the release identifier, which can be obtained from the release's name or its ID, and is typically used within a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file under the `release` job section. For example:

        ```yaml
        release:
          stage: releases
          script:
            - glab release delete my_release
        ```

        Make sure you have the necessary permissions to perform this action, as deleting a release cannot be undone.
    flag:
        with-tag: |-
            [AI] The `glab release delete` command is used in GitLab to delete a specific release tag from a repository. The `--with-tag` option indicates that the specified tag should be deleted as well.

            Here's a brief explanation of each part:

            * `glab`: This is the name of the tool used for managing GitLab repositories from the command line.
            * `release`: This specifies that we are working with GitLab releases, which are snapshots of a project at a specific point in time.
            * `delete`: This is the action we want to perform, which is to delete a release.
            * `--with-tag`: This option tells `glab` to also delete the tag associated with the release when it is deleted.

            So, the entire command `glab release delete --with-tag <RELEASE> <TAG>` deletes the specified release `<RELEASE>` and its associated tag `<TAG>`.
        "yes": '[AI] The command `glab release delete --yes` is used to permanently delete a GitLab Release from the GitLab repository. The `--yes` or `-y` flag is used to confirm that the user intends to perform this action without any further prompts for confirmation. When you run this command, GitLab will immediately delete the selected release. It''s an irreversible operation, so be cautious when using it.'
