documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker secret ls` command is used to list all the Docker secrets that have been created on a Docker host. Secrets are encrypted and store sensitive data such as passwords or API keys, which can then be referenced in Docker compose files or used when running containers. The output of this command includes the name, creation time, and encryption key size for each secret.'
    flag:
        filter: '[AI] `docker secret ls --filter` is a command used in Docker to list all stored secrets managed by Docker Secrets. The `--filter` option allows filtering the output based on specific conditions. In this case, it filters the output to only show the names of the secrets that match the given condition. By default, no filter is applied, and all secrets are listed.'
        format: '[AI] `docker secret ls --format` is a command used in Docker to list all stored secrets in the Docker Registry or Docker Swarm mode. The `--format` option allows customizing the output format of the command. In this case, it''s used to specify how the listed secrets should be displayed. By default, the command outputs a table with columns for secret name, ID, and creation timestamp. However, you can customize the output using various templates provided by `--format`. For instance, `"{{.Name}} {{.CreationDate}}"` might display the secret names along with their creation dates.'
        quiet: '[AI] `docker secret ls --quiet` is a command used in Docker to list all defined secrets without any extra output. The `--quiet` or `-q` option is used to display only the name of each secret, as opposed to the more verbose output that includes additional information such as creation timestamp and other details. This command can be useful when you need to automate the listing of Docker secrets for scripting purposes.'
