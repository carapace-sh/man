documentation:
    command: '[AI] `consul info` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. This command returns detailed information about the Consul cluster, including its server and client members, data centers, services, keys, and other settings. It provides real-time insight into the current state of the Consul deployment, making it useful for debugging issues, verifying configurations, and monitoring the health of the system.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] The `consul info --ca-file` command is used with Consul, a Connect and Orchestrate (CSOC) tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This specific command retrieves various consul cluster information in JSON format, but with the addition of `--ca-file` flag, it writes the root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate to a file instead of printing it on the console. The output file path is not explicitly mentioned in the command and by default it will be saved as "ca.pem" in the current working directory. This flag ensures a secure communication between clients and consul servers by validating server''s certificates against the CA certificate.'
        ca-path: '[AI] `consul info --ca-path` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source service discovery, configuration, and orchestration tool. This command returns the paths to the Consul TLS certificates and keys (CA files) stored in the running agent or server. The output shows two strings under the `CA Path` key: one for the server certificate authority (CA) and another for the client certificate authority (CA). These files are essential for secure communication between different Consul components within a cluster.'
        client-cert: '[AI] `consul info --client-cert` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, a Connect and Service Mesh platform. It retrieves and displays the client certificate information for an agent or client registered with the Consul service. The output includes details such as the common name (CN), expiration date, and public key of the client certificate. This command helps in verifying and managing the identity of clients communicating with the Consul server.'
        client-key: '[AI] The `consul info --client-key` command is used with the Consul service discovery and configuration tool. This command retrieves and displays the Client Name, Client ID, and Client Key for a registered agent in a Consul cluster. The Client Key is a unique identifier assigned to each registered agent, allowing secure communication between the agent and Consul servers. It''s essential for implementing access control policies based on agents in Consul.'
        http-addr: '[AI] `consul info --http-addr` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, a Connect and Service Mesh platform. This command''s purpose is to display the current HTTP address where the Consul server or agent is listening for incoming requests. By providing this flag, you get an output with the Consul''s HTTP interface endpoint, which can be useful when configuring clients or other services that need to communicate with the Consul instance.'
        tls-server-name: '[AI] The `consul info --tls-server-name` command is used with the Consul CLI (Command Line Interface) tool to retrieve information about a Consul server or cluster''s TLS configuration, specifically the server name that should be used for TLS client connections. This flag helps ensure secure communication between clients and the Consul server by allowing the client to verify the server''s identity using TLS certificates with the provided server name.'
        token: '[AI] The `consul info --token` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, a service discovery and configuration management tool. This command retrieves and displays the consul server''s information including its version, datacenter name, agent information, and the currently valid tokens. A token is an authentication method for secure communication between clients (agents) and the Consul server. It helps enforce access control policies in a distributed system environment.'
        token-file: '[AI] The `consul info --token-file` command is used with Consul, a Connect and Config management tool. This command retrieves information about a Consul server or client, and writes the server''s ACL token to a file specified by the `--token-file` flag. This allows secure access to Consul API functionalities for tasks like managing services, configurations, and connecting clients, among others.'
