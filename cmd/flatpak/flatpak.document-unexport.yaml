documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flatpak document-unexport` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. This command is used to unexport previously exported application sandboxed documents, allowing the changes made within the sandboxed environment to be discarded. Essentially, it undoes the effect of `flatpak document-export`, enabling you to start with a fresh sandbox when working on your application.'
    flag:
        doc-id: '[AI] `flatpak document-unexport` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux platforms. The `--doc-id` option is used to specify the identifier of a document that was previously exported from a Flatpak application using the `document-export` command. The `flatpak document-unexport` command is used to unexport the document, effectively revoking access to it outside of the original application sandbox. By running `flatpak document-unexport --doc-id <document-id>`, you''re instructing Flatpak to remove access to the specified document from the global file system, thereby enhancing security by preventing unauthorized access or manipulation of sensitive data.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The command `flatpak document-unexport` is a Flatpak utility used to unexport previously exported documents (saved states of applications) to be shared or distributed as external files. The `--help` option displays the detailed help information for this command, including its syntax, available options, and brief descriptions. Here's an overview:

            ```bash
            flatpak document-unexport [OPTIONS] PACKAGE REVISION FILE

            Unexports a saved document in a Flatpak application and saves it as a file.

            Options:
              -h, --help              Show this help message and exit.
              --quiet                 Do not output informational messages.
              --force                 Force the operation even if it is not possible or dangerous.
            ```

            Usage: Export an existing document (using another command like `flatpak save-document`) with a Flatpak application and then unexport it using this command, providing the package name, revision number, and output file path as arguments.
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak document-uneexport` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager for creating local modifications to a Flatpak application or runtime in the form of a Flatpak manifest document. The `--ostree-verbose` option is added to this command to provide detailed information while making an unsandboxed copy (exporting) the current state of the filesystem inside the application or runtime, and storing it as an OSTree tree instead of the default file format when creating the new manifest document. This option increases the verbosity level during the export process, enabling more comprehensive information to be displayed in the terminal.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] `flatpak document-unexport` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. This command exports a document or an application's data as a separate file or folder for backup or sharing purposes.

            The `--verbose` flag, when used with this command, increases the level of output details provided during the execution process. It helps to display more detailed information about the exporting process and the files/directories being exported. This can be useful for debugging purposes or simply for understanding what data is being exported.
