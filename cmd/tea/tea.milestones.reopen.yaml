documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea milestones reopen` command in Teamspeak Query Language (TQL) is used to reopen a previously closed milestone in a Teamspeak Server Query. Milestones are markers that represent specific stages of a project or task, and they can be opened or closed as needed to reflect the current status. By executing this command, any closed milestone will be set back to an open state.'
    flag:
        login: '[AI] The command `tea milestones reopen --login` is used in the Teamwork project management tool. This command is used to reopen a previously closed milestone and make it available for new work to be added. The `--login` option requires that you provide your Teamwork login credentials to authenticate and authorize the action, ensuring only authorized users can modify milestones.'
        output: |-
            [AI] The `tea milestones reopen --output` command is a part of Jenkins' Templated Projects for Jenkins Pipelines (also known as the "Pipeline: Define Pipelines with Groovy" plugin). This command is used to programmatically modify Jenkins pipelines.

            The specific command `tea milestones reopen` reopens all the previously closed milestones in the specified pipeline. The `--output` flag is used to specify an output file where the result of the command will be saved, typically a JSON or XML format file, for further processing or analysis.
        remote: |-
            [AI] `tea milestones reopen --remote` is a command used in GitLab's continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) tool called GitLab CI/CD. This command is utilized to programmatically manage the lifecycle of specific milestones in a GitLab project, allowing for remote execution.

            Specifically, this command reopens previously closed milestones in a project over the remote Git protocol. The `--remote` flag signifies that the operation should be performed against the remote repository, rather than a local copy of the project. This can be helpful when managing milestones across multiple branches or remote projects where direct access to the GitLab interface may not be possible.
        repo: '[AI] The command `tea milestones reopen --repo` is used in GitLab''s built-in continuous integration and delivery tool, GitLab CI/CD, to reopen all previously closed milestones for a specific repository. This can be helpful when you want to allow new work to be added to ongoing projects or if there are changes that need to be made to previously completed milestones. The `--repo` option specifies the name of the repository where the milestones are located.'
