    -vendor: exclude tests of dependencies
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `go mod why` is a command used in Go programming language to explain the origin and justification for the dependencies listed in a `go.mod` file. It shows the reasons why specific modules are needed based on the imports declared in the source code files, by tracing the dependencies from the direct imports down to their ultimate sources. This command helps in understanding the dependency tree and the rationale behind each module inclusion.'
    flag:
        m: '[AI] The `go mod why -m` command is used in Go programming language to display the module and version specified in the go.mod file for a given package import path. It prints the effective Go Mod file (go.mod or go.sum) and the corresponding imported module and version, helping users understand the dependencies of their projects.'
        vendor: '[AI] The `go mod why -vendor` command is used with the Go Mod tool in Golang to display the direct and transitive dependencies of a given module, including their vendor branches or paths if they have been set explicitly in the go.mod file. It helps developers understand the full dependency tree of their project, which can be useful for debugging issues related to dependencies, versioning, or vendor management.'
