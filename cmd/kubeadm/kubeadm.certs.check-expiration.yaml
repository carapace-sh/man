description: Check certificates expiration for a Kubernetes cluster
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save the certificates
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubeconfig=: The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster. If the flag is not set, a set of standard locations can be searched for an existing kubeconfig file.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubeadm certs check-expiration` is a command used with Kubernetes using `kubeadm`, the Kubernetes initialization tool. This command checks the expiration dates of various certification files, including the etcd, CA, and server certificate keys and certificates. It helps ensure that these certificates are not expired or about to expire, which is crucial for maintaining secure communication within the cluster. If any certificates are close to or past their expiration date, the command will alert you, allowing you to take appropriate action and renew or replace them.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: '[AI] `kubeadm certs check-expiration --cert-dir` is a command used to verify the expiration dates of various SSL/TLS certificates installed in the specified directory (--cert-dir) related to a Kubernetes cluster managed by `kubeadm`. This command helps ensure the security of the cluster by checking if any certificates are about to expire or have already expired. If an expiring certificate is found, it''s crucial to renew or replace them promptly to maintain secure communication within the cluster.'
        config: '[AI] `kubeadm certs check-expiration --config` is a command used with Kubernetes using `kubeadm`, which is a tool for installing and configuring a Kubernetes cluster. The `certs check-expiration` subcommand checks the expiration dates of various certificates within the provided Kubernetes configuration file, specified by `--config`. It outputs information about any certificates that are set to expire soon or have already expired. This command helps ensure the security and integrity of the cluster by maintaining up-to-date certificates.'
        kubeconfig: '[AI] `kubeadm certs check-expiration` is a command provided by Kubernetes'' `kubeadm` tool to verify the expiration dates of various SSL/TLS certificates used in a Kubernetes cluster for secure communication between different components. The `--kubeconfig` flag specifies the path to the Kubernetes configuration file which defines the location and details of your cluster. When you run this command, it will check the validity and expiration dates of the certificates such as client-ca.crt, ca.crt, service-ca.crt, and others, and output their statuses to help ensure secure communication within your cluster.'
