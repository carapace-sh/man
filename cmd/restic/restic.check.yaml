description: Check the repository for errors
flags:
    --check-unused: find unused blobs
    --read-data: read all data blobs
    --read-data-subset=: read a `subset` of data packs, specified as 'n/t' for specific subset or either 'x%' or 'x.y%' for random subset
    --with-cache: use the cache
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `restic check` is a command used in the data backup and synchronization tool `restic`. It''s used to verify the integrity of backups created with `restic`. The command reads the metadata of the backed-up files from the repository, compares it against the current file system state, and reports any differences. If no discrepancies are found, the backup is considered valid. This command ensures data consistency and helps prevent data loss.'
    flag:
        check-unused: '[AI] `restic check --check-unused` is a command used in the data backup tool called ''restic''. This command performs a consistency check on backups stored using restic. The `--check-unused` option specifically checks for and reports any files or directories that were backed up but are no longer present in the source directory. This helps ensure that only necessary data is being kept in the backup and can save storage space and improve backup performance.'
        read-data: '[AI] The `restic check --read-data` command is used in the data backup and sync tool, `restic`. This command is employed to verify the integrity of backed up data by reading data from the archive without extracting it. It''s a useful feature for confirming that the data remains intact without the need to restore or access the content itself. The process involves checking the metadata of the archived files and verifying their checksums against the originals. If the data matches, it indicates that the backup is error-free.'
        read-data-subset: |-
            [AI] The `restic check` command with the `--read-data-subset` option is used in restic, a backup program, to verify the integrity of data stored in backups.

            With this flag, restic reads and checks only a subset of the data from a specific backup. This is useful for performing selective data verification without having to read and check the entire backup. The `--read-data-subset` option takes a regular expression as its argument, which is used to filter the data to be verified.

            For instance, to verify only files with the .txt extension in a backup named "backup1", you can run:

            ```bash
            restic check backup1 --read-data-subset='.*\.txt$'
            ```
        with-cache: '[AI] `restic check` is a command from the backup tool "restic." The `--with-cache` option is used to instruct restic to perform a consistency check on both the data and the cache. The cache refers to the location where restic stores metadata about backups, such as filenames, checksums, and indexing information. By using `--with-check cache`, you ensure that the metadata stored in the cache is consistent with the actual data being backed up. This helps maintain data integrity and ensures that your backups can be restored correctly.'
