        [AI] The command "newrelic documentation" is not a standalone command as it is not something that can be typed directly into a terminal or command line interface. Instead, it refers to accessing the New Relic documentation resources.

        New Relic is a software analytics company that provides monitoring solutions for web and mobile applications. Their documentation can be found on their official website at <https://docs.newrelic.com>.

        To access the New Relic documentation:

        2. Browse through the different categories (e.g., APM, Browser, Infrastructure) to find the specific information you need.
        3. Use the search function at the top right corner of the page to quickly locate relevant content.
