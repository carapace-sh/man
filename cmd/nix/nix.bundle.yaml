documentation:
    command: '[AI] `nix-bundle` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It creates a self-contained, standalone archive (called a flake or a bundle) of one or more Nix expressions along with their dependencies. The output is a tarball that can be easily shared and run on other systems without requiring an existing Nix setup. This makes it convenient for distributing custom configurations or applications built using the Nix expression language.'
    flag:
        arg: '[AI] `nix bundle --arg` is a command in Nix packaging system used to create a self-contained, reproducible bundle of a Nix expression with custom arguments. The `--arg` option is used to pass key-value pairs as arguments to the expressed being bundled. These arguments can be used inside the Nix expression to configure its behavior. The resulting bundle is an archive that contains the expression, its dependencies, and the passed arguments, ensuring consistent build results across different environments.'
        argstr: '[AI] `nix-bundle` is a command-line utility provided by Nix Package Manager, which allows you to create bundles (self-contained, standalone packages) of outputs from Nix expressions or configurations. The `--argstr` option is used to pass arguments as strings to the expressions within the bundle. In other words, it lets you define custom arguments for the configuration or expression inside the bundle when building or installing. This can be useful to set variables or configure options that may differ between systems or users.'
        bundler: '[AI] `nix-bundle` is a command-line tool from the Nix Package Manager, used to create and manage self-contained, portable application bundles. The `--bundler` option specifies the name of a Nix expression or derived data (like a Flake) that defines the build environment and dependencies for the bundle. When you run `nix-bundle build <path-to-your-project> --bundler <Nix-expression>`, it will create a bundle with the specified configuration, including your project code and all its dependencies, ready to be easily transferred or executed in different environments.'
        commit-lock-file: '[AI] `nix-bundle` is a command in Nix package manager used to create a bundle, which is an archived collection of Nix expressions and their dependencies. The `--commit-lock-file` option generates or updates a commit-lock file along with the bundle. This file records the exact version of each dependency at the time of bundle creation, ensuring consistency across different environments when installing or building the bundled software from the archive.'
        debug: '[AI] `nix-bundle --debug` is a command in Nix Package Manager used for debugging bundles. A Nix bundle is a collection of packages and their configurations. The `--debug` flag enables detailed output during the bundle creation process, providing more information about each package being added and the build steps taken. This can help identify issues with dependencies or configuration settings.'
        debugger: '[AI] `nix-bundle --debugger` is a command provided by Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `--debugger` option launches the bundled application or service under the control of Nix''s built-in debugger. This allows users to attach common debugging tools like gdb (GNU Debugger) or lldb (LLVM Debugger) to the process for further analysis and troubleshooting. It provides a more detailed understanding of the application, its dependencies, and the environment in which it runs.'
        eval-store: '[AI] `nix-bundle --eval-store` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This command generates a Nix expression that can be used to evaluate and fetch specific build outputs or configurations from the Nix store, which is the central repository of precompiled packages managed by Nix. The evaluated expression is printed to standard output and can be used in other Nix expressions or commands for further processing or execution.'
        impure: '[AI] `nix-bundle --impure` is a command in Nix packaging system used to build and create a bundle, which is a self-contained archive, of an impure Nix expression. Impure expressions are those that depend on the external environment or have side effects during the build process. In contrast, pure expressions can be built reproducibly from their source code alone. The `--impure` flag tells Nix to allow building such impure expressions into a bundle.'
        include: '[AI] `nix-bundle --include` is a command in Nix Package Manager used to create a custom bundle of configurations, packages, and their dependencies. The `--include` option allows specifying a list of Nix expressions or package paths to include in the bundle. These included items are added to the default environment and become part of the resulting bundle. This command is useful for creating custom environments that have specific packages or configurations not available in the standard Nix channels.'
        inputs-from: '[AI] `nix bundle` is a Nix expression evaluation and bundling tool. The `--inputs-from` option specifies a file or a list of files from which to read input paths for the expressions to be evaluated. This allows you to easily manage dependencies between expressions and packages when creating a bundle. By providing a file with a list of inputs, you can ensure that all required components are included in the bundle without having to manually specify each one individually.'
        log-format: '[AI] `nix bundle` is a command-line tool from Nix Package Manager used to create a Nix expression bundles. The `--log-format` option specifies the format of the log output generated during the bundle creation process. By default, Nix uses JSON format for logs, but you can change it to plain text or other formats supported by the logging library used (currently Loggers from Pure and Spoon). Using this option can help tailor the log output to your needs when automating or debugging bundle creation.'
        no-registries: '[AI] `nix bundle --no-registries` is a command used in Nix packaging system to create a bundled Nix expression, which is a self-contained archive of a set of packages and their dependencies. The `--no-registries` option tells Nix not to fetch the dependencies from any external registries or caches but only use the locally available ones during the bundle creation process. This can be useful when you want to distribute a set of packages without relying on external sources, ensuring consistency and repeatability in the build environment.'
        no-update-lock-file: '[AI] `nix bundle` is a command-line tool from Nix package manager used to create an offline, self-contained bundle of Nix expressions. The `--no-update-lock-file` flag disables the creation of a lock file when building the bundle. Lock files help ensure reproducibility and consistency by recording the exact version of packages used during the build process. Without this flag, each build of the bundle may result in different sets of package versions being used.'
        no-write-lock-file: |-
            [AI] `nix-bundle` is a command-line utility provided by Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. The `--no-write-lock-file` option is used to prevent the creation of a write lock file when invoking this command.

            Write lock files are used to ensure that only one process can modify a given resource at any given time, preventing conflicts and data corruption. However, in some scenarios, such as continuous integration or automated build systems, it's desirable to skip the write lock check for performance reasons, as multiple processes may need to run the command concurrently.

            By using the `--no-write-lock-file` option, you can bypass this safety mechanism and run the `nix-bundle` command without waiting for a lock or creating a lock file. Be aware that using this flag comes with the risk of potential conflicts if multiple processes attempt to modify the same resource simultaneously.
        out-link: '[AI] `nix-bundle --out-link` is a command provided by Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command creates an output link instead of an actual bundled archive when running `nix-build` or `nix-store --dump-links`. The link points to the actual bundle in the Nix store, allowing users to easily symlink or reference the bundled outputs without having to move or copy the entire store path. This can be useful for deploying and managing applications in a consistent and isolated manner.'
        override-flake: '[AI] `nix-bundle` is a Nix package manager command used to create a custom, self-contained Nix expression or configuration file. The `--override-flake` option allows users to override specific aspects of existing Nix flakes (a Nix expression for managing multiple-package projects) without changing the original flake. By using `--override-flake`, users can create a new bundle that incorporates their modifications while keeping the base flake unaltered. This is particularly useful when collaborating on projects or when wanting to apply customizations without affecting the original setup.'
        override-input: |-
            [AI] `nix-bundle --override-input` is a command in Nix Package Manager used to create a new bundle or composition of packages, overriding inputs of specific packages with custom paths or values.

            When creating a new bundle, Nix looks for the required packages and their dependencies in the channels defined in your configuration file. With `--override-input`, you can modify the input (like source code URL, build output, etc.) of a specific package within the bundle. This is useful when you need to use a custom version or patch of a package that's not available in the default channels.

            The syntax is as follows: `nix-bundle build <bundle-name> --override-input <package-name>.<config-file>`. Here, replace `<bundle-name>` with the desired name for your bundle, `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to modify, and `<config-file>` with a file containing the custom input values.

            The config file should be in Nix expression format and define the `inputs.url`, `inputs.fetchFromHg`, or other relevant inputs for the package you're overriding. After running the command, Nix will create the bundle according to your specifications.
        print-build-logs: '[AI] `nix bundle --print-build-logs` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command generates build logs for a previously created Nix bundle, which is a self-contained snapshot of a software system along with its dependencies. By running this command, the user can view detailed information about how each component was built within the bundle, including any error messages or warnings that may have occurred during the build process. This can be helpful for debugging issues related to the bundle or understanding the provenance of the software it contains.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `nix-build` command with the `--quiet` flag is used in Nix Package Manager for building and installing software from a Nix expression or configuration file. The `--quiet` option suppresses the progress output during the build process, meaning that only error messages will be displayed if an issue arises during the build. This can be useful when automating builds or running multiple builds in parallel to keep the terminal output clean and focused on other information.'
        recreate-lock-file: '[AI] `nix-bundle --recreate-lock-file` is a command used in Nix packaging system. It generates or updates a lock file for a specific Nix expression or project. This lock file records the exact version of packages to be installed, ensuring reproducible builds and preventing version conflicts when building or deploying software.'
        update-input: '[AI] `nix-bundle --update-input` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command updates the input files of an existing Nix expression or configuration file without rebuilding the entire bundle or package. Input files can be dependencies that need to be updated to their latest versions while keeping the output unchanged. This helps to save time and resources by avoiding unnecessary rebuilds, especially when dealing with large projects.'
        verbose: '[AI] `nix-bundle --verbose` is a command in Nix Package Manager used to create a self-contained, portable bundle of Nix expressions and their dependencies. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output during the build process, providing more detailed information about each step of the build. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and understanding the build process in depth.'
