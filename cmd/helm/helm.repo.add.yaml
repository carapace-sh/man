description: add a chart repository
flags:
    --allow-deprecated-repos: by default, this command will not allow adding official repos that have been permanently deleted. This disables that behavior
    --ca-file=: verify certificates of HTTPS-enabled servers using this CA bundle
    --cert-file=: identify HTTPS client using this SSL certificate file
    --force-update: replace (overwrite) the repo if it already exists
    --insecure-skip-tls-verify: skip tls certificate checks for the repository
    --key-file=: identify HTTPS client using this SSL key file
    --no-update: Ignored. Formerly, it would disabled forced updates. It is deprecated by force-update.

    command: |-
        [AI] `helm repo add` is a command used in Helm, the Kubernetes Package Manager, to add new repositories (remote chart storages) to your local Helm repository catalog. The basic usage of this command is:

        ```bash
        helm repo add <REMOTE-NAME> <REMOTE-URL>
        ```

        Replace `<REMOTE-NAME>` with a descriptive name for the repository and `<REMOTE-URL>` with the URL of the remote chart repository. After executing this command, Helm will download and index the charts from that repository so they can be installed using Helm charts.
    flag:
        allow-deprecated-repos: '[AI] `helm repo add` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to add a new repository (a remote source of charts) to your local Helm repositories list. The `--allow-deprecated-repos` flag allows you to add repositories that may have been marked as deprecated, which means they''re no longer being actively maintained but still might contain useful charts. Use this flag with caution since using deprecated repositories could potentially lead to compatibility issues or security vulnerabilities.'
        ca-file: '[AI] `helm repo add` is a command used in Helm, the Kubernetes Package Manager, to add a new repository (also known as a chart repository) as a source for downloading Helm charts. The `--ca-file` option specifies the path to a file containing the CA (Certificate Authority) certificate, which is used to authenticate and verify the identity of the remote chart repository. This ensures secure communication between your local system and the remote chart repository.'
        cert-file: '[AI] `helm repo add` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to add a new repository (or chart repository) as a source for retrieving and installing Kubernetes charts. The `--cert-file` option is an argument provided with this command to specify the path to a client certificate file that will be used for TLS (Transport Layer Security) communication between Helm and the remote chart repository server. This is useful when connecting to a private or self-hosted chart repository that requires SSL/TLS authentication.'
        force-update: '[AI] `helm repo add` is a Helm command used to add or update a Helm repository in your local chart repository list. The `--force-update` flag forces Helm to overwrite any existing configuration for the repository, ensuring that you get the latest version of the charts from the repository. This can be useful if you suspect that your local Helm repositories are outdated or if you want to ensure that you''re using the most recent versions of specific charts.'
        insecure-skip-tls-verify: '[AI] `helm repo add` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to add a new repository (chart repository) as a source for chart deployments. The `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` flag is an optional argument that disables SSL certificate validation during communication with the specified chart repository. This means that Helm will not verify the authenticity of the SSL certificate presented by the repository, potentially allowing communication with an insecure or compromised server. It''s important to note that using this flag can pose a security risk and is generally discouraged unless necessary for specific use cases.'
        key-file: '[AI] `helm repo add` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to add a new repository (chart archive) to your local Helm repositories list. The `--key-file` option specifies the path to a private key file that can be used for authentication when adding a Helm repository hosted over HTTPS or other secure protocols. This is useful when accessing charts from an untrusted source, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the downloaded charts.'
        no-update: '[AI] `helm repo add` is a command used with Helm, the Kubernetes Package Manager, to add a new repository (also called a chart repository) as a source of pre-built charts for deployment. The `--no-update` flag that can be passed with this command prevents Helm from updating the index of the target repository after adding it. This means that the newly added repository will not have its latest charts downloaded and synced, allowing you to manually select which charts to install at a later time.'
        pass-credentials: '[AI] `helm repo add` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command is used to add a new repository (or chart repository) to Helm''s charts repository list. The `--pass-credentials` flag is an optional argument for this command. It specifies that Helm should use the current context''s authentication credentials (e.g., from `kubeconfig`) when interacting with the added repository. This allows users to access private repositories containing charts without having to manually configure authentication each time they install or upgrade charts.'
        password: '[AI] `helm repo add` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to add a new repository (or chart repository) as a source for installing and upgrading charts. The `--password` flag is an option that allows you to specify a password for authentication when adding a private Git or other version control repositories as Helm repositories. This ensures secure access to the repository contents when using Helm for managing your Kubernetes applications.'
        username: '[AI] The `helm repo add` command is used to add a Helm repository, which is a remote source for Helm charts, to your local Helm configuration. The `--username` option is for providing your Helm Hub username when adding a repository that requires authentication. This ensures that you can access the repository''s charts and upgrade or install them using Helm.'
