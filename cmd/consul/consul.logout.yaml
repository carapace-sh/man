documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul logout` command is used in Consul, a popular service discovery and configuration management tool, to end an ongoing session for security reasons. It helps ensure that unauthorized access to your Consul server does not occur by terminating any active sessions originating from a specific client or user. This command is typically used when you suspect a security breach or when a user leaves the organization.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] The `consul logout` command is used to revoke access tokens and sign out a Consul client from a Hashicorp Consul server. The option `--ca-file <FILE>` specifies the path to a file containing the PEM-encoded CA certificate that was used to authenticate the Consul client with the server. Providing this flag ensures that the client is using a trusted certificate for secure communication during logout.'
        ca-path: '[AI] `consul logout` is a command used in the Consul service discovery and configuration tool to revoke tokens, which are used for authentication and access control. The `--ca-path` option specifies the path to a CA (Certificate Authority) file when using TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates for secure communication between Consul nodes. This flag ensures that only trusted certificates are accepted during logout operations, adding an extra layer of security to the process.'
        client-cert: '[AI] The `consul logout` command with the `--client-cert` flag is used to revoke and remove a specific client certificate from Consul''s Key Value Store or HTTP API. This action is typically performed to securely terminate an application or service''s access to a Consul server when it is no longer needed, ensuring that unauthorized access is prevented. The client certificate must be provided along with the command for successful revocation.'
        client-key: '[AI] The `consul logout` command is used in Hashicorp''s Consul service to revoke access for a specific client with the given `--client-key`. When this command is executed, Consul will remove the authentication key from its client token pool and terminate any active sessions associated with that key. This ensures that unauthorized access to the Consul service is prevented.'
        datacenter: '[AI] The `consul logout` command is used in Hashicorp''s Consul service to terminate a token session and log out from a specific datacenter in the Consul cluster. When you include the `--datacenter` option followed by the name of a datacenter, it specifies that you want to log out only from that particular datacenter. This is useful when managing tokens across multiple datacenters in a Consul deployment.'
        http-addr: '[AI] The `consul logout` command is used to log out from a Consul CLI session. The `--http-addr` option specifies the HTTP address of the Consul server, which helps the client identify and connect to the correct server instance when logging back in. For example, if your Consul server is running at `localhost:8501`, you would use the command `consul logout --http-addr localhost:8501` to log out while preserving this connection information.'
        stale: '[AI] The `consul logout --stale` command is used in Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool by Hashicorp. It forcibly logs out any stale sessions that have been idle for an extended period. These sessions may no longer be required or could pose a security risk if they belong to former team members or terminated services. The `--stale` flag ensures the removal of these sessions without waiting for their natural expiration, providing an extra layer of security and cleanup in a Consul environment.'
        tls-server-name: '[AI] The `consul logout --tls` command is used to log out from a Consul cluster session secured with Transport Layer Security (TLS). The `--tls-server-name` option specifies the TLS server name or certificate to authenticate against when making the logout request. This ensures that only the intended Consul server accepts the logout command, adding an additional layer of security.'
        token: '[AI] The `consul logout` command with the `--token` option is used to revoke access to a Consul service or key-value store for a specific token in the Hashicorp Consul configuration management tool. When this command is executed, Consul invalidates the given token, preventing any further use of it and ensuring that only authenticated requests with valid tokens can access the managed resources.'
        token-file: '[AI] `consul logout` is a command used in the Consul service discovery and configuration tool. The `--token-file` flag is an option for this command, specifying a file containing a Consul token to be used for logging out. This command is utilized when it''s necessary to revoke access associated with that token. Once executed, the specified Consul token will no longer be able to make API requests to the Consul server.'
