documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vagrant snapshot restore` is a Vagrant command used to restore a previously saved state of a virtual machine. When you save a snapshot, all running processes and any changes made since the last snapshot are frozen. Restoring a snapshot brings the VM back to that saved state. This can be useful for quickly returning a VM to a known working configuration or for creating repeatable environments.'
    flag:
        no-provision: '[AI] The `vagrant snapshot restore` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machines, to restore a previous state of a VM from a saved snapshot. The `--no-provision` option disables the provisioning process during restoration. Provisioning is the process of applying configurations or installing software on a freshly created or restored VM using provisioners like Shell scripts, Puppet, Chef, etc. By using `--no-provision`, you can restore the VM to the saved state without running any provisions.'
        no-start: '[AI] The `vagrant snapshot restore` command in Vagrant is used to restore a previously saved state of a virtual machine (VM) or container. The `--no-start` option prevents the VM or container from being started after the snapshot is restored. This means that you can revert your environment back to a specific point in time without affecting any currently running processes. It''s often used when troubleshooting issues, as it allows you to analyze the state of the system at a given moment.'
        provision: |-
            [AI] The `vagrant snapshot restore --provision` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments, to restore a previous state of a Virtual Machine (VM) while also running provisioning scripts.

            When you create a snapshot with the `vagrant snapshot save` command, Vagrant saves the current state of your VM, including its filesystem and running processes, as well as any configured shared folders or network settings.

            The `vagrant snapshot restore` command allows you to revert back to a previously saved snapshot, which can be useful for debugging or testing different configurations of your application. By adding the `--provision` flag, Vagrant will also execute any provisioning scripts that were defined in your Vagrantfile when the snapshot was taken, ensuring that your VM is fully configured with the latest dependencies and settings upon restoration.
        provision-with: |-
            [AI] The `vagrant snapshot restore --provision-with` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machines, to restore a previous state of a VM from a saved snapshot while also running any provisioning scripts during the process.

            Provisioning scripts are configurations or customizations that get executed after the VM is created or rebooted. The `--provision-with` option ensures these scripts run when restoring a snapshot, maintaining consistency with the current state of the VM.
