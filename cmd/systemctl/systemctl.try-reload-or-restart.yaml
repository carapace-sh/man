documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl try-reload-or-restart` is a command used in Linux systems with systemd init system. It attempts to perform either a reload or a restart of a specified service, depending on its current state. If the service can be reloaded without disrupting the system, it will be reloaded. However, if a reload is not possible or does not resolve the issue, then the service will be restarted instead. This command provides a convenient way to safely try and rectify any issues with services while minimizing disruption to the system.'
