documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `fold` command is a Unix utility used to apply a function to the lines of files, reducing them into a single line or a sequence of lines with the result delimited by a specified separator. It reads input line by line and applies an operation (specified as a function) on each line''s contents and the accumulated result from the previous line(s), producing an output in the form of one or more lines. This command is typically used for data processing, text manipulation, or data aggregation tasks.'
    flag:
        bytes: '[AI] The `fold --bytes=N` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to fold or split text data into lines of exactly `N` bytes each. It reads input from standard input or a file, and outputs the folded lines to standard output. This can be useful for working with large binary files or for formatting text for specific width requirements. The option `--bytes=N` sets the byte length `N` for each line.'
        help: '[AI] The `fold` command in Unix-based systems is used to fold long lines into shorter lines, maintaining the original line wrapping at specified intervals. The option `--help` displays a brief help message about how to use the `fold` command, including valid options and their descriptions. It is typically invoked as `fold --help` in the terminal.'
        spaces: '[AI] The `fold --spaces=N` command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems is used to fold or wrap long lines of text into N character-wide segments, with each segment ending in a space instead of a line break. This can be helpful for formatting large output, such as code listings or logs, to fit within the width of a terminal window or printout. The default value for N is typically 80 characters, but it can be specified explicitly by the user with the `--spaces` option followed by the desired number.'
        version: '[AI] `fold` is a text processing utility in Unix-like operating systems. The `--version` option is used to display the version information of the installed `fold` application, including its name, version number, and sometimes other details like compilation date or author. This command helps users check which version of `fold` they are using for potential compatibility issues with specific input data or other software.'
        width: '[AI] The `fold --width` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to fold or wrap long lines of text into narrower widths, ensuring that they fit within a specified number of columns. The `--width` option sets the maximum column width for wrapping lines. For example, `fold -w 70 file.txt` would wrap all lines in `file.txt` to be no longer than 70 characters.'
