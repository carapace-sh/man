    command: '[AI] `flutter clean` is a command-line tool for the Flutter framework used to remove derived files and cached data from the project directory. It helps in cleaning up unnecessary files, reducing disk space usage, and improving build performance by rebuilding the project from scratch. The command eliminates the "lib-cache" and ".dart_tool" directories, emptying the build cache and invalidating old analysis results. After running `flutter clean`, you can use `flutter pub get` to fetch the latest dependencies before building your application.'
