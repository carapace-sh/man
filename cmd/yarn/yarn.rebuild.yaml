documentation:
    command: '[AI] `yarn rebuild` is a command used with Yarn, a popular package manager for JavaScript projects. This command performs several tasks: it first checks the existing lockfile and installs any missing or updated dependencies based on the package.json file. Then, it compiles and builds the source code of the project using preset build scripts specified in the package.json under the "scripts" section, typically "build" script. The result is usually a production-ready bundle or an artifact ready for deployment.'
