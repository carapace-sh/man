documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vagrant upload` is a Vagrant command used to copy files and directories from a running Vagrant box to a local or remote file server. It uses SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) by default, but other methods like WinSCP or SFTP can be configured. The syntax is typically `vagrant upload <source> <destination>`, where `<source>` specifies the path of files or directories to be copied from the box and `<destination>` specifies the remote directory where they will be placed. This command is useful when you want to share files between your local development environment and the Vagrant box, or when you need to distribute files between multiple instances of the same box.'
    flag:
        compress: '[AI] `vagrant upload --compress` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command compresses and transfers files or directories from the local development environment to the provisioned remote Vagrant machine. By default, Vagrant uses SSH for file transfer. The `--compress` option enables data compression during the transfer process, which can help reduce bandwidth usage and save time when transferring large files.'
        compression-type: '[AI] The `vagrant upload` command is used to transfer files or directories from a Vagrant-managed virtual machine to the local machine. The option `--compression-type` specifies the type of compression algorithm to use when transferring the files. The possible values are "gzip" (default) or "none". If set to "gzip", the transferred files will be compressed using gzip before being uploaded, reducing the size of the data transferred over the network. If set to "none", no compression will be applied and the original file sizes will be preserved during the transfer.'
        temporary: '[AI] `vagrant upload --temporary` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for managing virtual machines and development environments. This command allows users to upload files or directories from their local machine to the running Vagrant box as temporary files. The uploaded files are not stored persistently on the box but are available during the current session. This can be useful for sharing large files or transferring configuration files for testing purposes, without having to install them permanently on the virtual machine.'
