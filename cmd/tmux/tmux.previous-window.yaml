documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux previous-window` command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, is used to switch to the previously active window within the current TMUX session. This allows users to easily cycle through their open windows without having to remember the exact order or layout of their sessions.'
    flag:
        a: '[AI] The `tmux` command `previous-window -a` is used to switch to the preceding window in a tmux session. The `-a` option stands for "adjacent," meaning it will cycle through the windows in order, wrapping around from the last window back to the first. So, if you have multiple windows open and use this command repeatedly, it will allow you to quickly navigate between them.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux previous-window -t` is a command used in the tmux terminal multiplexer to switch to the previously active window in the current tab. The `-t` option allows specifying the target window or pane by its named session or window ID, if there are multiple windows with the same name in the current tab. If no target is specified, tmux defaults to the previous window in the order of usage.'
