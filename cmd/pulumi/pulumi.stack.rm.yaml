documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pulumi stack rm` is a command used in Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform, for removing a specific stack (a collection of resources) from your Pulumi project. When executed, it deletes all the resources defined within that stack configuration file, along with their associated state. This command should be used carefully, as it permanently removes the resources and their data from your infrastructure.'
