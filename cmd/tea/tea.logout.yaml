    command: '[AI] The `tea logout` command is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It seems to be specific to the TEA (Terminal Emulation Administration) software, which is used for managing terminal sessions in a networked environment. This command is used by the TEA client to terminate an active terminal session and disconnect from the server.'
