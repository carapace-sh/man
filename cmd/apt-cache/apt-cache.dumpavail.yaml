description: prints out an available list to stdout
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `apt-cache dumpavail` is a command used with the APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) software in Debian and Ubuntu based Linux distributions. It generates a list of available packages and their versions along with their sizes and checksums, which can be saved to a file for offline use or for other systems. This command is helpful when dealing with limited bandwidth or unreliable internet connections. The output can then be used with `apt-get` or similar tools to install the packages from the local cache without requiring an online connection.'
