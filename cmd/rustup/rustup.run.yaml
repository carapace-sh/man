        [AI] `rustup run` is a Rust package manager command used to execute a given command within a specified Rust toolchain. It allows you to isolate your project's dependencies from your global Rust environment, ensuring consistency and avoiding potential version conflicts. The general syntax is:

        ```sh
        rustup run <toolchain> <command>
        ```

        Replace `<toolchain>` with the name or the path to the toolchain you want to use, and replace `<command>` with the command you intend to execute. For example, if you have multiple Rust versions installed and you want to check the documentation for a specific package using a specific Rust version, you can use:

        ```sh
        rustup run <toolchain-name> rustdoc <package-name>
        ```

            [AI] `rustup run` is a sub-command of Rust's package manager, `rustup`. It allows users to run scripts written in Rust or other languages with specified toolchains. The `--help` option provides detailed information about the usage and available flags for `rustup run`. Here are some key points:

            * Takes a script path as an argument
            * Runs the script using the specified toolchain
            * Supports multiple toolchains (Rust, Cargo, etc.)
            * Provides options to pass arguments to the script and specify environment variables.

            Example usage: `rustup run myscript.rs --toolchain nightly`.
        install: '[AI] `rustup run --install` is a command used in Rust programming language''s package manager, `rustup`.
