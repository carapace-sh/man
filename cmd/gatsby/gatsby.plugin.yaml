documentation:
    command: '[AI] "Gatsby plugin" refers to a package that can be used in the Gatsby JavaScript framework for building static websites or apps. Plugins extend the functionality of Gatsby by adding new capabilities, such as data sources, transformations, or optimization techniques. They are implemented as Node.js modules and can be easily installed using npm or Yarn, then configured within the `gatsby-config.js` file. This allows developers to build more powerful and customized projects without having to write complex code from scratch.'
