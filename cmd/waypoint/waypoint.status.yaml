documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint status` command in GPS navigation systems or software provides information about the currently defined waypoints, including their names, coordinates (latitude and longitude), and sometimes other relevant details such as the bearing or distance to each waypoint from the current position. This command can be used to check on the status of waypoints during a journey for navigation purposes.'
    flag:
        all-projects: '[AI] `waypoint status --all-projects` is a command used in Google Cloud''s Waypoint configuration management tool. It returns the current status of all projects'' Waypoint installations under your account. Each project''s output includes its name, version, and whether it''s healthy or experiencing issues. The command helps users keep track of their multi-project Waypoint environments.'
        app: '[AI] The `waypoint status --app` command is used in Docker Swarm to check the current status of applications deployed within a Swarm cluster. This command returns detailed information about each service, including its replicas, their current health status, network ports, and other relevant details. It helps users monitor the state of their applications in the cluster and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.'
        json: '[AI] `waypoint status --json` is a command used in Google Cloud Platform''s Kubernetes Engine to retrieve the current status of all waypoints in a Canary or Blue-Green deployment. Waypoints are intermediate release stages between production and the main branch, allowing gradual rollouts of updates. The `--json` flag returns the output in JSON format, providing detailed information on each waypoint''s name, current version, desired version, progress, and status (running, ready, or failed).'
        plain: '[AI] The `waypoint status --plain` command in Kubernetes is used to display the current status of all Waypoints (canaries or preview releases) in a simple text format. Waypoints are a feature of the Canary Infrastructure controller, which allows for gradual rollouts and rollbacks of applications. The output shows each waypoint''s name, namespace, desired and current replica count, available capacity, and the status of the deployment (e.g., ready, failed, or pending).'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint status --project` command is used in Google Cloud Platform''s Kubernetes management tool, Waypoint, to display the current status of all resources (such as deployments, services, and replica sets) across all projects within a given Google Cloud account. By running this command with the `--project` flag followed by the specific project ID, you can filter the output to only show the resources in that particular project. This can help provide an overview of the current state of your infrastructure in that project.'
        refresh: '[AI] `waypoint status --refresh` is a command used in Kubernetes to update the display of the current state of all Waypoints in a cluster. Waypoints are a type of custom resource definition (CRD) in Kubernetes that allow for canary deployments, where new versions of an application are gradually rolled out to a fraction of the traffic. The `--refresh` flag forces the command to re-fetch and display the most up-to-date information from the Kubernetes API server.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `waypoint status --verbose` command is used in Kubernetes to retrieve detailed information about the current state of all waypoints in a given GitOps syncer or controller, such as Flagger or Jenkins X. Waypoints represent desired states for deployments and other resources in a Git repository, which are synchronized with the live cluster through continuous delivery workflows. The `--verbose` flag increases the output level, providing more comprehensive information about each waypoint''s status, including its name, namespace, revision, and syncing progress.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint status --workspace` command in Kubernetes is used to display the current status of all workloads, deployments, and stateful sets in a specific Waypoint workspace. Waypoint is an open-source GitOps operator for Kubernetes that helps manage applications through declarative configuration files stored in Git repositories. By using this command, you can quickly check if your desired configuration has been applied correctly to your running clusters and identify any potential discrepancies or issues between the desired and current state.'
