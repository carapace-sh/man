documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker trust` command is not a valid Docker command. There is no such command in the official Docker CLI (Command Line Interface) tools. You may be confusing it with other Docker-related commands or concepts, such as `docker login` (used to log in to a Docker registry), `docker pull` (used to download an image from a registry), or `docker build` trusting external sources for base images or dependencies. If you meant one of these commands, please provide more context for a correct answer.'
