        [AI] The `jj` command is not a standard Git command. It seems you might be using a custom tool or alias built on top of Git, as `jj` is the name of a popular Java IDE.

        The `branch list` part of your command could be referring to listing all branches in a Git repository. If that's the case, the correct Git command would be `git branch`. This command shows both local and remote branches, with an asterisk (*) symbol representing the currently checked-out branch. To see only local branches, use `git branch --list` instead.
    flag:
        all: '[AI] The Git command `jj branch list --all` displays a list of all local and remote branches in your Git repository. The `--all` option includes both tracking and non-tracking branches, providing a comprehensive view of all available branches within the repository.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `jj branch list --help` is a command used in the Jira CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, specifically the `jj` utility. This command displays help information about the `branch list` sub-command.

            In simple terms, `jj branch list` lists all branches under a repository, and adding `--help` to the command provides detailed information on how to use this specific command effectively. This includes options like `--max-pages`, `--per-page`, and `--columns` that can be used to customize the output format of the command. It also explains how to filter branches by name or branch type, and how to sort them alphabetically, numerically, or by last updated time.
        revisions: '[AI] `jj branch list --revisions` is a Git command used with the JJ Agg tool, which is a text-based graph visualization tool for Git repositories. This specific command generates a list of revisions or commit hashes for each branch in your Git repository. The output includes the branch name and the corresponding commit hash, making it easier to identify the latest commits on each branch.'
