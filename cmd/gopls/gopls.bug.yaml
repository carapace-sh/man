        [AI] The `gopls bug` command is not a valid or recognized command in Go, as it seems to be missing important context. `gopls` is an extension for the Go programming language that provides features such as autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and debugging within popular code editors like Visual Studio Code. The term "bug" typically refers to an error or issue in software.

        If you meant to report a bug with `gopls`, you would follow these steps instead:

        1. Identify the problem: Isolate the specific issue, and provide clear details about what's wrong, including reproduction steps.
        2. Search for existing issues: Check if someone else has reported a similar issue in the `gopls` GitHub repository (https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls).
        3. File a new bug report: If you can't find an existing issue, file a new one with the details of your problem and any relevant code snippets on the `gopls` GitHub repository. Make sure to include enough information for the developers to understand and reproduce the issue.
