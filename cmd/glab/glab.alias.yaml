        [AI] `glab alias` is a GitLab CLI command used to create or manage aliases for frequently used Git commands, repository URLs, or branches. Alias configuration makes it easier and more convenient to interact with your GitLab repositories by defining shorthand names for common actions. To use the command, specify an alias name followed by the command, URL, or branch you want to alias. For example:

        ```bash
        glab alias gs get situational-awareness git fetch --all --prune --unshallow
        ```

        This sets up an alias named `gs` for a Git fetch command with additional flags. To list your existing aliases, use the command without any arguments:

        ```bash
        glab alias
        ```
