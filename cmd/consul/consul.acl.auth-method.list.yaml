documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method list` command is used in Hashicorp Consul to retrieve a list of available authentication methods for Access Control Lists (ACL). These authentication methods determine how Consul verifies the identity of clients and agents before granting access to resources. Common examples include Token, Certificate, and Userpass. Knowing which authentication methods are configured can help in managing security policies within the Consul environment.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] `consul acl auth-method list --ca-file` is a command used with Hashicorp''s Consul service, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command lists the authentication methods configured under Access Control Lists (ACL) in Consul, specifically those using x.509 certificates for authentication. The `--ca-file` option specifies the path to a file containing the CA (Certificate Authority) certificate used for validating the presented x.509 certificates during the authentication process.'
        ca-path: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method list --ca-path` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This specific command lists the authentication methods configured under Access Control Lists (ACL) in Consul, filtering the results to only show those with a Certificate Authority (CA) path set. The CA path is the location of the trusted root certificate authorities used to validate the authenticity of SSL/TLS certificates presented by clients during the authentication process. This command helps in managing and securing access to services and configuration data in Consul using different authentication methods based on their CA certificates.'
        client-cert: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method list --client-cert` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This specific command lists the client certificates configured as authentication methods for Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Consul. Client certificates are used to authenticate and authorize requests to Consul''s HTTP API, ensuring secure communication between clients and the Consul server.'
        client-key: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl auth-method list --client-key` command is used with the Consul Access Control List (ACL) tool to retrieve a list of authentication methods and their corresponding client keys. Consul is an open-source, distributed, and easy-to-use solution to connect and secure services.

            The `auth-method` subcommand lists all the configured authentication methods in your Consul installation. The `--client-key` flag filters the output to only show the authentication methods along with their associated client keys. Client keys are unique identifiers that must be provided by clients when authenticating with Consul using a specific authentication method.

            In summary, this command returns information about the available authentication methods in your Consul installation and their corresponding client keys.
        datacenter: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method list --datacenter` command is used with Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This specific command lists the authentication methods configured under Access Control Lists (ACL) in a Consul datacenter. It does not provide details about each method but returns their names only.'
        format: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl` command is a tool for managing access control lists (ACLs) in Hashicorp's Consul service discovery and configuration management platform. The specific command `consul acl auth-method list --format` is used to list all available authentication methods that can be used to secure Consul's HTTP API.

            The `--format` flag specifies the output format for the command, which in this case is not explicitly stated but typically defaults to JSON or tabular format when omitted. The result will be a list of authentication methods, each including essential information such as name and description.
        http-addr: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method list --http-addr` command is used with the Hashicorp Consul service, which is a distributed, highly available, and data center aware toolkit for configuring and managing modern infrastructure. This specific command is utilized to list the authentication methods that are currently configured for Consul''s Access Control List (ACL) system. The `--http-addr` flag specifies the HTTP address of the Consul server or client to connect to. By executing this command, users can view a list of the available authentication methods, such as Token, X-Token, TLS, and others, which can be used to securely authenticate requests to Consul''s ACL API.'
        meta: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method list --meta` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command lists the available authentication methods in the Access Control List (ACL) of Consul along with their associated metadata. Metadata refers to key-value pairs that can be attached to the authentication method to provide additional information. The output of this command helps users understand what authentication methods are supported, and what data they can expect from each one.'
        namespace: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method list --namespace` command is used in Consul, a Connective and Config Management platform, to list the available authentication methods within a specific namespace for Access Control Lists (ACL). This command does not take any arguments except for the namespace which is specified after the `--namespace` flag. The output will display the name of each authentication method, providing information on how they are configured and managed for securing access to resources in Consul.'
        stale: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method list --stale` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command lists the authentication methods currently configured in Access Control List (ACL) mode, including those that may have been previously removed but not yet fully cleaned up from the system (stale entries). By using the `--stale` flag, you can see a more complete list of all authentication methods that have ever been configured.'
        tls-server-name: '[AI] The `consul acl auth-method list --tls-server-name` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This specific command lists the authentication methods configured for Access Control Lists (ACL) in Consul, filtered by the TLS server name. In simpler terms, it shows the various authentication strategies that are enabled for securing ACL access, specifically those using a TLS server name for identification.'
        token: '[AI] The command `consul acl auth-method list --token` is used in Consul, an open-source distributed computing platform, to retrieve a list of authentication methods currently configured for Access Control Lists (ACL). The `--token` flag is used to authenticate the request with a valid Consul token. This command helps in understanding the different authentication mechanisms implemented and managing access control in a Consul environment.'
        token-file: '[AI] The command `consul acl auth-method list --token-file` is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source multi-purpose service discovery, configuration, and orchestration tool. This command specifically lists the authentication methods currently configured for Access Control Lists (ACL) in Consul using a token file for secure access. The `--token-file` argument is used to specify the path to a Consul Connect token file that grants the necessary permissions to execute this command.'
