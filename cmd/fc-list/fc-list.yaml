documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `fc-list` command is a tool in the Font Configuation (fc-cache and fc-query) utility package for Linux systems. It lists all installed fonts along with their names, families, and sizes. Users can use this command to view and manage available fonts on their system for applications like text editors or graphic design software.'
    flag:
        brief: '[AI] `fc-list --brief` is a command used in the GNOME desktop environment for managing keyboard shortcuts and custom keybindings. The `--brief` option causes the output to be displayed in a concise format, showing only the name of each shortcut or binding and the corresponding keys or keysym symbols. This can be useful when you need an overview of all your shortcuts without the extra information provided by other more verbose output formats.'
        format: '[AI] `fc-list --format` is a command from the `fontconfig` library used in Linux and other Unix-like systems for managing fonts. The `--format` option specifies the output format of the command, which determines how the information about available fonts is displayed. By default, `fc-list` prints a list of all installed fonts with their respective names and paths. However, using the `--format` option allows customizing this output to fit specific needs. For instance, one could use `fc-list --format=''"%{family} %{weight} %{slant} %{version}"''` to display only the family, weight, slant, and version of each font.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `fc-list` is a command-line utility tool in the `glibc-utils` package, commonly used with the GNOME desktop environment. Its primary function is to display information about currently defined color schemes and aliases for various terminal applications.

            The option `--help` is used to display detailed help information about the `fc-list` command itself. It provides an overview of available commands and their usage, as well as details on each option and its purpose. This can be useful when needing to remember how to use `fc-list`, or for discovering new features and options that may not be immediately obvious from regular usage.
        quiet: '[AI] `fc-list --quiet` is a command used in GNU Screen and GTK+ application "Gnome Terminal" for listing active sessions or windows, but with the `--quiet` option it only displays their names without any extra information such as IDs or flags. The output is intended for scripting purposes and is typically processed by other programs rather than being displayed in a terminal.'
        verbose: '[AI] `fc-list --verbose` is a command used in GNOME desktop environment''s `font-config` package to list all the installed fonts with detailed information. The `--verbose` option increases the output''s verbosity, providing extra details like font family names, full names, styles, weights, and sizes for each font file. This can be useful when troubleshooting font-related issues or managing complex font configurations.'
        version: '[AI] `fc-list --version` is a command used in the GNOME Desktop environment for managing and displaying keyboard shortckeys (also known as "function keys") and their associated actions. The `--version` option is used to display the version number of the `fc-list` utility itself, providing information on which release or build it is running.'
