        F: '[AI] `tmux list-buffers` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer that lists the names or numbers of the available session buffers. The `-F` option is used to customize the output format. In this case, no specific format is specified, so the default output will be the buffer index and the name of the window or session associated with each buffer. If a more complex format string is provided, it can be used to display additional information such as the creation time or the process group ID of each buffer.'
        f: '[AI] `tmux list-buffers -f` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that lists the names or numbers of all available session buffers. The `-f` option makes Tmux output each buffer name on a new line, providing a clear and concise view of the available buffers. This can be useful for quickly checking which buffers exist within a given Tmux session.'
