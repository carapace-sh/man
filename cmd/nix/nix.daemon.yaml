    command: '[AI] The `nix daemon` is a background service in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It manages the build and configuration of software packages using the Nix expression language. The daemon constantly checks for updates to installed packages and their dependencies, and automatically downloads, compiles, and installs them as needed. Users can interact with it through the `nix-env` command line tool or by configuring their system to use Nix as a package manager.'
