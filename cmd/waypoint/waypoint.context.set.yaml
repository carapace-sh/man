documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint context set` command in Terraform is used to define or update the context for a specific Waypoint module configuration. Contexts allow users to customize module behavior by providing inputs that overrides the default values. This command sets the value of one or more context variables, enabling fine-grained control over how the module is applied within a Terraform configuration.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `waypoint context set --app` command is used in Kubernetes to update the current working context in the kubectl CLI (Kubernetes Command Line Interface) with details of a specific application or deployment. It sets the context with the name and namespace of the app, making it easier for users to manage and deploy resources related to that application. This command is helpful when managing multiple applications across different namespaces in a Kubernetes cluster.'
        plain: '[AI] `waypoint context set --plain` is a command used in the Kubernetes toolset, specifically with the `kubectl` utility. It sets the current context of your Kubernetes configuration to a named context without displaying any output or prompting for confirmation. The `--plain` flag means that no extra information is displayed when switching contexts.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint context set --project` command is used in the Waypoint configuration management tool to set the current project context for your local environment. Waypoint manages multiple projects and their respective configurations, and this command allows you to switch between them by specifying the desired project name. This enables you to work on different projects with distinct configurations while keeping your context clear.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint context set --workspace` command is used in Google Cloud''s Waypoint tool to set the active workspace for managing Kubernetes resources. It allows users to switch between different working directories or projects, each with its own distinct set of configurations and resource deployments. This command helps manage and maintain separate environments or applications within a single Waypoint installation.'
