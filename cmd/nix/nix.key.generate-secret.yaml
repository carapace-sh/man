documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nix-key generate-secret` command is used to create a new secret key in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This command generates a new RSA key pair for use with Nix''s built-in GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) support, with the secret key being encrypted using a passphrase for added security. The public key is then automatically stored in your Nix profile, allowing you to authenticate and sign packages installed or built with Nix.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `nix-key` is a command-line tool for managing NixOS keys, which are used to authenticate and encrypt communication with NixOS systems. The command `nix key generate-secret --debug` generates a new secret key for a NixOS identity and prints debug information during the process. This includes details about the generated key pair, such as their public and private components and their fingerprints. By using the `--debug` flag, more extensive output is provided to help with troubleshooting or for those who want a deeper understanding of the key generation process.'
        key-name: '[AI] The command `nix-key generate-secret --key-name` is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This command generates a new cryptographic secret key with the specified name `--key-name`. The generated key is encrypted and can be used to authenticate and encrypt communications with Nix expression servers or other Nix users.'
        log-format: '[AI] The `nix-key` generation command with the `--generate-secret` option creates a new Nix expression for generating a cryptographic secret key, while `--log-format` specifies the format for logging output. The log messages will be printed in the specified format during the key generation process.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] The command `nix-key generate-secret --print-build-logs` is used to generate a new Nix key, which is a GPG key specifically designed for use with the Nix package manager. The option `--generate-secret` generates a new secret key and stores it in the Nix store, while `--print-build-logs` prints the build logs during the key generation process to the console. This can be helpful for debugging any potential issues that may arise during the key creation.'
        quiet: '[AI] The command `nix-key generate-secret --quiet` is used to generate a new Nix cryptographic key in quiet mode, meaning it will not display progress messages during the key generation process. This command creates a new encryption key for managing and verifying Nix expressions and channels using Nix''s built-in key management tools.'
        verbose: '[AI] The command `nix-key generate-secret --verbose` is used to generate a new NixOS encryption key with increased verbosity. NixOS uses GPG keys for managing and verifying the authenticity of configuration changes and package installations. This command generates a new secret key, which should be stored securely and kept confidential. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output displayed during the key generation process to provide more detailed information about what is happening.'
