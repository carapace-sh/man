documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea releases list` command is used in the TeaVM (The Virtual Machine for the JVM bytecode) environment to display a list of available TeaVM release versions. It helps users to check which versions are currently available, and they can use this information to manage their TeaVM installation or upgrade process.'
    flag:
        limit: '[AI] The `tea releases list --limit` command is used in the TeaDB database management tool for PostgreSQL to retrieve a specific number of latest release records from the Teapub repository. The `--limit` option sets the maximum number of results returned by the command, enabling users to limit the output and get only the required information.'
        login: '[AI] The `--login` option in the `tea releases list` command is used with the Tea CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for managing Helm releases using the Teapot package manager. This option authenticates the client by opening a new terminal window and prompting for login credentials to authenticate against a Tiltfile or other Helm repository, allowing you to install and manage Helm releases securely.'
        output: '[AI] The `--output` flag used with the `tea releases list` command in Tea (a package manager for Go) specifies how the output of the command should be formatted. By default, the command lists the available releases in a table format. However, you can use the `--output json` option to get the output in JSON format, or `--output text` for plain text output. The exact format of the output depends on the chosen option.'
        page: '[AI] The `--page` option in the `tea releases list` command is used to specify the page number of the result set returned by the Tea CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. This option allows users to navigate through multiple pages of releases, each containing a maximum number of items, which is configurable via the `--per-page` option. The first page is numbered 1.'
        remote: '[AI] `--remote` is an option used with the Git command `teal releases list`. It fetches the list of release branches or tags from a remote repository instead of the local one. This can be useful when working on multiple repositories or when dealing with large projects where fetching the entire history might not be feasible. The output will display the name, tag/branch, and commit message for each release.'
        repo: '[AI] The `tea releases list --repo` command is used with Tea, a package manager for Go language. This command lists all available releases in the specified repository. The `--repo` option specifies the name of the repository to query. It provides information about the packages and their versions that are available for installation or updating in that repository.'
