    command: |-
        [AI] `gh issue create` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new issue in a specific repository. It requires providing essential details such as the repository name or URL, a title for the issue, and an optional description. The syntax is typically: `gh issue create [REPO_NAME] [ISSUE_TITLE] --description "[DESCRIPTION]"`

        For instance, to create a new issue in the "myproject" repository with the title "Fix a bug in file1.js" and a description "The test in test1.js fails when file1.js is updated", you would run: `gh issue create myproject Fix a bug in file1.js --description "The test in test1.js fails when file1.js is updated"`

For example, `gh issue create --title "Bug in feature X" --body "Description of bug here" --assignee @username` would create a new issue with the title "Bug in feature X", description "Description of bug here", and assign it to the user with GitHub username "@username".'
