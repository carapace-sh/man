    command: '[AI] The `tmux swap-pane` command in TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) swaps the positions of two adjacent panes within the same window. When you run this command, it will exchange the content of the left and right, or top and bottom adjacent panes. This can be useful when working with multiple processes in separate panes and needing to swap their positions for better organization or focus.'
    flag:
        D: '[AI] `tmux swap-pane -D` is a command in TMUX terminal multiplexer for swapping the positions of two adjacent panes in a horizontal or vertical layout. The `-D` flag stands for "swapping direction," meaning that the panes will be swapped from the left to right in a horizontal layout, or from top to bottom in a vertical layout. This command is useful when you want to move focus between panes quickly while working on multiple tasks in the terminal.'
        U: '[AI] `tmux swap-pane -U` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer for swapping the positions of two adjacent panes upwards (specified by `-U`). This allows users to easily move panes around within their terminal window layout. The command can be used to adapt to changing workflow needs or to better organize multiple processes being run in parallel.'
        Z: '[AI] The `tmux swap-pane -Z` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to swap the positions of two adjacent panes (split windows) at the same vertical level, with the newer or foreground pane becoming the bottom one and vice versa. The `-Z` flag ensures that both swapped panes are displayed with their top-left corners aligned.'
        d: '[AI] `tmux swap-pane -d` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to swap the positions of two panes in a Tmux window. The `-d` option indicates that the swapped panes should be detached from their sessions, meaning they will be disconnected from their respective processes and will no longer occupy any Tmux server resources. After running this command, the content of the first pane will appear in the second one, while the original contents of the second pane will now be displayed in the first one.'
        s: |-
            [AI] `tmux swap-pane` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to swap the positions of two adjacent panes within a single window. The `-s` option specifies which pane to consider as the "source" pane for the swap operation.

            For example, if you have two panes side by side (horizontal layout) and you want to swap their positions, you can use the command `tmux swap-pane -s 0 1` where `0` is the index of the pane that you want to keep with its current position, and `1` is the index of the pane that will take the place of the first one.

            In summary, `tmux swap-pane -s` is used to swap the positions of two adjacent panes within a single TMUX window by specifying which pane is the source for the swap operation.
        t: '[AI] The `tmux swap-pane` is a command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, used to swap the positions of two adjacent panes within the same window. The `-t` option specifies the target pane identifier. So, `tmux swap-pane -t <target_pane>` will swap the current and target panes. For instance, `tmux swap-pane -t 0` would swap the pane at position 0 with the one at position 1. This command is particularly useful when working on multiple tasks within a single terminal session.'
