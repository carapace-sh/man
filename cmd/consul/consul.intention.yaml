description: Interact with Connect service intentions
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul intention` command is a part of Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. It allows users to declare desired state for resources in the Consul CLI interface, such as services, keys, or configurations. The command checks whether the current state matches the intended state and reports any differences. If the intended state is not met, it can also be used to apply the changes to reach the desired state. In essence, `consul intention` helps ensure that infrastructure and application configurations are consistent with the defined desired states.'
