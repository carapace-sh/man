description: Add a new dependency to a Dagger module
group: module
flags:
    --focus: Only show output for focused commands
    -m, --mod=: Path to dagger.json config file for the module or a directory containing that file. Either local path (e.g. "/path/to/some/dir") or a github repo (e.g. "github.com/dagger/dagger/path/to/some/subdir")
    -n, --name=: Name to use for the dependency in the module. Defaults to the name of the module being installed.

    command: |-
        [AI] The `dagger install` command is used in Dagger, a Haskell build tool, to build and install your project. It performs several tasks:

        1. Compiles all Haskell source files using the GHC compiler.
        2. Runs any tests defined in your project.
        3. Builds any executables or libraries based on your project's dependency tree.
        4. Installs the resulting binary artifacts into the system PATH, so they can be easily run from anywhere.
        5. Optionally, it generates documentation and installs it as well.

        In summary, `dagger install` is a single command that performs building, testing, and installing of your Haskell project using Dagger.
    flag:
        focus: |-
            [AI] The `dagger install --focus` command is used in Dagger, an open-source dependency injection framework for Java and Kotlin, to build and install a specific component or service that has a dependency cycle or is marked as having a special focus during the installation process.

            When a component or service depends on another that also depends on it, a circular dependency arises, which can't be resolved directly. In such cases, Dagger provides an option to mark one of these components or services as the "focus" during the installation process, allowing Dagger to resolve the dependencies in a way that makes the focus component or service installable.

            The `--focus` flag is used to specify the name or instance of the component or service to be focused during the installation process. By using this command, Dagger will prioritize building and installing the focused dependency, thereby resolving any circular dependencies that might exist in the graph.
        mod: '[AI] The command `flag "dagger install --mod"` is used with Dagger, a dependency injection and build tool for Go. It instructs Dagger to install new dependencies as specified in the `.dagerfile` or `build.gradle` file using the `--mod` (short for module) flag. This means that Dagger will download and manage the dependencies as Go modules instead of traditional vendor directories, allowing for a more modern and organized dependency management system within the project.'
        name: '[AI] The command `flag "dagger install" --name` is used in Dagger, a Haskell build tool, to install a specific project or library defined by its name. The `--name` flag specifies the project or library''s name that needs to be installed. When executed, Dagger downloads and compiles the project''s source code and makes it available for use in other projects as a dependency.'
