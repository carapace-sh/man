documentation:
    command: '[AI] The term "tea times" refers to the traditional British social custom of having a light meal or snack, usually between 4 pm and 5 pm, accompanied by tea. It is also sometimes used figuratively to mean any leisurely break during the day for relaxing and enjoying tea.'
    flag:
        fields: '[AI] The `--fields` option in the `tea times` command is used to specify which fields or columns should be displayed when listing or exporting data from a CSV file. It takes one or more field names as arguments, separated by commas. For example, `--fields column1,column2` would only display data from those two columns when using the tea times CLI.'
        from: '[AI] The `--from` flag in the `tea-times` command is used to specify a particular branch or commit in a version control system like Git, from which you want to start your tea-time analysis or comparison. This allows you to compare or analyze differences between different branches or commits.'
        login: '[AI] The "teatimes --login" flag is used in the Teatime tool, which is a popular automated testing framework for Kubernetes. This specific flag is related to authentication and login functionality. When this flag is passed during Teatime test execution, it instructs the tool to perform login operations using provided credentials before running the tests. It helps ensure that tests are executed with the correct context and access level in a Kubernetes cluster.'
        mine: '[AI] The flag "--tea-times mine" is a command-line option used in data processing or scripting contexts, often with tools like Make, Git, or other similar systems. It signifies that the specified actions or rules should be applied only to the files belonging to an individual user (usually the one running the command), and not to a shared or global set of files. In simpler terms, it ensures that only personal changes are affected, maintaining the integrity of common files across a team or system.'
        output: '[AI] The `--output` flag in the `tea times` command is used to specify an output file for the result of the tea times operation, which calculates the optimal meeting times from a list of suggested times provided by attendees. By default, the output is printed on the terminal. With `--output` followed by a filename, the result will be saved as a file instead.'
        remote: '[AI] The `--remote` flag in the `tea-times` command is used to specify that the task or workflow should be executed on a remote machine, rather than locally. The `tea-times` command is typically used with a YAML file that defines a series of tasks and their dependencies, which can be run sequentially or in parallel. By adding `--remote`, you''re instructing the tool to connect to a remote server and execute the tasks there. This can be useful for running workflows on distributed systems or in cloud environments where resources are not available locally.'
        repo: '[AI] The `--repo` flag for the `tea-times` command is used to specify the name of a Git repository when running tea-times tasks or workflows. Tea-times is a CLI tool that helps automate and manage development tasks, such as building, testing, or deploying applications. By providing the `--repo` flag with the URL or local path to a Git repository, tea-times can fetch the necessary code, dependencies, and configuration files to execute the desired task within that project context.'
        total: '[AI] The `tea times --total` flag is typically used in bash scripts or Unix-based systems to print the total number of lines in all files within a specified directory and its subdirectories. The `tea times` part likely refers to the `find` command called with the options `-type f -print0 | xargs -0 tee`, which lists all files in a recursive manner and passes them to the `tee` command for parallel processing. The `--total` flag is specific to the `find` utility when used with the `awk` or `wc` command, telling it to include the total number of lines at the end of the output. So, `tea times --total` will display the number of lines in all files within a directory and its subdirectories.'
        until: '[AI] The `--until` option in the `tea-times` command is used to specify a particular time in the past as the limit for displaying the scheduled tea breaks in the Tea-Time CLI (Command Line Interface) calendar. This allows users to view only the tea breaks that occurred before the specified time, helping them to keep track of their past tea breaks and maintain productivity.'
