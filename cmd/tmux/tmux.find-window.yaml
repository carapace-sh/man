documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tmux find-window` is a TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) command used to search for an existing window based on its title or session name. The basic syntax is `tmux find-window -t ["title|session"]`, where "title" is the window''s title and "session" is the name of the session containing the window. This command returns the window ID if found, and can be used in conjunction with other commands such as `kill-window` or `attach` to manipulate the matching window.'
    flag:
        C: '[AI] The `tmux find-window` command with the `-C` flag is used to create an new window or switch to an existing one in Tmux based on its creation or title match. The `-C` option stands for "create" or "current", meaning that if no matching window is found, Tmux will create a new one instead of raising an error. This can be useful for automating or scripting window management tasks within Tmux.'
        "N": '[AI] `tmux find-window` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that allows you to search for a specific window based on its title or number (using the `-N` option). The `-N` flag tells Tmux to look for an exact match of the given window number. For example, `tmux find-window -N 0` will return the window with the number 0. If no such window exists, the command returns an error.'
        T: '[AI] The `tmux find-window` command with the `-T` flag is used to locate a window in the TMUX terminal multiplexer based on its title. The `-T` option specifies the title pattern to search for. When executed, tmux will return the window identifier (wid) of the first matching window. If no windows match the given title pattern, an error message is displayed instead.'
        Z: '[AI] `tmux find-window` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer used to locate and target specific windows based on various criteria. The `-Z` option stands for "zeroize", which means minimizing or detaching the window from the terminal screen when selected. Thus, the command `tmux find-window -Z <criteria>` finds a window matching the given criteria and minimizes or detaches it.'
        i: '[AI] `tmux find-window` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer used to locate and select specific windows based on given criteria. The `-i` option makes the search case insensitive. So, `tmux find-window -i "terminal name"` will search for and select the window with a terminal name matching the given string, ignoring case differences.'
        r: '[AI] `tmux find-window -r` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to quickly locate and reattach a detached window based on its title or content. The `-r` flag stands for "reverse-search," which means that the search will start from the last window instead of the first one, making it useful when cycling through multiple windows in reverse order.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux find-window` is a command in the tmux terminal multiplexer. The `-t` option specifies the target window or pane identifier. With these two arguments together, `tmux find-window -t <identifier>` searches for and returns the window or pane with the given identifier within the current session. If the window or pane is found, tmux selects it. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed.'
