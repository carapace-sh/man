    command: '[AI] The "waypoint context" is a term used in robotics and navigation systems, particularly in the context of mission planning for autonomous vehicles or drones. It refers to a specific location or point in a route or path that provides additional information to the system for navigation or task execution. Waypoints are often defined by their geographic coordinates, but can also include other data such as altitude, time constraints, or objectives. The context of a waypoint refers to the information associated with it that is relevant to the mission or task at hand.'
