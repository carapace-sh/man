description: Set the current builder instance
flags:
    --default: Set builder as default for current context
    --global: Builder persists context changes
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker buildx use` is a command used in Docker to manage and select the buildx drivers, which are extensions to the standard Docker builder that enable building content in multiple contexts (like different runtimes or architectures) simultaneously. This command sets or updates the active buildx driver for your Docker installation. It doesn''t create anything new, but rather configures the environment for using specific buildx drivers when you perform builds with `docker build` or other related commands.'
    flag:
        default: '[AI] `docker buildx use --default` is a command used in Docker to configure the default builder context for `docker buildx`, which is an extension of Docker Build that enables building containers from multiple contexts (repositories) in parallel. The `--default` flag sets the current context as the default one, meaning it will be used by default when running `docker build` or similar commands without specifying a context. This can simplify the build process and ensure consistency across builds if all your Dockerfiles are located in the same context.'
        global: '[AI] `docker buildx use --global` is a command used to configure Docker Buildx, an extension of Docker that enables building containers from multiple sources including files, Git repositories, and remote builds. The `--global` flag sets the configuration as global, meaning it will be available system-wide and not limited to a specific context or project. With this command, Docker Buildx is set up to use the default driver for building images across multiple nodes or registries.'
