documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `newrelic nerdstorage document get` command is used in New Relic''s Command Line Interface (CLI) to retrieve specific documents from NerdGraph, New Relic''s query language data store.

        collection: |-
            [AI] The command `newrelic nerdstorage document get --collection` is used in New Relic's Nerdgraph Query Language (NQL) to retrieve specific documents from a collection in New Relic's NerdStorage data lake. Here's a brief explanation of its components:

            - `nerdstorage`: This refers to New Relic's data lake, where large amounts of telemetry data are stored for analysis and querying.
            - `document`: This indicates that we want to retrieve a specific document or set of documents.
            - `get`: This is the action we're performing on the document(s) - retrieving their contents.
            - `--collection`: This option specifies the name of the collection from which to retrieve the document(s). Collections in NerdStorage represent logical groupings of related data.
        documentId: '[AI] The command `newrelic nerdstorage document get --documentId <ID>` is used in New Relic''s Nerdgraph API to retrieve specific document data from NerdStorage with the given ID. NerdStorage is a data store for storing and querying custom metric, event, and text data associated with your applications monitored by New Relic. This command allows you to fetch the document details by providing its unique identifier in place of `<ID>`.'
        entityGuid: '[AI] The command `newrelic nerdstorage document get --entityGuid <GUID>` is used in New Relic''s Nerdgraph data query language to retrieve a specific document from NerdStorage, which is New Relic''s data lake, using the provided entity GUID as a filter. This command does not modify or create documents, but rather fetches the existing document with the matching entity GUID for further analysis or processing.'
        packageId: '[AI] The command `newrelic nerdstorage document get --packageId` is used in New Relic''s Nerdgraph API to retrieve a specific document based on its package ID. This API call retrieves data stored in New Relic''s NerdStorage, which is a flexible and powerful data store used for storing custom metrics, events, and other information about your applications and infrastructure monitored by New Relic. The `get` command with the `--packageId` option allows you to retrieve the document associated with that specific package ID.'
        scope: '[AI] The `newrelic nerdstorage document get --scope` command is used in New Relic''s NerdGraph API to retrieve specific documentation related to New Relic''s observability data. The `--scope` flag limits the scope of the query to a particular product or feature within New Relic, such as APM, Infrastructure, or Synthetics. This command returns the requested documentation in JSON format.'
