    command: '[AI] `terragrunt render-json` is a command used in Terragrunt, an open-source Terrform wrapper tool. It renders the output of one or more Terraform configurations as JSON format. This can be useful for passing the rendered output as input to other scripts or tools that require JSON data. The command does not apply any changes or make any infrastructure modifications; it only generates the JSON representation of the current state of your configured resources.'
