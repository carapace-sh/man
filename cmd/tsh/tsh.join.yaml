documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tsh join` command in Tenable Security Center is used to merge multiple vulnerability scan results into a single report. It allows users to combine data from scans of the same asset or different assets that share common attributes, such as IP addresses or hostnames. This can be helpful for gaining a comprehensive view of an organization''s security posture by consolidating findings from various scans performed over time or across multiple systems.'
    flag:
        cluster: '[AI] `tsh join --cluster` is a command used in the Traefik Load Balancer and Router software. This command is used to add new Traefik instances into an existing Traefik cluster. The `--cluster` flag indicates that the operation concerns joining a cluster rather than creating a standalone instance. When you run this command, it establishes communication between the new and existing Traefik instances, enabling them to share configurations and exchange load balancing data for improved overall performance and high availability.'
        invite: '[AI] `tsh join --invite` is a command in TortoiseSVN, a popular Subversion (SVN) client for Windows. This command is used to invite new users or external repositories to join an existing SVN project or repository. The `--invite` option sends an email invitation to the specified users with instructions on how to access the repository. Once they accept the invitation, they will be able to commit and make changes to the repository.'
        mode: '[AI] `tsh join --mode` is a command in TortoiseSVN, a popular Subversion (SVN) client for Windows. This command is used to join two or more working copies into a single one while preserving their differences as new Working Copies or Merge Information. The `--mode` option specifies the merge method that will be used during the join operation. There are several modes available, including "ours", "theirs", and "mine". The default is "mine", which means that TortoiseSVN will use your version of each file to resolve conflicts. Other modes allow you to specify which version from the joining Working Copies should be used to resolve conflicts or merge the changes manually.'
        reason: '[AI] The `--reason` option is used with the `git tsh join` command in the Git Toolkit for Subversion (tsh) tool. It specifies the reason or message explaining why two revisions are being joined together into a single revision in the Git history. This can be useful when merging branches or resolving merge conflicts, allowing you to clearly document the changes made during the process.'
