documentation:
    command: '[AI] `nix-repl` is a interactive command-line tool provided by Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It allows users to interactively evaluate expressions, query available packages and their builds, and perform various other tasks related to managing and using Nix packages. By starting the REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) with `nix-repl`, users can access Nix''s functionality directly from the terminal without having to write a configuration file or build a specific package.'
    flag:
        arg: '[AI] `nix repl --arg` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `nix repl` part of the command invokes the Nix interactive shell or REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop). The `--arg` flag is an option that allows you to pass an argument to the command that gets evaluated in the REPL session. For example, `nix repl --arg "myArg=5"` starts a new REPL session with the variable `myArg` set to the value `5`. This can be useful for testing or experimenting with Nix expressions without having to write a separate file.'
        argstr: '[AI] `nix repl --argstr` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `nix repl` part of the command invokes the Nix expression language REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop), which allows interactively writing and evaluating Nix expressions. The `--argstr` flag is an option passed to this REPL, allowing users to provide a list of arguments that will be available in the current session. These arguments can then be accessed and used within the expressions evaluated in the REPL.'
        commit-lock-file: |-
            [AI] The `--commit-lock-file` flag is used with the Nix package manager's interactive REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) to enforce transactional behavior when making commitments or modifications to the system configuration.

            When this flag is provided, any changes made within the REPL are first written to a temporary lock file before being committed to the actual Nix store. This ensures that no conflicting changes occur if multiple sessions are modifying the system concurrently. If another session attempts to make changes while a lock file exists, it will be blocked until the first session commits or discards its changes.

            This flag is particularly useful for large-scale deployments and collaborative environments where multiple administrators need to work on the same Nix configuration without worrying about conflicting modifications.
        debug: |-
            [AI] `nix repl --debug` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `repl` part stands for "REPL", which means "Read-Evaluate-Print Loop" in programming terminology.

            This command starts the Nix REPL environment with debugging mode enabled. In this mode, the REPL provides more detailed output and error messages to help diagnose issues when using Nix commands or expressions. The debug information can be useful for understanding complex Nix configurations or for troubleshooting build failures.
        debugger: '[AI] `nix-repl --debugger` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `nix-repl` is an interactive shell that lets users evaluate expressions and queries against the Nix expression language. The `--debugger` flag enables the Nix REPL to start in debugger mode, providing enhanced features such as stepping through expressions, inspecting variables, and setting breakpoints for deeper analysis and troubleshooting of complex Nix expressions.'
        eval-store: '[AI] The `--eval-store` flag is used with Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It enables persisting the results of evaluating expressions in the Nix expression language between sessions. When this flag is set, the output of an evaluation is saved in a store, allowing subsequent evaluations to use the previously computed results instead of recomputing them from scratch. This can significantly improve build and evaluation times for complex systems that involve repeated evaluations of the same expressions.'
        expr: '[AI] `nix-repl` is an interactive shell provided by Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. The `--expr` option is passed to `nix-repl` to enable expression mode. In this mode, the REPL evaluates expressions written in Nix expression language, which is used to define and manipulate Nix packages and their builds. So, starting the `nix-repl` with `--expr` flag enables an environment where you can write and evaluate Nix expressions on the fly.'
        file: '[AI] The `nix-repl --file` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It opens the Nix interactive shell (REPL) and loads a specified file containing Nix expressions or configurations. This allows users to evaluate or modify the expressions interactively, apply them to build or configure software packages, or experiment with new configurations without modifying the original file directly.'
        impure: '[AI] The `--impure` flag is used with the Nix expression language''s REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop). It allows for side effects in expressions, meaning that functions or values defined within the REPL persist between evaluations, unlike when using the pure evaluation mode. This can be useful for interactive experimentation and building up complex Nix expressions step by step.'
        include: '[AI] `nix-repl --include` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command starts an interactive Nix expression evaluation session (Nix REPL), allowing users to load and evaluate expressions or functions from external files by passing the file paths as arguments using `--include`. For example: `nix-repl --include path/to/file1 path/to/file2`. Each included file is loaded in the order specified, enabling users to write complex expressions or functions across multiple files.'
        inputs-from: '[AI] `nix repl` is a Nix expression evaluator that provides an interactive REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) shell for Nix expressions. The option `--inputs-from <file>` allows you to specify a file containing the input expressions or packages that should be loaded before starting the REPL session. This can be useful when working with complex expressions or large projects, as it avoids having to manually import every required package in the REPL each time.'
        log-format: '[AI] `nix repl --log-format` is a command-line option used with Nix, an open-source configuration management system and package manager. This option sets the logging format for the Nix interactive REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop). By specifying a valid log format string, users can customize the output of Nix repl''s logs to better suit their needs or debugging purposes. Some common formats include plain text, JSON, and verbose. For instance, `--log-format="json"` would output logs in JSON format for easier parsing or processing by other tools.'
        no-registries: |-
            [AI] `nix-repl --no-registries` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `nix-repl` (Nix Interactive REPL) is an interactive shell where you can evaluate expressions related to Nix packages and their builds.

            The `--no-registries` flag disables the use of remote package registries during the evaluation. This means that only locally installed and available packages will be used, and no packages will be downloaded or fetched from external sources. It's useful when working offline or with a restricted network connection, as it ensures that the shell operates on a local Nix environment without any external dependencies.
        no-update-lock-file: |-
            [AI] `nix repl --no-update-lock-file` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `nix repl` part invokes the Nix expression language REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop).

            The `--no-update-lock-file` flag disables the creation of a lock file when using this command. Lock files are used to ensure that multiple instances of a build do not interfere with each other, preventing unexpected issues during builds. By passing this flag, you're opting out of the lock file mechanism for your current Nix expression language REPL session.
        no-write-lock-file: '[AI] The `--no-write-lock-file` flag is an option for Nix, a package manager used primarily in the Linux environment. This flag disables Nix from creating a write-lock file when performing certain operations like building or installing packages. By not creating a lock file, multiple Nix processes can perform these tasks concurrently without interfering with each other. This can be useful for increasing build and installation throughput in environments where multiple Nix processes may be running simultaneously.'
        override-flake: |-
            [AI] `nix repl --override-flake` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This command starts an interactive Nix expression evaluator (REPL) session with the added flag `--override-flake`.

            The flag `--override-flake` allows overriding specific attributes of a project defined in a Nix flake configuration file, enabling you to test or experiment with different configurations without modifying the original source code. It can be used to evaluate expressions related to that project during the REPL session, providing flexibility and additional functionality for Nix users.
        override-input: '[AI] `nix repl --override-input` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `--override-input` option allows users to provide custom inputs to a Nix expression when invoking the Nix REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop). This can be useful for testing custom configurations or making modifications on the fly without having to edit the underlying configuration files directly. When using this command, the user specifies the input file and its contents as arguments, which are then made available in the Nix REPL environment for evaluation.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] `nix repl --print-build-logs` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This command starts the Nix interactive REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) and asks it to print the build logs of the last command that built something with Nix. The logs contain detailed information about the build process, including any errors or warnings that occurred during the build.'
        quiet: '[AI] `nix repl --quiet` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `--quiet` option reduces the amount of output during the execution of the Nix interactive shell (repl), making it run with minimal messages or errors. In summary, `nix repl --quiet` starts the Nix REPL in quiet mode, which means it runs commands without verbose output.'
        recreate-lock-file: '[AI] The `--recreate-lock-file` flag is used with Nix''s replacement command (`nix-replace-expr` or simply `nix repl`). This flag instructs the command to recreate the lock file if it already exists before applying the replacement expression. A lock file is a mechanism used for concurrency control, preventing multiple processes from modifying the same file at once. By recreating the lock file, Nix ensures that only one instance of the command can run at a time and eliminates potential conflicts or errors caused by parallel executions.'
        update-input: '[AI] `nix-repl --update-input` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `--update-input` option is used to update the input to the Nix REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop). It allows users to refresh or update the available inputs in the current Nix environment before running commands, ensuring they have access to the latest packages and configurations.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] `nix-repl --verbose` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `nix-repl` (short for "replacement shell") is an interactive environment where you can evaluate expressions related to Nix packages and configurations.

            The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output produced by the command. It provides more detailed information about the commands executed in the Nix repl, including the loading of modules and evaluation of expressions, which can be useful for debugging or understanding complex Nix configurations.
