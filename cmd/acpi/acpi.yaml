documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `acpi` command is a utility in Linux systems for interacting with the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) subsystem. ACPI is a power management technology that allows operating systems to control various hardware components, including CPUs, displays, and batteries, to conserve energy and improve power efficiency. The `acpi` command provides information about the current power status of these devices, as well as the capability to perform actions such as putting the system into sleep or hibernation mode.'
    flag:
        ac-adapter: '[AI] The `acpi --ac-adapter` command is a utility provided by the ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) package in Linux. This command is used to query the power supply status of an AC (Alternating Current) adapter or battery connected to a system.When run, it returns information about the attached power sources such as their current status (online or offline), type (mains or battery), presence or absence of overcurrent condition, and the voltage level if applicable. The output is typically in a human-readable format and can be used for various system administration tasks like monitoring power status or triggering actions based on power source availability.'
        battery: '[AI] `acpi --battery` is a command used in Linux systems to query the battery status information of portable computers or laptops using the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) technology. This command provides detailed information about the battery, such as its current charge level, design capacity, temperature, and estimated time to empty or full. It helps users monitor their system''s battery health and predict power consumption patterns for efficient usage.'
        cooling: '[AI] The `acpi --cooling` command is a utility in Linux systems used to manage and control fan speed based on ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) cooling data. This command interacts with the operating system''s ACPI subsystem, which gathers temperature sensor readings from various hardware components and provides relevant data for adjusting fan speeds accordingly. Using `acpi --cooling` can help maintain an optimal balance between power usage and thermal comfort for a computer system.'
        details: '[AI] `acpi --details` is a command used in Linux systems to inspect the ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) table data. This command provides a verbose output that includes information about various system components, such as processors, batteries, and thermal zones, along with their status and capabilities. The detailed output helps system administrators diagnose power management issues, identify hardware configurations, and understand the power relationships between different devices in the system.'
        directory: '[AI] The `acpi --directory` command is a utility from the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification for Linux systems. It is used to list all ACPI tables present in the system''s ROM or RAM, displaying their file names and locations as absolute paths under a specified directory. By default, it lists files in the root directory (/). To specify a different directory, provide its path as an argument: `acpi --directory /path/to/directory`. This command is particularly useful for developers and system administrators to examine and work with ACPI tables directly.'
        everything: '[AI] `acpi --everything` is a command used in Linux systems to inspect and dump detailed information about the ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) tables and structures. The `--everything` option requests the most comprehensive output, including all table types, data fields, and their corresponding values. It provides an extensive view of the system''s power management configuration.'
        fahrenheit: '[AI] The `acpi --fahrenheit` command is a utility from the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) system. It''s used to display the temperature readings from sensors in Fahrenheit format, as opposed to the default Celsius. This command can be helpful for system administrators or users who prefer working with temperatures in Fahrenheit. When executed, it displays the current temperature readings from various sensors in your system along with their respective Fahrenheit values.'
        help: '[AI] `acpi --help` is a command used in Linux systems to display help information about the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) utility. ACPI is a power management system that enables communication between the operating system and hardware components, allowing for efficient power usage and better performance. The `--help` option provides detailed explanations of various ACPI commands, their arguments, and their functions, making it an essential tool for administrators and developers working with power management in Linux systems.'
        kelvin: '[AI] The `acpi -- temperature --current --kelvin` command is used in Linux to retrieve the current temperature reading from the ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) subsystem, expressed in Kelvin units. It provides real-time thermal sensor data for system components such as CPUs, GPUs, and other hardware, allowing users to monitor temperatures and ensure proper thermal management within their systems.'
        proc: '[AI] The `acpi --proc` command is a utility from the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification used to query system-specific ACPI data related to individual processors or processor cores in a multi-core system. It prints detailed information about the power management capabilities and states of each processor, such as thermal and power status, supported power states, and current power state. The output is usually in a tabular format that can be parsed for further automation or analysis purposes.'
        show-empty: '[AI] The `acpi --show-empty` command is a utility from the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification used to inspect system tables, which control power management in modern operating systems. This specific command is used to display empty or uninitialized entries within these tables, providing more comprehensive information about the hardware and its power states.'
        thermal: |-
            [AI] The "acpi -- thermal" command is a utility from the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification, which allows users to query and control the thermal subsystem of their system. This subsystem monitors temperature sensors and manages cooling fans or other thermal devices to maintain safe operating temperatures for hardware components.

            The "-- thermal" option specifically requests output related to ACPI's thermal management functionality, displaying information such as current sensor readings, thermal zones, thresholds, and fan speeds. This can be useful in diagnosing thermal issues, monitoring system temperatures, or configuring custom thermal profiles.
        version: '[AI] `acpi --version` is a command used in Linux and Unix-based systems to display version information about the ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) subsystem. ACPI is a power management technology that enables communication between an operating system and hardware components for efficient power usage and improved performance. The `acpi --version` command simply prints out the version number of the ACPI implementation installed in your system.'
