documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pnpm store` command is used in PNPM (Parallel NPM), a package manager that builds on top of Node.js and npm, to interact with the global cache or store. This command allows you to manage packages installed globally using PNPM, such as installing, uninstalling, updating, or listing them. It also enables users to share their global installation directory across multiple projects and makes it possible to use different package versions for each project within the same workspace without conflicts.'
