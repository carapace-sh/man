    command: '[AI] The `waypoint server config-set` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source continuous delivery and deployment tool, to modify the configuration of a running Waypoint server. This command takes one or more key-value pairs as arguments, where each key corresponds to a specific configuration option for the Waypoint server. By using this command, you can change various aspects of your Waypoint setup, such as the API token, the listening address, or the log level, without having to restart the server. The updated configuration takes effect immediately after the command is executed.'
    flag:
        advertise-addr: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint server config-set --advertise-addr"` is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool. This command sets the advertised IP address for Waypoint''s built-in NATS server, which allows other services to discover and communicate with it. By providing an IP address as an argument, you enable Waypoint to advertise that address as its listening endpoint in a NATS Servers cluster, enhancing service discovery and communication within your network.'
        advertise-tls: '[AI] The `waypoint server config-set --advertise-tls` command is used to configure Waypoint, an open-source multi-cluster Kubernetes management tool, to advertise TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption for its API server. In simpler terms, it enables secure communication between clients and the Waypoint server over encrypted channels. This setting is essential for enhancing security in production environments where data confidentiality and integrity are of high importance.'
        advertise-tls-skip-verify: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint server config-set --advertise-tls-verify false` command is used in Hashicorp's Waypoint configuration management tool. It disables TLS certificate verification when Waypoint advertises itself as an API server to other components in the system.

            By default, Waypoint verifies the TLS certificates presented by clients connecting to it for security reasons. However, in certain scenarios, such as when working with self-signed certificates or trusting specific hosts, disabling certificate verification might be necessary. The command above sets the `advertise_tls_verify` configuration parameter to `false`, which accomplishes this task.

            Keep in mind that disabling TLS certificate verification introduces potential security risks, as it could allow man-in-the-middle attacks or other malicious activities. Therefore, this command should only be used when necessary and with caution.
        app: |-
            [AI] The `flag "waypoint server config-set --app"` is a command used in Waypoint, an open-source application delivery platform by Hashicorp. This command is utilized to configure or update the settings of a specific application deployed with Waypoint.

            `config-set` is the subcommand being used here which sets or updates the configuration for an app. The `--app` flag is used to specify the name or identifier of the target application to be configured. When this command is issued, Waypoint retrieves and modifies the configuration file for the specified application with the new settings.
        plain: '[AI] The `waypoint server config-set --plain` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool. It sets a specific configuration value in Waypoint, displaying the raw, plain text value without any additional formatting or encryption. This can be useful for manually editing configuration values or scripting changes to multiple configurations at once. The `--plain` flag instructs Waypoint to return the configuration value as plain text instead of encrypted or formatted.'
        project: '[AI] The command `waypoint server config-set --project` is used in Waypoint, an open-source multi-cloud application delivery platform developed by Hashicorp. This command sets a configuration value for a specific project within Waypoint''s managed environment. In simple terms, it updates the project''s configuration file with the new setting.'
        workspace: |-
            [AI] The command `flag "waypoint server" config-set --workspace` is used with Waypoint, an open-source tool for managing infrastructure as code (IaC) using Hashicorp's HCL configuration files. This specific command is for setting the current workspace in Waypoint server.

            When you run this command followed by the name of your desired workspace, Waypoint server will switch its context to manage and deploy the IaC resources associated with that workspace. It's a way to tell Waypoint which set of configurations to work on. This can be particularly useful when managing multiple environments or projects within a single Waypoint installation.
