description: Upgrade your cluster smoothly to a newer version with this command
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubeadm upgrade` is a command used in Kubernetes to perform an in-place upgrade of a Kubeadm control-plane cluster. It downloads, configures, and applies the latest version of Kubernetes components (such as kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler) on existing master nodes while keeping etcd data persistent. This command should be run with caution as it involves upgrading critical cluster components and may require additional configuration for stateless workloads to continue running during the upgrade process. Upgrades can also be performed using Kubernetes'' rolling update strategy, which minimizes downtime by updating nodes one at a time.'
