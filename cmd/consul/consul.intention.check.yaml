documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul intent check` command is used in Consul, a Connect and Orchestration tool by Hashicorp, to verify if there are any planned changes to the configuration of registered services or infrastructure. It compares the current state with the intended state stored in Consul''s KV (Key-Value) store and returns any differences as proposed modifications. This can help ensure that intended changes are carried out correctly before they are applied, reducing the risk of unintended consequences.'
    flag:
        ca-file: |-
            [AI] The `consul intention check` is a command in the Consul service discovery and configuration tool, which allows checking whether a desired configuration matches the current state of registered services and configurations in the Consul cluster.

            The option `--ca-file` is used to specify the path to a CA (Certificate Authority) file for verifying the TLS certificates presented by the Consul servers during communication. This helps ensure secure communication between the client running the command and the Consul cluster.
        ca-path: '[AI] The `consul intent check --ca-path` command is used in Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool from Hashicorp, to verify the certificate authority (CA) path for an intended configuration change. This command helps ensure that only trusted Certificate Authorities have signed the certificates of new or updated services before they are actually deployed. It returns a status indicating whether or not the provided CA path matches that of the intended configuration''s certificates, enabling you to maintain security and validate changes in your Consul-managed infrastructure.'
        client-cert: '[AI] The `consul intent check --client-cert` command is used with Consul, a Connect and service discovery tool. This command performs an intent check using a client certificate to verify if a particular service instance is registered or intended to be registered in the Consul service registry. By providing the client certificate, the command ensures that only instances with that certificate are considered during the intent check process. This can help maintain security by ensuring that only authorized instances of a service are running and being discovered by the Consul service registry.'
        client-key: |-
            [AI] The `consul intent check --client-key` command is used in Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool, to verify if an intended change to the configuration of a service or resource is safe to apply based on the current state in the Consul cluster.

            The `--client-key` option specifies the client key for an authorized Consul agent or application that has been granted permissions to modify the configuration. When this command is run, Consul compares the intended change with the current state of the cluster and returns information about any differences. If there are no differences, then the change can be safely applied. If there are differences, further action is required to reconcile the discrepancies before making the change. This helps prevent unintended or destructive modifications to the configuration in a multi-agent environment.
        datacenter: |-
            [AI] The `consul intent check --datacenter` command is used with Hashicorp Consul, a service discovery and configuration management tool. This command is part of Consul's CLI (Command Line Interface) and is used to verify intended changes to the Consul cluster before applying them.

            By specifying `--datacenter`, the command checks the intended state only for the specified datacenter. A dataccenter represents a logical partition within a Consul cluster, allowing you to manage services, nodes, and configurations separately for different environments or regions.

            The output of this command displays the differences between the current state and the desired state in JSON format, helping you to review and confirm the changes before applying them using `consul reload` or `consul apply`. This way, you can ensure that your intended modifications won't introduce unintended consequences or conflicts within your Consul cluster.
        http-addr: '[AI] The `consul intent check --http-addr` command is used in Consul, a service discovery and configuration management tool, to verify if a specific intent (desired state) for an HTTP service exists. This command takes an HTTP address as its argument and checks the Consul server for that intent. If the intent matches the current state of the registered service, the command returns success; otherwise, it indicates a mismatch or failure.'
        namespace: '[AI] The `consul intent check` command is a part of Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. This command is used to verify that Consul has recorded the intended state for a specific resource, such as a Kubernetes service or config map. The `--namespace` flag is optional and is used to specify the namespace in which the resource resides when using Consul with Kubernetes. This flag helps ensure that Consul is managing the correct resource in the correct namespace.'
        stale: '[AI] `consul intent check --stale` is a command in Hashicorp Consul, an service discovery, configuration, and orchestration tool. This command checks for stale intents in the Consul data center. An intent represents a desired state of a resource managed by Consul. The `--stale` flag instructs Consul to return stale intents, which are intentions that have been proposed but not yet acknowledged or rejected. By checking for stale intents, system administrators can identify and address potential inconsistencies or conflicts in the intended state of their infrastructure managed by Consul.'
        tls-server-name: |-
            [AI] The `consul intent check --tls-server-name` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, a service discovery and configuration management tool. It performs an intent check with TLS server name verification enabled.

            Intent checks help validate that the intended state of resources in Consul matches the actual state. In this specific command, the flag `--tls-server-name` ensures that during the communication between the client and the Consul server, the server's SSL certificate is verified against a specified DNS name or IP address. This adds an extra layer of security to the intent check process by verifying the identity of the server before proceeding with the check.
        token: '[AI] The `consul intent check --token` command is a feature of the Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. It allows users to check if an intended change to the configuration of a service or application registered with Consul would result in any difference when applied, without actually making the change. This helps prevent accidental misconfigurations or unwanted downtime. The `--token` option is used to authenticate and authorize the request with Consul''s HTTP API.'
        token-file: |-
            [AI] The `consul intent check` command is a feature in Hashicorp's Consul service that allows checking whether a proposed change to a configuration would result in any modifications being applied, without actually making the changes.

            The option `--token-file` specifies the path to a file containing an API token. This token is used for authentication and authorization purposes when interacting with the Consul HTTP API. By using this option, users can ensure they have the necessary permissions to make the intended configuration changes before actually executing them.

            In summary, `consul intent check --token-file` allows you to preview and validate proposed configuration modifications in a risk-free manner, without affecting the actual system until you decide to apply the intended changes.
