documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dagger publish` is a command used in Dagger, an open-source build and dependency management tool for Java and Android projects. This command builds your project, analyzes its dependencies, and then generates and publishes signed artifacts to a Maven or Ivy repository. It''s commonly used for distributing libraries and other components to be included as dependencies in other projects.'
    flag:
        focus: '[AI] `dagger publish --focus` is a command used in Dagger, an open-source build and dependency management tool for Java. This command publishes artifacts from a specific focus (a set of built Docker images or Jar files) to a repository, such as Google''s Maven or Docker Hub. It is often used to share developed components with collaborators or make them available to other projects in the same ecosystem. By using the `--focus` option, only the selected focus will be published, ensuring that unwanted artifacts are not distributed.'
        force: '[AI] `dagger publish --force` is a command used in Dagger, a build tool for Dart programming language. This command publishes an artifact to a repository, such as Maven or Pub, overriding any existing version with the same name and making it available for other projects to depend on. The `--force` flag is optional but when provided, it allows the operation to proceed even if it would normally be prevented due to version conflicts. It''s useful when you intentionally want to update an artifact with a new version while disregarding any potential version conflicts that may occur.'
        mod: '[AI] `dagger publish --mod` is a command used in Dagger, a build tool for Java and Kotlin projects. This command publishes a local Maven or Gradle repository with one or more modules as artifacts, making them available for other projects to depend on. The `--mod` flag specifies that only the given modules should be published.'
