    command: '[AI] `git show-index` is a Git command used to display the contents and metadata of the index, which is an intermediate data structure in Git that stores changes before they are committed. By default, it shows the name, mode, hash, and size of each file in the index. You can also specify a particular file or commit using `-- <file>` or `-- <commit>`, respectively, to display only the information related to that file or commit.'
