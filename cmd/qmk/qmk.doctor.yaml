        [AI] `qmk doctor` is a command-line utility for the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware. It performs various checks on your keyboard firmware project, ensuring its correctness and readiness for compilation.

        Here's a brief overview of what it does:

        1. Verifies syntax: Checks for any errors or inconsistencies in the keymap file(s) using the QMK parser.
        2. Compiles the keymap: Compiles your keymap files into C source code, which is then included in the main firmware build.
        3. Build checks: Verifies that all necessary libraries and dependencies are present and up-to-date.
        4. Reports issues: Provides a detailed report of any detected errors, warnings, or potential issues.
        5. Suggests solutions: In some cases, it may even suggest possible solutions to help resolve identified issues.

        In summary, `qmk doctor` acts as a diagnostic tool for your QMK firmware project, ensuring its integrity and readiness for compilation.
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `qmk doctor --help` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project to check the integrity and validate the keys files in a QMK project. The `--help` flag provides detailed information about how to use this specific command, including available options such as `--fix`, which automatically attempts to correct any identified issues, and `--verbose`, which increases the level of output for debugging purposes.'
        "no": |-
            [AI] The `qmk doctor --no` command is used in the QMK keyboard firmware project to check for potential issues or errors in a custom keyboard layout. The `--no` flag is used to specify that no automatic fixes should be applied during the diagnosis process.

            The QMK Doctor tool scans the keyboard layout files and reports any detected problems, such as missing or misconfigured keycodes, layers, or macros. It also checks for common mistakes and inconsistencies. If `--no` flag is used, the Doctor will only report issues without attempting to fix them automatically.

            Using `qmk doctor --no` is useful when you want to see all potential problems in your keyboard layout but prefer to resolve them manually instead of allowing the tool to make automatic changes.
        "yes": '[AI] `qmk doctor --yes` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project to perform self-diagnostics on keyboard firmware builds. The `--yes` option provides an affirmative answer to all diagnostic prompts, allowing the tool to run automatically and thoroughly check for potential issues or errors within the compiled firmware. If any problems are detected, the doctor tool will provide suggestions for resolving them.'
