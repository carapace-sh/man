name: scale SERVICE=REPLICAS [SERVICE=REPLICAS...]
description: Scale one or multiple replicated services
flags:
    -d, --detach: Exit immediately instead of waiting for the service to converge
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker service scale` is a command used with Docker Swarm to update the number of replicas for a specific service. The syntax is as follows: `docker service scale <service_name>=[<num_replicas>]`. If no value is provided for `<num_replicas>`, it updates the number of replicas to match the current definition. This command allows you to add or remove instances of a service in a Docker Swarm cluster, adjusting its capacity dynamically.'
    flag:
        detach: '[AI] The `docker service scale --detach` command is used to update the number of replicas for a Docker Swarm service while detaching currently running containers from their tasks. This means that the existing containers will not be replaced or updated, but new replicas will be created and started as specified in the scale command. The detached mode allows the containers to continue running even after the update, which can be useful for testing new versions of a service without disrupting production traffic. When used with the `--replicas` flag to set the desired number of instances, the command scales the service horizontally.'
