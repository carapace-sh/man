documentation:
    command: '[AI] `bat` is a lightweight text-based UI mode for Windows'' `more.exe` utility, designed to provide a better terminal experience when dealing with large files or streams of data. It offers features like scrolling with the mouse wheel, searching with regular expressions, and line wrapping. Bat stands for "Better Alternative To" TASKeyKey (Terminal Application of SKeenaY), but it''s not directly related to the `bat` file extension used for batch scripts in Windows.'
    flag:
        acknowledgements: '[AI] The `--acknowledgements` flag is an option used in some command-line tools, typically within the context of message queues or event-driven systems. This flag is used to acknowledge that a particular message has been processed successfully. When a consumer program processes a message, it can use this flag to inform the queue manager that the message has been handled and can be safely removed from the queue. This helps maintain the integrity of the messaging system by ensuring that messages are not inadvertently processed multiple times.'
        cache-dir: '[AI] The `--cache-dir` flag in Bash (or any Unix-like shell) is used to specify a custom directory for caching downloaded packages or build artifacts when using tools like `apt`, `yum`, or `npm`. When this option is provided, these tools will store their cache files in the specified directory instead of the default location. This can be helpful for managing and cleaning up cache files more efficiently.'
        chop-long-lines: '[AI] The `bat` flag `--chop-long-lines` is used to automatically split long lines in output for better display in the terminal. When this option is set, Bat, a cat-like file viewer, will break long lines at column 80 by default (configurable) and add an ellipsis `...` indicator to show that the line has been truncated. This makes it easier to read large files or logs with long lines in the terminal without having to scroll horizontally.'
        color: '[AI] The `bat` is a popular terminal pager and diff tool for Linux and other Unix-like systems. The option `--color` or `-colour` (depending on your shell) is used to enable colored output when using bat to view text files. By default, bat uses a monochrome color scheme, but with the `--color` flag enabled, it enhances readability by adding syntax highlighting and other visual cues for different file types or programming languages.'
        config-dir: '[AI] The `--config-dir` option in Bat, a batch scripting language for Windows, is used to specify a custom directory where Bat''s configuration files are located. This allows users to easily manage their Bat settings by storing and modifying the files in one place instead of editing individual scripts. When Bat starts, it reads these configuration files to set various options and behaviors.'
        config-file: '[AI] The `--config-file` option in the `bat` command-line tool is used to specify a custom configuration file for Bat''s rich text output. By default, Bat uses a global configuration file located at `~/.batrc` on Unix-based systems and `%APPDATA%\batman\batrc.txt` on Windows. Using `--config-file` allows users to override the default settings with their own configurations stored in a file of their choice.'
        decorations: '[AI] The `--decorations` flag in Bat, a Windows batch scripting language, is used to enable or disable various decorative elements in the command prompt window when running commands or scripts. When this option is set to `on`, it enhances the display of output by adding colors, underlines, and other visual cues to the text, making it easier to distinguish between different types of data and errors. Conversely, setting `--decorations off` will turn off these decorative features for a more plaintext display.'
        diagnostic: '[AI] The `bat` `--diagnostic` flag is a command-line argument used with the `bat` pager for displaying text files. It instructs `bat` to output diagnostic messages about potential syntax errors or formatting issues in the file, instead of displaying the file''s content. These messages are helpful when troubleshooting code and can include information such as unrecognized keywords, missing semicolons, or incorrect indentation.'
        diff: '[AI] The `bat` `--diff` flag is used with the `bat` command-line pager tool to display the differences between two text files side by side in an unified diff format. This can be useful when comparing the changes made to files during development or version control. When you run `bat file1.txt file2.txt --diff`, it will show the differences between the contents of `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` with additions, deletions, and context indicated in the output.'
        diff-context: '[AI] The `--diff-context` option is a flag used with Git''s `diff` command for displaying the difference between two versions of a file. It specifies the number of lines of context to be shown around the differences in the output. For example, `git diff --context=5 fileA fileB` will show 5 lines of context before and after each difference. This can help provide more context when reviewing the changes made between two file versions.'
        file-name: '[AI] The `--flag file-name` option in a command or script is used to specify the name of a file to be processed. For instance, in Bat (Bash-like) scripts, this option is often used with tools like `cp`, `mv`, or `find` commands. When you run these commands with the `--flag file-name`, it tells the command to use the specified file as its input or target instead of taking it from the standard input or interactively prompting for a filename. This can be useful for automating tasks or scripts where the name and location of the files to be used are known in advance.'
        force-colorization: '[AI] The `--force-colorization` flag is a command-line option used with the `bat` text editor and pager for Windows. This option forces bat to always apply colorization to text output, making it easier to distinguish different types of content such as errors, warnings, code keywords, etc., enhancing readability.'
        generate-config-file: '[AI] `bat --generate-config-file` is a command used by Bat, a cat-like file viewer for the console, to generate a new configuration file in JSON format. This command creates an empty or default Bat config file, which can be customized later with various settings such as themes, keybindings, and behaviors. The generated file is saved with the name `batconfig.json` by default, but it can also be specified through an argument if desired.'
        help: '[AI] The `--help` flag is a common option used in command-line tools, including the Bat (Better Applicative Testing) testing framework. When run with this argument, Bat displays comprehensive help information about how to use the tool. This includes a brief description of what Bat does, instructions on how to install it, and detailed explanations of all available commands and options. Using `bat --help` is an effective way for users to quickly understand the capabilities of the framework and how to leverage them.'
        highlight-line: '[AI] The `--highlight-line` flag is a command-line option used by some text editors and code readers, such as Bat (Better Alternative to The Finder) for Windows, to highlight the current line in the terminal output. This can be helpful when reading through long lists or logs, making it easier to keep track of which line is being referenced or processed at any given moment.'
        ignored-suffix: '[AI] The `--ignored-suffix` option in the Bat (Better Alternative to Test) testing framework is used to specify file extension suffixes that should be ignored during file pattern matching for test discovery. This means that files with the specified suffixes will not be considered as test files and will not be run unless explicitly mentioned using other test discovery methods or by executing those specific tests directly. This option can be useful when dealing with projects that have a large number of non-test files with similar naming patterns to test files.'
        italic-text: '[AI] The `--italic-text` flag is a command line option used with the Bat (Better Alignment Tool) utility. It''s specifically designed to italicize text within Bat scripts or output. When this flag is passed to Bat during script execution, any specified text will be displayed in an italic font style. This can help distinguish and emphasize certain parts of a script or output for improved readability.'
        language: '[AI] The `--flag bat` is not a standard flag used in programming or command-line interfaces. It appears to be specific to Bat (Batch) scripting language. The purpose of this flag, if it exists at all, would depend on the specific Bat script tool or application that uses it. Without further context, it''s impossible to provide a definitive explanation. However, in general, flags in the context of command-line interfaces are used to modify the behavior or functionality of a command or script. So if `--flag bat` is recognized by a Bat scripting tool, it might be used to enable or configure some Bat-specific feature.'
        lessopen: '[AI] The `bat --lessopen` command is a feature of Bat, an open-source text viewer and editor for the command line. This specific command is used to open files in Bat without displaying the less pager interface by default. Instead, Bat will directly open the file in its text editor mode. To use this command, simply call `bat --lessopen <file_path>` instead of the regular `bat <file_path>`.'
        line-range: '[AI] The `bat` `--line-range` flag is a configuration option for the `bat` pager tool. It specifies that each output line should be prefixed with its corresponding file name and line number in the format `[file:line]`. This can be helpful when working with large files or multiple files to easily identify which line belongs to which file during text review.'
        list-languages: '[AI] `bat` is a cat-like pager for the console, providing various features like syntax highlighting and tab completion. The command `bat --list-languages` is used to display a list of supported file types and their corresponding language aliases. It''s useful when you want to check if bat supports the syntax highlighting for a specific file type or when configuring bat for your project.'
        list-themes: '[AI] The `bat` is a simple yet powerful text-based file viewer and pager for the terminal, written in Rust. The command `bat --list-themes` is used to display a list of available themes supported by Bat. The themes determine the color scheme and appearance of the output when using Bat to view files. This command allows users to see which themes are currently available and choose one that best fits their preferences.'
        map-syntax: '[AI] `bat` is a cat-like file viewing tool for the terminal, known for its syntax highlighting and intuitive user interface. The `--map-syntax` option is used to customize the filetype detection and corresponding syntax highlighting rules in `bat`. It takes a JSON file as an argument that defines custom mappings between file extensions or magic numbers and specific syntax themes. For instance, `--map-syntax myfile.json` would load syntax definitions from the given file named "myfile.json" to apply customized highlighting for files with specified extensions or types.'
        no-config: '[AI] The `bat` is a simple text-based file viewer. The command `bat --no-config` is used to open files with Bat without loading any custom configuration files. This means that the default settings of Bat will be applied when opening files instead of any user-defined or system-wide configurations.'
        no-custom-assets: '[AI] The `bat` flag `--no-custom-assets` is used to disable the loading of custom assets in Bat files, which are scripts written for the Bat (Better-Than) batch scripting language. This flag helps prevent unintended execution of external files or scripts that may pose a security risk if they contain malicious code. By default, Bat allows the loading of custom assets using the `@echo off & type <filename>` command. Disabling this feature adds an extra layer of security by preventing such actions.'
        no-lessopen: '[AI] The `bat` is a popular text viewer and editor for the command line, and the option `--no-lessopen` is one of its features. This option prevents `bat` from opening the file in an external editor like Vim or Nano after displaying it. In other words, it keeps the file handling within bat itself.'
        no-pager: |-
            [AI] `bat` is a cat-like file viewer with syntax highlighting and intuitive paging for interactively browsing source code, configuration files, and other text-based data. The option `--no-pager` is used to disable the pager feature of bat.

            When you use `bat <file>` without any options or with other options but not `--no-pager`, bat will display the content of the file in a split view: the left side shows the lines as they appear in the file, and the right side displays the syntax highlighting and other enhancements. Bat also allows you to navigate through the file using arrow keys or page up/down keys.

            However, when you use `bat --no-pager <file>`, bat will not open an interactive viewer for the file. Instead, it will print the content of the file directly to the terminal without syntax highlighting or paging enhancements. This is useful if you prefer to work in a terminal that does not support color and want to quickly check the contents of a file without any additional formatting.
        no-paging: '[AI] The `bat` command is a pager for cat-ing files in your terminal, providing enhanced features like syntax highlighting and scrolling. The `--no-paging` option disables pagination, meaning that the entire file will be printed to the terminal without being split into pages. This can be useful when dealing with small files or when you want to perform other operations on the output, such as redirection or piping.'
        nonprintable-notation: '[AI] The `--nonprintable-notification` flag is a command-line option used in tools like `grep` or `sed`. It prevents the output of non-printable characters, such as tabs and backspaces, from being displayed as escape sequences (e.g., "\t" or "\xXX"). Instead, these invisible characters will be represented as empty spaces or simply not shown in the output at all. This can be useful when dealing with large datasets or files where viewing the actual non-printable characters is not necessary.'
        number: '[AI] The `bat` flag `--number` is used to display line numbers while displaying file content in Bat, a simple CLI tool for Mac and Windows. This option helps developers, testers, or anyone working with text files to easily locate specific lines of code, errors, or changes within their projects.'
        pager: '[AI] The `--pager` flag in the `bat` command is used to control how output is displayed when working with large text files. With this flag, `bat` pipes the output to a pager like `less` or `more`, enabling users to scroll through the content page by page, search for specific text, and navigate using standard keyboard shortcuts. This makes it easier to handle and view large text files in the terminal.'
        paging: '[AI] The `--paging` option in Bat (Bash-like scripting for Windows) is used to enable output paging when the command output exceeds the size of the terminal window. When this option is set, Bat will automatically scroll the terminal screen up to display newer lines as they are printed, making it easier to read and interact with long outputs without having to manually scroll the console.'
        plain: '[AI] The `bat` command with the `--plain` option is a popular text viewer for the terminal in Node.js. With this option, Bat displays text files without any extra formatting or syntax highlighting. In other words, it shows the raw content of the file. This can be useful when you want to quickly check the contents of a file without any additional distractions from colors or other formatting.'
        show-all: '[AI] The `bat` `--show-all` flag is a configuration option for the Bat Cat terminal pager, a popular alternative to `cat` command in Unix-like systems. When used, it displays all files'' contents including hidden and binary data as raw hexadecimal bytes. It is useful when debugging or analyzing low-level data that may not be human-readable in plain text format.'
        style: |-
            [AI] The `--flag` option is not a standard flag in programming or command-line interfaces. The term "bat --style" might be referring to Bat (Better Alternative To Taskmanager), a simple and powerful text-based task manager, which supports various styles for displaying its output.

            The `--style` option is used with Bat to change the appearance of the output. It accepts different values such as "plain", "agile", "context", or "github" to modify the formatting, color scheme, or other visual aspects of the task list.

            For example: `bat list --style github`. In this case, the output will be displayed with GitHub-like styling, making it easier to read and navigate through the tasks.
        tabs: '[AI] The `--tabs` flag in Bat, a PowerShell-inspired batch scripting language, is used to enable or disable tab expansion in the script. When set to `on`, Bat will interpret tabs as expansion of white spaces up to the next tab stop or the end of the line. This can be useful for maintaining consistent indentation and improving the readability of the script. If not specified, this setting defaults to the operating system''s default tab size. When set to `off`, tabs will be treated as regular characters without any special meaning.'
        terminal-width: |-
            [AI] The `--terminal-width` flag is a command-line option used in some Unix-like tools, such as Bat (a cat-like file viewer), to specify the width of the terminal or console window in characters. By default, these tools may not adjust their output to fit the exact size of the terminal window, which can result in truncated lines or wasted space.

            Using `--terminal-width` allows users to provide an explicit value for the terminal width and ensure that the tool's output is optimally displayed within the given dimensions. This flag helps maintain a neat and readable output, especially when dealing with large files or complex data structures.
        theme: '[AI] The `--theme` flag for Bat, a command-line interface tool for Windows, is used to specify the theme or appearance of the application''s user interface (UI). By providing this flag followed by a valid theme name, users can change the look and feel of Bat''s UI, such as color schemes or font styles. This allows for personalization and customization according to individual preferences.'
        unbuffered: '[AI] The `--unbuffered` flag in Bat, a Windows shell scripting language, disables output buffering for the specified command or stream. This means that data is written to the standard output (or error) stream as soon as it is produced by the command, without being collected and written in batches. This can be useful when dealing with streams of data or applications that may be blocked by buffering.'
        version: |-
            [AI] The `bat` is a simple, fast, and modern alternative to `cat` for viewing text files in various formats. The `--version` option when used with `bat` displays the version information of the installed bat application, including its name, version number, and the commit hash or tag if available. For instance, running `bat --version` in a terminal or command prompt would output something like:

            ```
            bat 0.14.3
            Commit: 6c7a82d319b589fba1e365435bc30e1e879c3666
            ```

            This means that the installed `bat` version is 0.14.3, and its corresponding commit hash for this release is `6c7a82d319b589fba1e365435bc30e1e879c3666`.
        wrap: '[AI] `bat` is a popular cat (command-line file viewing) tool for viewing files in various formats. The `--wrap` option is used to set the width of the text output, wrapping long lines to fit within that width. For example, `bat file.txt --wrap=80` will display the contents of `file.txt` with lines wrapped at 80 characters. This can make it easier to read large files on terminal windows with limited widths.'
