documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `goreleaser generate-fig-spec` command is a subcommand used with GoReleaser, a tool for managing the release process of Go projects. Specifically, this command generates Figure spec files, which are used to create platform-specific systemd service files and other system configuration files. These figures help in automating the deployment and management of applications on various platforms using tools like Docker or Kubernetes. By running `generate-fig-spec`, you prepare your Go project for easier containerization and deployment.'
    flag:
        include-hidden: '[AI] `goreleaser` is a tool for managing the release process of Go projects. The command `goreleaser generate-fig-spec --include-hidden` generates a `fig.toml` file, which is used by `docker-compose` to define services and configurations for containerized applications. The `--include-hidden` flag tells `goreleaser` to include files beginning with a dot (`.`) in the generation process. This can be useful when there are configuration files that are not meant to be committed to version control but still needed during the build and deployment process.'
