    command: '[AI] The `glab mr` command is a GitLab CLI (Command Line Interface) tool used to fetch, create, update, or delete Merge Requests in GitLab. It stands for "merge request", and the command itself is used to interact with merge requests programmatically from the terminal. For instance, `glab mr list` displays all open merge requests associated with the current project, or `glab mr create <branch> <commit-message>` creates a new merge request from the given branch and commit message.'
