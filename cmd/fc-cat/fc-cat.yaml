    command: '[AI] `fc-cat` is a command used in the Font Configuration (fcontion) utility of the Linux operating system.

        help: |-
            [AI] `fc-cat` is a command-line utility in the `fontconfig` library used to query and display font information. The `--help` option displays detailed help information about how to use the `fc-match` and `fc-list` subcommands of `fc-cat`. Here's a brief summary:

            * `fc-cat [OPTIONS] [QUERY...]`: This command takes one or more queries as arguments and returns the matching fonts along with detailed information about each font, such as family name, style name, weight, and size.
            * Options include:
              * `--quiet` or `-q`: Suppresses non-error messages.
              * `--lang=LANG`: Sets the language for displaying localized strings (default is system locale).
              * Various filters like `--match=`, `--notmatch=`, and `--list-filters=` to refine search results based on specific font properties.
            * Subcommands are:
              * `fc-cat --list-fonts` or `fc-list fonts`: Lists all available fonts.
              * `fc-cat [QUERY]`: Searches for and displays the matching fonts. For example, you can search by font name (e.g., `fc-cat Times New Roman`) or other properties like style (e.g., `fc-cat "Italic"`).

            For detailed usage examples and options, run `fc-cat --help` in your terminal.
        recurse: '[AI] `fc-cat --recurse` is a command used in the Font Config (fc) utility of the Fontconfig library in Linux and Unix systems. This command recursively lists all the font files located in a specified directory and its subdirectories, displaying their file paths and other relevant information such as family names and weights. It helps users to manage and locate font files easily.'
        verbose: '[AI] `fc-cat --verbose` is a command used in the `fontconfig` library for managing fonts in Linux and Unix systems. The `fc-cat` utility is used to query font databases and display information about specific font files or families. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output, providing more detailed information about each font file or family, including the font name, family name, style, size range, and weight.'
        version: '[AI] `fc-cat --version` is a command used in the Fedora and Red Hat Linux distributions to display the version information of the "fc-cat" utility, which is a component of the Font Config library. This command helps users check if they have the latest version or not, for the purpose of ensuring compatibility with other software and maintaining system updates.'
