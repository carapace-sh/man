documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tee` is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It reads input from a pipeline or a file, and can output it to both the standard output (terminal) and one or more files. This makes it useful for viewing and saving the output of commands at the same time. The syntax is usually `cmd | tee filename`. If multiple output files are specified, each gets a unique suffix starting with ''_'' appended to the base name.'
    flag:
        append: '[AI] `tee` is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems for reading from a pipeline, writing the input to one or more files, and displaying it on the terminal in real time. The `--append` option tells `tee` to open the output file(s) in append mode, meaning that new content will be added at the end of the existing data in each file instead of overwriting it from the beginning. This is useful when you want to save a copy of your command''s output while still seeing it on the terminal as it is being produced.'
        help: '[AI] `tee --help` is a command in Unix-like operating systems used to read input from a pipeline and write it to both standard output (the terminal) and a file. The `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use the `tee` command, including available options, examples, and usage notes. It''s particularly helpful for users who need a quick reference or are new to the `tee` command.'
        ignore-interrupts: '[AI] The `tee --ignore-interrupts` command is a utility in Unix and Linux systems used to read data from a pipeline and write it to both standard output (usually the terminal) and a file, creating or appending to the file as necessary. The `--ignore-interrupts` option is specifically meant to prevent the tee process from being terminated by signals such as INT or TERM, which are typically used for interrupting foreground processes in a terminal. This can be useful when you want to ensure that data is written to a file even if other processes or the user attempting to interact with the terminal try to stop it.'
        output-error: '[AI] The `tee` command in Unix is used to read input and either write it to a file or display it on the terminal in real time. The `--output-error` option is used to specify that any errors that occur during the execution of a piped command should be written to the standard error stream instead of being hidden. This can be useful for debugging purposes as it allows you to see any error messages produced by the commands in the pipeline.'
        p: '[AI] The `tee` command with the `-p` option in Unix or Linux is used to both display the input real-time on the terminal and save the same input into a file. It acts as a pipe where output from one command is passed to another, but with the added functionality of saving the output to a file. This can be useful for viewing and storing the output of commands or scripts in a file simultaneously.'
        version: '[AI] The `tee` command with the `--version` option is used to display the version information of the `tee` utility installed on your system. When you run this command in a terminal or command prompt, it will output the name of the `tee` program followed by its version number and any other relevant build information, such as compilation date or operating system. This helps users to check if they have the latest version of `tee`, troubleshoot potential compatibility issues, or simply for informational purposes.'
