documentation:
    command: '[AI] ClamD is a popular open-source antivirus engine used in various security software solutions. It''s designed to scan files for viruses and other malware in real time or on-demand. The name "ClamD" refers to its original creator, the CLAM AntiVirus project. This engine functions as a daemon, constantly monitoring system activity for potential threats and scanning files accordingly. It uses various antivirus databases for definition updates.'
    flag:
        config-file: '[AI] The `clamd` is a daemon (background process) for Clam Antivirus, an open-source antivirus engine used to scan files and e-mails for viruses and other malware. The option `--config-file` is used to specify the path of the configuration file for `clamd`. This file contains various settings that customize the behavior of `clamd`, such as the location of the Virus Definition File (vdfiles), logging options, and maximum scanning thread count. By using this option, system administrators can tailor the antivirus scanning process to their specific environment.'
        debug: '[AI] `clamd --debug` is a command-line argument used with ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine. This argument enables the most extensive level of debugging output, providing detailed information about the scanning process and various events that occur within the ClamAV daemon (clamd) during a virus scan. The debug output can help in troubleshooting issues, analyzing performance, or understanding the inner workings of ClamAV.'
        foreground: '[AI] The `clamd` command with the `--foreground` option is used to run the Clam Antivirus daemon in the foreground mode instead of as a background service. This means that the scanning process will not detach from the terminal and will continue to display progress updates and other information on the console. The primary advantage of using this flag is for troubleshooting or performing one-off scans where real-time feedback is necessary. It''s important to note that if you want to run `clamd` as a background service, you should not use this flag and instead use an init script or systemd unit file to start it in the background.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `clamd` is a daemon (background process) for the Clam Antivirus software. The `--help` option, when used with `clamd`, displays a brief help message that includes the following information:

            * A short usage description of the command
            * Options and their meanings:
              + `--BGD`: Runs ClamAV daemon in the background
              + `--Foreground`: Runs ClamAV daemon in foreground (interactively)
              + `--LogFile LOGFILE`: Specifies log file for daemon's output
              + `--Port PORT`: Sets port number for external communication
            * The default configuration and behavior of the daemon.

            Using this command without other arguments displays a simple usage message with the most common options. For more detailed information, you may need to consult the ClamAV documentation or man pages.
        log: '[AI] `clamd --log` is a command-line option for Clam Antivirus daemon (clamd). It enables and specifies the log file where clamd will record its activities, such as scanning results and system messages. The format of the log file can be set to text or syslog using options like `--logfile` and `--syslog`, respectively. Enabling logs can help in troubleshooting and monitoring the antivirus scanning process.'
        version: '[AI] `clamd --version` is a command used in Unix-based systems to check the version information of the Clam Antivirus daemon (clamd). When executed, it prints out the name, version number, and other relevant information about the installed ClamAV antivirus engine. This can be helpful for checking if an upgrade or downgrade is needed, or for troubleshooting issues related to the ClamAV daemon.'
