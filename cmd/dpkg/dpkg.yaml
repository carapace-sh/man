documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dpkg` is a package management tool used in Debian-based Linux distributions. It stands for "Debian Package" and manages the installation, removal, and maintenance of software packages in the form of DEB files. `dpkg` processes the package files, extracts them, and configures the installed software. It also handles dependency resolution, which ensures that a package can be installed only if all its required dependencies are met. Additionally, it provides information about installed packages, such as their versions and status.'
