    --no-trunc: Don't truncate output
    --orphans: Include orphaned services (not declared by project)
    --services: Display services
    --status*=: 'Filter services by status. Values: [paused | restarting | removing | running | dead | created | exited]'

    -q, --quiet: Only display IDs
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker-compose ps` is a command used with Docker Compose to display the status of services and containers defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. It lists the name, image, state (running, exited, etc.), and ports for each service and associated container. This command helps in quickly checking the current state of your Docker application stack.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `docker-compose ps --all` is a command used with Docker Compose to list all containers created by your Compose files, including both running and stopped ones. The `--all` flag extends the default output to include containers that are no longer running but were managed by Compose at some point in their lifecycle. This command helps you get an overview of your application''s container landscape and monitor their statuses.'
        filter: '[AI] `docker-compose ps --filter` is a command used in Docker Compose to filter and display the running containers based on specific conditions. The `ps` subcommand lists the currently running services and their associated containers, while the `--filter` option allows you to apply filters to refine the output. With this command, you can specify various filters such as name, status, or label to match and display only the desired containers. For example, `docker-compose ps --filter "name=my-service"` will show you only the containers associated with the service named ''my-service''.'
        format: |-
            [AI] `docker-compose ps --format` is a command used with Docker Compose to list the running containers and services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. The `--format` option allows customizing the output format of this command, which can be useful for automating or analyzing the results.

            For example, you might use `--format 'table {{.Name}}: {{.State}}'` to display a table of container names and their current state (running, exited, etc.) or `--format json` to output the results in JSON format for further processing. The exact format string depends on your specific use case and desired output format.
        no-trunc: '[AI] `docker-compose ps --no-trunc` is a command used with Docker Compose to list all the running containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. The `--no-trunc` flag prevents the output from being truncated, meaning you will see the full container names and service labels instead of just the first few words. This command helps users get a clearer view of their running services for better management and troubleshooting.'
        orphans: '[AI] The `docker-compose ps --orphans` command displays the containers created by Docker Compose that do not have any associated service. In other words, it lists the containers that were created as dependencies of a service but are still running even if that service has been stopped or removed. This can be useful in managing container resources and ensuring that dependent containers are properly terminated.'
        quiet: '[AI] `docker-compose ps --quiet` is a command used with Docker Compose to list the running services and containers in a quiet mode. Quiet mode means that only the necessary information for identification is displayed, such as service or container name and status (running or stopped). This command is useful when you need to process the output of the command programmatically, instead of viewing it in the terminal.'
        services: '[AI] `docker-compose ps --services` is a command used with Docker Compose to display the status of all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. This command lists each service along with its current state (running, starting, stopping, or error), and additional information such as the container ID, image, and port mapping if applicable. It provides an overview of the running application composition in a single glance.'
        status: '[AI] `docker-compose ps --status` is a command used to display the status of services defined in a Docker Compose file. The `--status` option shows the current state (running, starting, stopping, or error) of each service. This command helps monitor and troubleshoot your multi-container applications easily.'
