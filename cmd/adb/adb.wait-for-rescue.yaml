description: wait for device to be in given state
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `adb wait-for-rescue` command is used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to initiate a device rescue operation, which is started when a device becomes unresponsive or is stuck in a bootloop. It sends a signal to the Android system to request it to start the rescue mode, allowing the user to perform advanced troubleshooting and recovery actions using ADB tools. Once initiated, you can use other ADB commands like `adb shell` or `adb reboot` to interact with the device during the rescue mode session.'
