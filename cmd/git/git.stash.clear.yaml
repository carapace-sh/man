documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git stash clear` is a Git command used to remove all applied stashes from the stash list but not yet pushed to the remote repository. In other words, it deletes local stashed changes without applying them back to the working directory or the current branch. This command is helpful when you have multiple stashes and want to clean up your stash list without keeping certain changes.'
