documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm get` command is used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager) to download and install the latest version of a specified package, but without saving it as a dependency in the `package.json` file. This means that the package will not be included when running `npm install`. It''s useful for manually updating packages before testing or debugging, without changing the project''s dependencies list.'
