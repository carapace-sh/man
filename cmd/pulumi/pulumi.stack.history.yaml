    command: '[AI] `pulumi stack history` is a command provided by Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform, to display the commit history of a specific stack. A stack in Pulumi represents a collection of related resources and configurations that are deployed together. By running `stack history`, you can view the Git commits or other changes that have affected the resources in your stack, along with information like author, date, and message. This command helps in tracking the versioning and changes made over time to your infrastructure configuration.'

The `--show-secsrets` option displays redacted versions of any sensitive data that was previously input as environment variables or configuration files when creating or updating resources in Pulumi. This command helps in tracking changes to secrets over time and ensures that only authorized users have access to the encrypted data.'
