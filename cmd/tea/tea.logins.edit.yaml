    command: '[AI] The `tea logins edit` command is used in the TEA (The Hierarchy and Access Control) tool for managing user access to files and directories in a Linux system with SELinux enabled. This command allows you to modify existing user login mappings for SELinux subjects, which are typically processes or users. The changes made will affect how those subjects are labeled and accessed by the SELinux policy.'

        output: |-
            [AI] The command `tea logins edit --output` is a part of the Tea (Temporal Access Control) tool, which is used to manage access control policies for time-series data in infrastructure and observability platforms.

            This specific command is responsible for editing an existing login configuration within Tea. It takes no arguments by default, as it assumes you will provide the necessary login information interactively during the editing process. The `--output` flag is used to specify the format of the output after making changes. Commonly used formats include "json" or "table". When run without any other flags, this command will simply display the edited login configuration in your terminal.
