documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `jj` command with the `interdiff` argument is a Vim plugin that helps compare and merge changes between two text files. It sets up Vim to behave like the Unified Diff tool when editing files. When you open or split edit two files, Vim will show the differences in a side-by-side or context diff format, allowing you to navigate, copy, delete, or accept/reject changes using familiar Vim commands. To use it, ensure `jj` is installed and add `Plugin ''scrooloose/nerddiff''` to your Vim configuration file, then run `:JJInterDiffToggle` in Vim to start the comparison.'
    flag:
        color-words: '[AI] `jj interdiff` is a command used in the JavaScript coding environment, Jupyter Jupyter, for comparing and merging differences between two text files or buffers. The `--color-words` flag is an optional argument that enables the use of colored syntax highlighting for words added or removed during the diffing process. This can make it easier to visually identify and understand the changes being made.'
        from: '[AI] The `jj interdiff` command is a tool used in the Jupyter Notebook environment for comparing differences between two versions of Jupyter notebooks or between a notebook and its corresponding Git repository. The option `--from` specifies the source of the comparison, indicating which version or commit should be considered as the base or reference. In other words, it tells `jj interdiff` to show the differences that have been made since the specified source.'
        git: |-
            [AI] The `jj interdiff --git` command is a feature of J ircle, a popular Git interface and plugin for the JetBrains IntelliJ IDEs. This command displays an interactive diff that shows the changes between two Git branches or commits in a more visual and user-friendly way than the standard Git diff tool.

            The `--git` option specifies that the difference should be calculated based on the differences in the Git repository, rather than from files stored locally in your project. The `interdiff` part of the command enables interactive navigation between the changeset and the context of the differences, allowing users to easily review and compare the modifications side by side.
        help: '[AI] The command `jj interdiff --help` is related to JJ, a Git-like version control system for JavaScript projects developed by Microsoft. The `interdiff` subcommand is used to show the difference between two branches or commits in your JJ repository. The `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use this specific command, including any required arguments, optional flags, and their descriptions. It''s essentially a request for help on using the `jj interdiff` command effectively.'
        stat: '[AI] The command `jj interdiff --stat` is used with the Jupyter Notebook editor, Jupyter-jupyter, to display a statistic comparison of two branches or commits of a Git repository in the Interactive Difference (interdiff) view. The output shows the number of added, modified, and deleted lines for each file within the difference. This information helps identify changes between versions at a glance.'
        summary: |-
            [AI] The `jj interdiff` command is a tool used for comparing and merging differences between JSON files or data structures in JavaScript. The option `--summary` generates a summary of the changes detected by the command without actually applying them.

            Here's a brief explanation:

            1. `jj`: It refers to the Javascript-diff library, which is used for performing difference computations between two JavaScript objects or arrays.
            2. `interdiff`: This is the specific command within the library that computes the differences between two JSON schemas (or data structures), instead of plain JSON data.
            3. `--summary`: This option generates a succinct list of changes as output, instead of applying them and showing the resulting difference objects. It's helpful for understanding what changes need to be made without actually implementing them in code.
        to: '[AI] The `jj interdiff --to` command is used in the Jupyter Notebook editor, Jupyter-joslyn, to compare and display the differences between two versions of a Jupyter notebook file. The `--to` option specifies the revision or commit identifier of the later version to be compared against the current working directory notebook. The tool highlights additions, deletions, and modifications in both files side by side, helping users identify changes made between the two versions.'
        tool: '[AI] The `jj interdiff --tool` command is a part of Jupyter Jupyter''s `jj` toolkit for managing Jupyter Notebook projects. The `interdiff` subcommand compares and shows the differences between two versions of a Jupyter Notebook or a pair of cells within the same notebook. The `--tool` option specifies that this command should use an external diff tool, such as Unified Diff or Beyond Compare, to display the differences visually. This can be useful when comparing large or complex notebooks, where the visual representation of changes can aid in understanding and merging differences.'
        types: |-
            [AI] The `jj interdiff --types` command is a part of Jupyter's Jupytertools library for comparing and merging differences between two or more Jupyter Notebook files.

            The `--types` option specifies the types of differences to display: cells, metadata, or both. Cell differences include changes in code, markdown text, and input/output displays. Metadata differences encompass all non-cell information such as notebook properties, cell indexes, and header information.

            For example, running `jj interdiff --types cells mynotebook1.ipynb mynotebook2.ipynb` will show only the differences in the contents of the cells between the two notebooks. Using `--types all` or simply omitting `--types` will display both cell and metadata differences.
