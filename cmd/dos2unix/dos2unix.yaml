    command: '[AI] `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files with DOS line endings (CRLF) into Unix format line endings (LF). It''s primarily used in Unix-based systems, and its application simplifies the editing of cross-platform text files, ensuring consistency between different operating systems.'
    flag:
        "7": |-
            [AI] The `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats, primarily DOS (CR+LF) and Unix (LF). The option `-7` passed with the `dos2unix` command is related to the IBM EBCDIC encoding scheme.

            IBM EBCDIC is a character encoding scheme used by IBM mainframe systems, in which a byte can represent different characters depending on its position within the 256-byte range. With the `-7` option, `dos2unix` converts text files with EBCDIC line endings (CR+LF or CR only) to Unix format LF only, making them compatible with most modern systems and applications.

            In summary, the command `dos2unix -7` is used to convert text files from IBM EBCDIC line ending format to Unix format.
        add-bom: '[AI] The `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats: DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). The option `--add-bom` instructs the tool to add a Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the file when converting from DOS to Unix format. A BOM is a special character sequence that indicates the byte order (endianness) and encoding of a file, in this case UTF-8 with a BOM. So, `dos2unix --add-bom` ensures that after conversion from DOS to Unix format, the resulting file will be marked as UTF-8 encoded with a BOM at its beginning.'
        allow-chown: '[AI] `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats, namely DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). The option `--allow-chown` is not a flag that directly modifies the behavior of `dos2unix`. Instead, it''s a permission flag that can be set in conjunction with the `sudo` command when running `dos2unix`, allowing the command to change file ownership (chown) if needed. This is useful when running `dos2unix` as a different user than the one who owns the files, ensuring proper file permissions after conversion.'
        convmode: |-
            [AI] `dos2unix` is a utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats, namely DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). The `--convmode` option specifies the conversion mode to be used:

            * With `--dos`, it converts Unix files to DOS format by adding Carriage Return (CR) characters before each Line Feed (LF) character.
            * With `--unix`, it converts DOS files to Unix format by removing Carriage Return (CR) characters.
            * Without any mode specified, it assumes the default conversion which is to convert DOS files to Unix format.

            So in summary, the `--convmode` option in `dos2unix` allows you to explicitly specify the desired line ending format conversion: DOS to Unix (`--unix`) or Unix to DOS (`--dos`).
        display-enc: '[AI] `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats: DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). The option `--display-enc` is not a standard option for this tool, but it can be implemented as an extension. It''s used to display the current encoding of the file being processed without performing any conversion. This information can be useful when working with files that may have incorrectly reported encoding or need to ensure compatibility before applying line ending conversions.'
        follow-symlink: '[AI] `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats, specifically between DOS (CR+LF) and Unix (LF) formats. The option `--follow-symlink` tells the command to apply the conversion not only on regular files but also on symbolic links. This means that if a directory contains both regular files and symbolic links, applying the dos2unix command with this option ensures all files under the directory, regardless of their type, are converted to the specified line ending format.'
        force: '[AI] `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF) line endings. The `--force` option is used with this tool to automatically convert all files in the specified directory recursively, without asking for confirmation before overwriting existing files. Essentially, it ensures that all files under the given directory have Unix-style line endings by overwriting any existing files that may have DOS line endings.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `dos2unix` is a command-line utility for converting text files between DOS and Unix formats. Its help option, `--help`, provides brief information about how to use it. Here's a summary:

            `dos2unix --help` displays a usage message that includes:

            1. A brief description of the tool.
            2. Syntax for using it with and without options. For example: `dos2unix [OPTION]... FILE...`.
            3. List of available options:
               * `-a, --all`: Convert all files in a directory and its subdirectories recursively.
               * `-c, --force`: Overwrite existing files without asking for confirmation.
               * `--help`: Display this help message and exit.
               * `--version`: Print the version number and exit.
            4. An explanation of each option, e.g., "Convert all files in a directory and its subdirectories recursively." for the `-a` option.
            5. Instructions to report bugs or request features.
        info: '[AI] `dos2unix --info` is a command used in Unix-based systems to display information about a file''s line ending format. The `dos2unix` utility is typically used for converting files between different line ending formats, such as DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). When used with the `--info` option, it reports the current format of a file without making any conversions. The output will indicate whether the file uses DOS or Unix line endings.'
        keep-bom: '[AI] `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats, primarily between DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). The option `--keep-bom` is used with this tool to preserve the Byte Order Mark (BOM) during the conversion process. A BOM is an invisible character sequence that indicates the byte order of a file, usually UTF-8 or UTF-16. Preserving the BOM is important for specific applications such as Microsoft Excel, where it signals the encoding of the data. So with the `dos2unix --keep-bom` command, you can convert line endings while keeping the file''s original byte order mark.'
        keep-utf16: '[AI] The `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats, primarily DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). The option `--keep-utf16` is used with this tool to preserve UTF-16 encoding when converting line endings. In other words, it ensures that the Unix line endings (LF) are added without disrupting the UTF-16 character encoding in the file.'
        keepdate: '[AI] `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats: DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). The option `--keepdate` is used to preserve the original creation and modification timestamps of the file during the conversion process. This means that the date and time information associated with the file will not be changed, making it useful for ensuring consistency across large collections of files or when transferring files between different systems.'
        license: '[AI] The `dos2unix --license` command is used to display the license terms for the `dos2unix` utility, which is a common Unix text file conversion tool used to convert text files between different line ending formats such as DOS and UNIX. This command does not modify any files but instead outputs the text of the license in the terminal or console. The license specifies the terms under which the software can be used, distributed, and modified.'
        newfile: '[AI] The `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats, namely DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). When using the `--newfile` option with `dos2unix`, it creates a new, converted file without overwriting the original one. Instead, it generates a file with a unique name appended with a timestamp or a sequence number to avoid overwriting existing files. For example: `dos2unix --newfile input.txt output.txt`.'
        newline: '[AI] `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats: CRLF (Carriage Return and Line Feed, used by DOS/Windows) and LF (Line Feed, used by Unix/Linux). The `--newline` option tells `dos2unix` to convert files from DOS format (CRLF) to Unix format (LF). In summary, it converts line endings from DOS format to Unix format.'
        no-allow-chown: '[AI] The `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats: DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). The `--no-allow-chown` option is one of its flags, which disables the permission to change file ownership during the conversion process. This flag is useful when you want to ensure that the file ownership remains unchanged while performing the line ending conversion.'
        oldfile: '[AI] `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats: DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). The option `--oldfile` is used to specify that the original DOS-formatted file should be kept as a backup with the suffix `.~e`, where `e` is the name of the input file. This way, if there are any issues with the conversion, the original file can be easily restored.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats: DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). The `--quiet` option is used with this tool to suppress informational messages during the conversion process, making the operation run silently.'
        remove-bom: '[AI] `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats: DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). The `--remove-bom` option instructs the tool to not only convert line endings but also remove the Unix Byte Order Mark (BOM) if it exists in a file. This ensures that the text data starts at the very first byte of the file, which is crucial for some applications, like certain versions of Microsoft Excel and SQL databases.'
        safe: '[AI] The `dos2unix --safe` command is a utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats: DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). The `--safe` option is a safety feature designed to prevent data loss when converting files that may contain embedded CRLF sequences that are not intended to represent line breaks. With this option, `dos2unix` will only convert the EOL (End of Line) characters and leave other CRLF sequences untouched. This is useful for ensuring that scripts or configuration files with mixed line ending formats remain functional after conversion.'
        skip-symlink: |-
            [AI] The `dos2unix` command is a utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats, primarily between DOS (CR+LF) and Unix (LF) formats.

            The option `--skip-symlink` instructs the command not to process symbolic links during file conversion. This means that only regular files will be processed by the `dos2unix` command, leaving symbolic links untouched in their original format.
        verbose: '[AI] `dos2unix` is a command-line utility used to convert text files between different line ending formats: DOS (CRLF) and Unix (LF). The `--verbose` option increases the level of output information provided by the command. When you run `dos2unix --verbose filename`, it will display detailed information about the conversion process, such as the name of the file being processed, the original line ending format, and the number of lines that have been converted.'
        version: |-
            [AI] The command `dos2unix --version` is used to check the version information of the `dos2unix` utility, which is a text file converter that converts text files between different line ending formats, specifically between DOS (CR+LF) and Unix (LF) line endings. When you run this command in a terminal or command prompt, it will display output similar to the following:

            ```
            dos2unix (portable) 5.21-3
            ```

            This output indicates that the version of `dos2unix` being used is 5.21-3. The version number may vary depending on which specific implementation or distribution of `dos2unix` you are using.
