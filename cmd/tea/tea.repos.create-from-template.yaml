documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea repos create-from-template` command is used in the TEA (Terraform Enterprise API) CLI to create a new Terraform repository from an existing template. This command takes the name of the new repository and the ID or URL of the template repository as arguments, and sets up the necessary infrastructure in your TFE account to manage the new repository based on the specified template. It is typically used when you want to create a new repository with a consistent configuration based on an existing one.'
    flag:
        avatar: '[AI] The command `tea repos create-from-template --avatar` is a command used in the TeaDB database management system. It creates a new repository using an existing template and sets an avatar image for the repository. This can be useful when setting up multiple repositories with similar configurations or branding. The `--avatar` option allows you to specify the path to an image file, which will be used as the avatar for the newly created repository.'
        content: '[AI] The `tea repos create-from-template --content` command is used to create a new Git repository in TEA (TeamEngine Accelerator) with content from an existing repository, using a template as a base. This command automates the process of creating a new repo and populating it with files from another repo. The `--content` option specifies that the new repo should include all the files in the source repository.'
        description: '[AI] The command `tea repos create-from-template --description` is used in the Tea interface for GitOps management to create a new repository template from an existing one. The `--description` flag provides a brief description or label for the new template, helping to differentiate it from other templates during selection.'
        githooks: |-
            [AI] The `tea repos create-from-template --githooks` command is a part of the Teapot CLI (Command Line Interface) tool used in the Tectonic platform by Red Hat. This command creates a new Git repository using an existing template and enables Git hooks.

            Git hooks are custom scripts that automatically run when specific events occur in the Git repository, such as before or after committing or receiving new branches. These hooks can be used to enforce policies or perform additional tasks, providing an extra layer of security or convenience for the development workflow.

            In summary, `tea repos create-from-template --githooks` creates a new Git repository using a specified template and enables Git hooks to run on that repository.
        labels: '[AI] The `tea repos create-from-template --labels` command is a part of the Tea (Terraform Enterprise API) CLI (Command Line Interface). It creates a new Git repository template, which can be used to instantiate new repositories with predefined configuration and labels. The `--labels` option allows specifying one or more labels for the new template. These labels help in categorizing and filtering templates within Tea later.'
        login: |-
            [AI] `tea` is a command-line tool for managing templates and projects in GitHub's Teraform Cloud (formerly known as Atlas). The specific command `tea repos create-from-template --login` does the following:

            1. Logs you into your Teraform Cloud account, if not already logged in.
            2. Creates a new repository using an existing template.
            3. Initializes the newly created repository with the specified template's files and configurations.
        name: '[AI] The command `tea repos create-from-template --name` is used in the TeaVM (Tea Virtual Machine) toolkit to create a new repository from an existing template. The `--name` option specifies the desired name for the new repository. This command does not create any files or initialize the repository; it only sets up the repository structure based on the specified template.'
        output: '[AI] `tea` is a command-line tool used in the Terraform ecosystem for managing templates and generating Terraform configuration files. The specific command `tea repos create-from-template --output` creates a new repository template using an existing one as a base. The `--output` flag is used to specify the name of a file where the output of the operation will be written, typically in JSON format, containing information about the newly created template.'
        owner: |-
            [AI] The command `tea repos create-from-template --owner` is a part of the Tea (Temporal Effective Application) CLI, used to create a new repository in Tea based on an existing template with a specific owner.

            The `create-from-template` subcommand creates a new repository from a given template. The `--owner` flag sets the owner of the new repository. Together, this command allows users to quickly and easily set up a new repository, including its initial structure and configuration, while also specifying who will be responsible for it.
        private: |-
            [AI] The command `tea repos create-from-template --private` is used to create a new Teaspoon repository in Terraform using a template, with the option for the repository to be private. Here's a breakdown of the components:

            * `tea`: This refers to Teaspoon, an open-source library for Terraform modules that simplifies the process of creating, publishing, and discovering modules.
            * `repos`: This is the subcommand used for managing repositories in Teaspoon.
            * `create-from-template`: This specific subcommand creates a new repository based on an existing template.
            * `--private`: This flag indicates that the newly created repository should be private, meaning it can only be accessed by authenticated users or collaborators with appropriate permissions.
        template: '[AI] The `tea repos create-from-template --template` command is used to create a new Tea (Tectonic Ergo Autopilot) repository from an existing template. This command takes the name of the new repository as an argument and the `--template` option specifies the name or URL of the template to use for creating the new repository. The result is a newly created repository with the same structure, configuration, and files as the specified template.'
        topics: '[AI] The `tea repos create-from-template --topics` command is used in the Teapot CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for managing GitOps workflows with Kubernetes using Tectonic or Argo. This command creates a new repository using an existing template and sets the given topics for the GitHub or GitLab repository associated with it. The `--topics` flag specifies one or more topic names, which define the scope of events that will trigger GitOps workflow updates in your Kubernetes cluster.'
        webhooks: '[AI] The `tea repos create-from-template --webhooks` command is used in the Tectonic (now OpenShift) CLI to create a new GitRepository object with a specified name and template, and enable webhook integration for that repository. When you use this command, a new repository is created based on an existing repository''s configuration as a template, and webhooks are configured to send events to the OpenShift cluster when changes occur in the linked Git repository. This allows for automatic deployment of applications whenever changes are pushed to the linked Git repository.'
