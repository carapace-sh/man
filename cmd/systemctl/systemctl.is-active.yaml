    command: '[AI] `systemctl is-active` is a command used in Linux systems with Systemd init system to check the current status of a given service or target, i.e., whether it''s active (running), inactive (not running but can be started), or in a transition state. The command returns an exit code indicating the status: 0 for active, 1 for inactive, and other values for various transitional states. For example, `systemctl is-active myservice` would return "active (running)" if the service is currently running, and "inactive" otherwise.'
