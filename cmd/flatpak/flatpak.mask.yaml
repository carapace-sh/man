    command: '[AI] `flatpak mask` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager to control application sandboxing and access to system resources. By applying a mask, you can add or remove capabilities for a specific Flatpak application. Masks can be used to allow or deny network access, adjust file and directory permissions, enable or disable hardware access, and more. This command modifies the current mask of an installed application, and does not install or remove any applications.'
    flag:
        help: |-
            [AI] `flatpak mask` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The `--help` option is used to display detailed help information about using this specific command with Flatpak. Here's what you can expect:

            1. **Description:** An introductory sentence explaining the purpose of the command, which in this case is to modify application masks.
            2. **Usage:** A brief usage syntax explaining how to call the command followed by its arguments. For example: `flatpak mask [OPTIONS] APPLICATION [MASK]...`
            3. **Options:** Detailed descriptions of various optional parameters that can be used with the command, such as `--install`, `--remove`, `--list`, or `--all`.
            4. **Examples:** Simple examples demonstrating how to use the command for different scenarios. For instance: `flatpak mask --install org.example.app.xyz` (installs a mask on an application) and `flatpak mask --remove org.example.app.xyz` (removes a mask from an application).
            5. **Bugs:** Contact information for reporting any bugs or issues encountered while using the command.
        installation: '[AI] `flatpak mask --installation` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. It modifies the installation flags of a specific Flatpak application or runtime. The "--installation" flag specifically refers to controlling whether the installed packages can be automatically updated or not. By using `mask --installation <application/runtime> enable` or `disable`, you can respectively allow or prevent automatic updates for the selected package. This command is helpful for managing application stability and security by allowing fine-grained control over which packages receive automatic updates.'
        ostree-verbose: |-
            [AI] `flatpak mask` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The `--ostree-verbose` option is used with this command to control the way OSTree (a versioned filesystem and thin-client checkout tool) behaves when applying or removing masks for Flatpak applications.

            A mask in Flatpak is a configuration file that controls which runtimes, extensions, and application versions are installed or hidden for a given application. The `mask --ostree-verbose` command displays detailed information about the filesystem changes made by applying or removing masks. It lists the added, removed, or modified files under each component (runtimes, extensions, etc.) in a verbose format. This can be useful when debugging issues related to masking in Flatpak and OSTree.
        remove: '[AI] `flatpak mask --remove` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment platform. This command is used to remove masks from an installed Flatpak application. Masks are used to enable or disable specific features of an application, such as access to the host system''s file system or network. Removing a mask allows the corresponding feature to be disabled for the application.'
        system: |-
            [AI] `flatpak mask` is a command-line utility for managing Flatpak application sandboxes. The `--system` option specifies that the operation should be performed on system (global) installations rather than user installations.

            The `mask` subcommand is used to apply or remove masks, which are flags that modify the behavior of a Flatpak application. Applying a mask using `flatpak mask --system <application> mask-name` enables the specified mask for all installed instances of the given application on the system.

            In summary, `flatpak mask --system` followed by an application name and mask-name allows you to enable or disable specific masks for system-wide Flatpak applications.
        user: |-
            [AI] `flatpak mask` is a command-line utility for Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. The `--user` option in this command modifies application sandboxing settings for a specific application or its runtime, allowing or denying access to certain user-specific directories and permissions.

            When used with the `--user add <directory>` subcommand, it grants the specified directory access to the user's Flatpak applications. Conversely, using `--user remove <directory>` will revoke access. The masking process affects only the current user and does not affect system-wide settings or other users.
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak mask` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output produced by the command. When you run `flatpak mask --verbose`, it will display detailed information about the masking operation being performed. A mask in Flatpak context refers to a mechanism that allows hiding specific features or capabilities from a Flatpak application, without uninstalling it entirely. The verbose output includes details such as the application ID being masked, the specific masks being applied, and any error messages if applicable.'
