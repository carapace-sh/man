    command: '[AI] `flatpak document-export` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to export a document or a specific application''s state into a JSON format. This can be helpful for debugging, backup, or migration purposes. The exported data can later be imported using the `flatpak document-import` command.'
    flag:
        allow-delete: '[AI] `flatpak document-export` is a command-line tool used in the Flatpak application packaging system to generate a human-readable description of installed applications and their files. The `--allow-delete` option permits the removal of exported files after they have been generated, making it safer to use this command in scripts or automated workflows without worrying about unintended side effects from keeping the exported files.'
        allow-grant-permission: |-
            [AI] `flatpak document-export` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. This command exports an application's files or directories into a new archive for backup, sharing, or other purposes.

            The `--allow-grant-permission` option grants specific permissions to the exported documents or directories when they are installed in another system. These permissions can include access to network locations, hardware devices, or other applications' data. By using this flag, you explicitly allow these permissions during the export process and make them available to the imported application. This is an essential security consideration when sharing applications between systems.
        allow-read: '[AI] The `flatpak document-export --allow-read` command is used to export a Flatpak application''s configuration data as a JSON file. The `--allow-read` flag grants read access to the application''s files and directories, allowing the exported data to include paths to those files. This flag ensures that the exported data contains complete and accurate information about the application''s setup.'
        allow-write: '[AI] `flatpak document-export` is a command-line tool in Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. This specific command exports a document or application data to a given location using the `--allow-write` option grants the necessary permissions for the operation to write files outside of the application sandbox. In other words, it enables the exported data to be saved permanently beyond the scope of the application''s isolated environment.'
        app: '[AI] The `flatpak document-export --app` command is a utility used in Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. This command exports an application''s metadata documents as plain text files. The option `--app` specifies that the metadata of a single application should be exported instead of multiple applications or the system-wide metadata. The output files will contain information about the application, such as its name, description, dependencies, and permissions. These documents can be used for various purposes like reviewing an application''s details, sharing or archiving application configurations, or creating custom scripts and tools based on the data in the exported documents.'
        forbid-delete: '[AI] The `flatpak document-export --forbid-delete` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. This command exports application data into various formats (like JSON or XML) with an added flag `--forbid-delete`. This flag prevents the deletion of the exported data after the operation is completed, ensuring the data remains available for future use.'
        forbid-grant-permission: '[AI] `flatpak document-export` is a command-line utility for exporting application data as a document in various formats, such as JSON or XML. The option `--forbid-grant-permission` restricts the exported document from requesting any additional permissions during its use. This means that the document cannot ask for access to resources outside of its own sandboxed environment, ensuring improved security and privacy.'
        forbid-read: '[AI] The `--forbid-read` option in the `flatpak document-export` command is used to prevent exported documents from including read access to specific directories or files during runtime. This can help enhance security by limiting what data a Flatpak application can access when using exported documents. The flag does not allow any read access to specified paths, effectively denying the application from reading the content of those paths.'
        forbid-write: '[AI] `flatpak document-export` is a command-line tool used in the Flatpak application packaging system to export application metadata into various formats, such as `.flatpakref` or `.desktop`. The option `--forbid-write` is added to restrict this command from creating or modifying any files during its execution. This ensures that no unintended changes are made to the system and maintains a consistent state.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `flatpak document-export --help` command is used to export Flatpak application documents into various formats such as JSON or YAML, for further processing or analysis. The `--help` option displays the available options and usage information for this command.

            Here's a brief overview of its syntax:

            1. `flatpak`: This is the name of the Flatpak command-line interface tool.
            2. `document-export`: A subcommand under Flatpak that exports various documents, like application metadata or repository information.
            3. `--help`: An option that displays detailed help for this command, including available options and usage examples.
        noexist: '[AI] `flatpak document-export` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The `--noexist` option is used to request the export of metadata for non-existent documents or applications. In simpler terms, this command exports the metadata information for an absent (nonexistent) document or application, which can be useful when dealing with missing or not yet installed packages in a Flatpak environment.'
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak document-export` is a command-line utility used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux and other Unix systems. This specific command exports a given document or application into an OSTree bundle with verbose output. The `--ostree-verbose` flag increases the level of detail in the output generated during the export process, helping users to better understand what is happening at each stage of the operation.'
        transient: '[AI] `flatpak document-export` is a command-line utility for Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. The `--transient` option modifies its behavior to export the state of currently running applications as transient bundles. In other words, it creates temporary bundles that can be shared or saved for later use, preserving their current configurations and open files, without affecting the original application installations. These transient bundles can then be installed elsewhere, allowing others to reproduce the exact environment you had when creating them.'
        unique: '[AI] The `flatpak document-export --unique` command is used in Flatpak, a software deployment platform, to export metadata about installed applications into unique and human-readable JSON files. The `--unique` option ensures that each output file contains the metadata for only one application, avoiding conflicts if multiple identical applications are installed.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak document-export` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output given during the execution of this command. When used with `document-export`, it exports the metadata and configuration data of a Flatpak application into a human-readable format (JSON), displaying detailed information such as installed branches, dependencies, and their versions in real time.'
