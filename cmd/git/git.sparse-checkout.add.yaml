description: Add all files under SOME/DIR/ECTORY/ (at any depth) to the sparse checkout
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git sparse-checkout add` is a Git command used to add specific paths or directories to a sparse checkout. A sparse checkout allows you to have an incomplete working directory, which means not all files under a repository need to be checked out and stored locally. By using this command, you can selectively include the desired paths or directories within your local Git working directory.'
