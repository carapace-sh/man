documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `helm get` command is a part of Helm, the popular package manager for Kubernetes. The `manifest` sub-command retrieves the Kubernetes manifest file(s) for a specific release or chart. It fetches the latest version of the desired release from the given chart repository and returns the associated manifest files that define the desired resources and their configurations. This command helps in obtaining and inspecting the underlying Kubernetes definitions without installing or upgrading the application using Helm.'
    flag:
        revision: '[AI] `helm get manifest --revision` is a Helm command used to retrieve the Kubernetes manifest for a specific revision of a released chart. The `--revision` option specifies the desired revision number, and the command returns the exact state of the deployed resources at that point in time. This can be useful when you want to apply a specific configuration or compare differences between different versions of your application.'
