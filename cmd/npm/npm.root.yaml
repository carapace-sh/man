    command: '[AI] The `npm root` command is used to determine the folder in the current file system that contains a package.json file, which is the configuration file for Node.js projects managed by npm (Node Package Manager). It returns the absolute path to this directory, helping users navigate between multiple npm installations or projects with different package.json files within their file system.'

        global: '[AI] The `npm root --global` command is used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). It returns the file path of the global npm installation directory.
