documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl log-target` is a command used in Linux systems with systemd initialization to view the logs of specific targets or units. The logs can be viewed in real time or can be saved to files. The syntax is as follows: `systemctl --user --level-filter=<severity> log <target>`, where `<target>` refers to a specific target or unit, and `--level-filter` specifies the minimum severity level of the logs to be displayed or saved. By default, all logs are shown when no target is specified. The output can be sent to a terminal window or redirected to a file for later analysis.'
