    command: '[AI] The `glab issue board` command is used with GitLab''s CLI tool (GitLab CLI or glab for short) to display and interact with the issues on a specific GitLab project''s board in a terminal. It helps users manage their issues more efficiently by allowing them to view, create, update, label, assign, and close issues directly from the command line without using a web browser. This can be particularly useful for developers working on large projects or those frequently switching between different repositories or terminals.'
