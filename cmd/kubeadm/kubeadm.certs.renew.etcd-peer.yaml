description: Renew the certificate for etcd nodes to communicate with each other
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save the certificates
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubeconfig=: The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster. If the flag is not set, a set of standard locations can be searched for an existing kubeconfig file.

    command: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew etcd-peer` is a command used to renew the SSL certificates for an etcd peer node in a Kubernetes cluster managed by kubeadm. The etcd peer nodes are responsible for storing and managing the cluster''s configuration data and membership information, requiring secure communication between them. The command updates the expiring or already expired certificates ensuring secure and uninterrupted etcd communications within the cluster.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: |-
            [AI] The command `kubeadm certs renew etcd-peer --cert-dir` is used to renew the TLS certificates for an Etcd peer node in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm.

            Kubeadm is a tool for deploying a production-ready Kubernetes cluster, and it sets up the initial certification authorities (CAs) and server certificates during installation. However, these certificates have a limited validity period, and they must be renewed before they expire to ensure secure communication between cluster components.

            The `renew` subcommand of the `kubeadm certs` tool is used to automate the certificate renewal process. In this specific command, we are renewing the certificates for an Etcd peer node, and specifying the directory `--cert-dir` where the new certificates will be stored after they have been generated.

            After executing this command, you will find the updated TLS certificates in the specified directory that can be used to secure the communication between the Etcd peers in your cluster.
        config: |-
            [AI] The `kubeadm certs renew etcd-peer --config` command is used to renew the SSL certificates for an Etcd peer node in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. This command should be run on the machine where Kubeadm is installed and configured.

            The `--config` option specifies the path to the Kubeadm configuration file, which contains the necessary information to manage the cluster and its components. The `renew etcd-peer` argument instructs Kubeadm to renew only the certificates for the Etcd peer nodes in the cluster.

            In summary, this command is used to maintain the security of a Kubernetes cluster by keeping the SSL certificates up-to-date and ensuring secure communication between Etcd peer nodes.
        kubeconfig: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm certs renew etcd-peer` is a command used to renew the SSL certificates for an Etcd peer node in a Kubernetes cluster managed by `kubeadm`. The `--kubeconfig` flag specifies the location of the kubeconfig file, which contains the configuration information for the `kubeadm` tool and access to the cluster.

            This command is important because the SSL certificates used by Etcd have a limited lifespan. Once they expire, Etcd will no longer accept connections from the Kubernetes control plane, causing issues with cluster communication. By renewing these certificates using `kubeadm`, you can ensure that your cluster remains operational and secure.
