    command: |-
        [AI] The `brew postgresql-upgrade-database` command is used to upgrade an existing PostgreSQL database using Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command automatically performs several tasks:

        1. It stops the running PostgreSQL server.
        2. It initializes a new cluster with the same name and configuration as the old one.
        3. It upgrades the database files in the new cluster using the pg_upgrade utility.
        4. It starts the new PostgreSQL server with the upgraded database.
        5. It updates the symlink to the PostgreSQL binary, so that it points to the newly upgraded version.

        This command makes it easy to perform a major version upgrade of PostgreSQL while minimizing downtime and ensuring data integrity.
    flag:
        debug: |-
            [AI] The `brew postgresql-upgrade-database --debug` command is used to upgrade a PostgreSQL database using Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--debug` flag enables debug mode during the upgrade process, which provides more detailed output and can help identify any issues that may occur during the upgrade.

            The `postgresql-upgrade-database` tool is a utility provided by Homebrew to perform in-place upgrades of PostgreSQL databases without downtime. It performs a series of steps to prepare the old database for upgrade, creates a new database with the target major version, and then rewrites the data from the old database into the new one.

            In summary, `brew postgresql-upgrade-database --debug` is used to perform an upgrading operation on a PostgreSQL database using Homebrew while providing detailed debugging information during the process.
        help: |-
            [AI] The `brew postgresql-upgrade-database --help` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux, to upgrade a PostgreSQL database using the `postgresql-upgrade-database` utility. This command displays help information about how to use this utility effectively. Here's a brief explanation of its components:

            1. `brew`: Homebrew Package Manager
            2. `postgresql-upgrade-database`: A utility provided by Homebrew for upgrading PostgreSQL databases without data loss.
            3. `--help`: An option that displays detailed help information about the command's usage, arguments, and options.
        quiet: |-
            [AI] The command `brew postgresql-upgrade-database --quiet` is used to upgrade a PostgreSQL database in macOS, using Homebrew package manager. The `postgresql-upgrade-database` utility automates the process of taking a backup of an existing database, dropping it, creating a new one with the same name and configuration, and then restoring the data from the backup.

            The `--quiet` flag suppresses informational messages during the upgrade process. This is useful for running the command in scripts or automated workflows where detailed output may not be necessary.

            In summary, this command upgrades a PostgreSQL database silently using Homebrew and the built-in PostgreSQL upgrade utility.
        verbose: '[AI] The `brew postgresql-upgrade-database` command is used to upgrade a PostgreSQL database using Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output displayed during the upgrade process, providing more details about what the command is doing at each step.
