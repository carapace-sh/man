    command: '[AI] `npm set-script` is a command used in Node.js projects to configure and manage scripts within the `package.json` file using npm (Node Package Manager). It allows users to add, edit or delete script shortcids and their corresponding commands or tasks. For instance, `npm set-script start "node server.js"` sets a new script named ''start'' that runs ''node server.js'' when invoked using the command line with ''npm start''.'
    flag:
        workspace: '[AI] `npm set-script` is a command used in Node.js projects managed with npm (Node Package Manager). It allows defining custom scripts to be run using the `scripts` section in the `package.json` file. The `--workspace` flag is an optional argument for this command and is used when working with multiple packages in a single workspace, such as a monorepo or Lerna project. With `--workspace`, the script is defined at the root level of the workspace and applied to all the projects within it, making it easier to maintain consistent scripts across your project structure.'
        workspaces: '[AI] `npm set-script` is a command used in Node.js projects with multiple packages within one directory, managed by npm''s workspaces feature. This command allows you to define custom scripts for each package. By using the `--workspaces` flag, you specify that the script should be applied across all workspaces within the project, ensuring consistency and convenience when defining common tasks that apply to multiple packages.'
