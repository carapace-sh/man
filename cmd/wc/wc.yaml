documentation:
    command: '[AI] `wc` is a common Unix utility used to print the number of bytes, words, and lines in a given file or input stream. It stands for "word count." The basic syntax is: `wc [OPTION] ... [FILE]...`. Without any options, it displays the total number of bytes, words, and lines in each file specified. Additional options can be used to change this behavior, such as displaying only the number of lines or words, or merging multiple files into one output.'
    flag:
        bytes: '[AI] `wc --bytes` is a command in Unix-based operating systems used to print the number of bytes and the number of lines or words in each file given as an argument. The `--bytes` option specifies that only the byte count should be displayed for each file. For example, running `wc --bytes filename.txt` would output something like `254 filename.txt`, indicating there are 254 bytes in the file named "filename.txt".'
        chars: '[AI] `wc --chars` is a command in Unix-like operating systems, specifically the `wc` (short for "word count") utility. The `--chars` option instructs `wc` to count the total number of characters, excluding the newline character at the end of each line. So, when you run `wc --chars <file>`, it outputs the number of characters in the given file.'
        files0-from: '[AI] `wc --files0-from <filename>` is a command in Unix-like operating systems, specifically the `wc` (short for "word count") utility. This command option reads input from a given file named `<filename>`, instead of reading from standard input, and writes only the zero-terminated filenames to the output for each input file. The flag `--files0-from` instructs `wc` to behave this way. Essentially, it allows you to pass a list of files as arguments, and only prints those filenames on the output. This can be useful when you want to count the number of lines or other metrics for each file but also need the file names.'
        help: '[AI] `wc --help` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, to print the number of lines, words, and characters in each file or standard input provided as arguments. The `--help` option displays detailed usage information for this command, explaining various options and their functions. For instance, you can use `--lines`, `--words`, or `--characters` to output only the corresponding count, or combine multiple options like `--line-bytes` or `--files0-from`. The default behavior is to display all three counts for each file.'
        lines: '[AI] `wc --lines` is a command in Unix-based operating systems used to count the number of lines in one or more files. The ''wc'' stands for "word count" and the ''--lines'' option specifies that only the line count should be displayed. When you run this command followed by file names as arguments, it returns the number of lines in each file, usually separated by a newline character, making it easy to check the line counts of multiple files at once.'
        max-line-length: '[AI] `wc --max-line-length` is a command in Unix-based systems used to count lines, words, and bytes in files. The `--max-line-length` option specifically displays the maximum length of lines in each file. It outputs the filename followed by the number representing the maximum line length. This can be useful for identifying long lines in large files, facilitating text wrapping or formatting adjustments.'
        version: '[AI] `wc --version` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems to print the number of lines, words, and characters in files. The option `--version` is used to display the version information of the `wc` (short for "word count") utility itself. This includes the name of the program, its version number, and sometimes additional details such as the operating system it was built for.'
        words: '[AI] `wc --words` is a command in Unix-like operating systems, specifically part of the GNU Core Utilities. The `wc` (short for "word count") command is used to print the number of lines, words, and characters in a given input. When `--words` option is used, the command counts the number of words in each line and outputs the total number of words in all lines as well as an optional filename as arguments. For example, `wc --words file.txt` will output something like "20 50 150" where the first number represents the number of lines, the second number is the total number of words, and the third number represents the total number of characters (including spaces) in the input file `file.txt`.'
