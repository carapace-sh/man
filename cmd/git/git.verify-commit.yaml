description: Check the GPG signature of commits
group: interrogator
flags:
    --raw: print raw gpg status output
    -v, --verbose: print commit contents
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git verify-commit` is a Git command used to validate the authenticity of a specific commit object''s SHA-1 hash using a GPG key. It checks if the committer''s signed tag or signature matches with the given key. The command is typically used in environments where the integrity of commits needs to be ensured, such as in software development teams or organizations that use Git for version control. The command takes the commit SHA-1 hash as an argument and returns a success message if the verification is successful, or an error message otherwise.'
    flag:
        raw: '[AI] `git verify-commit --raw` is a Git command used to validate the authenticity of a specific commit''s SHA-1 hash against the signed and verified tags in the local repository or remote repositories. It doesn''t display any output by default, but only returns exit status: 0 if the commit is valid, and non-zero otherwise. This command is often used in scripts to automatically check for commit authenticity before performing other operations. The `--raw` option tells Git not to use any cached information or perform any automagic actions like resolving references.'
        verbose: '[AI] `git verify-commit` is a Git command used to validate the authenticity of a specific commit object. When run with the `--verbose` option, it provides detailed information about the validation process. This includes checking the GPG signatures associated with the commit and verifying their integrity against the public key of the signing author or committer. The output will display various details such as the author and committer names, email addresses, and the SHA-1 hashes of the signed data and signatures. If all checks pass, the command will confirm that the commit is valid.'
