documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea milestones delete` command is used in the Tuleap project management tool to delete a specific milestone from a given project. This command does not require any arguments, as the milestone to be deleted should be previously identified and specified when invoking the command. For instance, you can use the following syntax: `tea plan delete <milestone_name>`, where `<milestone_name>` is the name of the milestone you wish to remove. Keep in mind that deleting a milestone will also remove any associated tasks or sub-tasks, so ensure you have considered the potential impact before executing this command.'
    flag:
        login: '[AI] The command `tea milestones delete --login` is a Teaspoon CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to delete a specific milestone from a GitHub project managed with Teaspoon, a tool for managing and visualizing GitHub projects'' development status. The `--login` flag indicates that the user will authenticate with their GitHub account interactively using their browser, providing necessary permissions for Teaspoon to perform the deletion action.'
        output: '[AI] The `tea milestones delete --output` command is used in the Tectonic (Tea) Kubernetes distribution by Docker to delete specific milestones from a GitOps repository. This command does not display any output by default, but you can specify an output format using flags such as `json`, `table`, or `yaml`. By using this command with the appropriate context and milestone names, you can remove unwanted or outdated milestones from your GitOps workflow and keep your Kubernetes clusters up-to-date.'
        remote: |-
            [AI] The command `git fetch origin --prune` is often used instead of `tee milestones delete --remote`. Here's what each part means in the original command:

            - `git`: Invokes Git, a version control system for managing source code.
            - `fetch`: Fetches all the latest commits from a remote repository (origin).
            - `--prune`: Automatically deletes stale remote tracking branches that have been deleted upstream.
            - Instead of this, `tee milestones delete --remote` command is less commonly used and consists of:
              - `git`: Invokes Git.
              - `tee`: A command-line utility for reading from standard input (stdin), modifying the data in some way, and writing it to standard output (stdout) or files. It's not directly related to this command but is used here as a convenient wrapper.
              - `milestones delete`: Deletes milestones remotely (on the origin repository).
              - `--remote`: Specifies that the deletion should be performed on the remote branch instead of the local one.
        repo: '[AI] The `tea milestones delete --repo` command is a part of the Teapot tool, which is used to manage GitHub repositories. This specific command deletes all milestones from the specified repository. It''s helpful when you want to start fresh with your milestones or if you no longer need them for tracking issues and development in that particular repository.'
