    command: |-
        [AI] The `yarn npm info` command is not a valid command, as it combines two different package managers - Yarn and npm (Node Package Manager). Instead, you can use separate commands for each:

        1. To get detailed information about installed packages using Yarn, run `yarn info <package-name>`. Replace `<package-name>` with the actual name of the package you want to inspect.

        2. To retrieve information about a package installed in your npm registry or local project using the command line interface (CLI), use `npm ls <package-name>` or `npm list <package-name>`. This will display the exact version, dependencies, and other relevant information for that specific package.
    flag:
        fields: '[AI] The `yarn npm info` command is used to display information about a specific package installed in a Node.js project managed by Yarn. The `--fields` option allows you to filter and display only specific fields of the output, such as "name", "version", or "description". For example, `yarn npm info package-name --fields version` will show only the installed version number of the "package-name" package.'
        json: '[AI] `yarn npm info --json` is a command used in Node.js projects managed with Yarn package manager. This command retrieves metadata about a specific package listed in the project''s `package.json` file and outputs it in JSON format. It provides detailed information like name, version, description, dependencies, authors, etc., which can be useful for debugging or automating tasks related to the project''s dependencies.'
