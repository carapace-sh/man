    command: '[AI] The `docker system df` command is used to display the disk usage statistics of Docker images, containers, and the Docker daemon itself. It provides information on the total and used space for each type of object in the Docker system. This command helps users manage their Docker resources effectively by giving them a clear understanding of how much disk space is being consumed.'
    flag:
        format: '[AI] `docker system df` is a command used in Docker to display the disk usage of images, containers, and other components. The `--format` option allows customizing the output format. For example, `docker system df --format="table{{.Name .Size}}"` will display the output as a table with columns for Name and Size. Without `--format`, the command displays the output in JSON format by default.'

The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output, providing more details like creation timestamp and size breakdowns for each object.'
