documentation:
    command: '[AI] `xdotool` is a versatile tool for interacting with X11 windows using the command line. The `windowactivate` command is a sub-command of `xdotool`, which allows you to activate a specific window based on its title, ID or description. This can be useful when automating tasks or navigating between applications quickly. When you use `xdotool search --name <title> | windowactivate` or similar commands, the focused input will shift to that window, making it the active one.'
    flag:
        sync: '[AI] `xdotool windowactivate --sync` is a command from the xdotool toolkit in Linux and other Unix-like systems. It brings the focused window (or a specified window by ID or name) to the foreground, making it active and visible on the desktop. The `--sync` option ensures that the operation completes before the script continues executing. This command is often used in automated scripts for application interaction or window management.'
