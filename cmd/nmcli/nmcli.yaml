documentation:
    command: '[AI] `nmcli` is a powerful and feature-rich command-line tool for interacting with the NetworkManager service in Linux systems. It allows users to query, modify, and manage network connections, monitor network interfaces, and troubleshoot networking issues. With `nmcli`, you can perform tasks such as enabling or disabling Wi-Fi or Ethernet connections, configuring VPN profiles, checking connection statuses, and more. The command supports both interactive mode for quick queries and non-interactive mode for scripting purposes.'
    flag:
        ask: '[AI] `nmcli --ask` is a command-line utility for NetworkManager in Linux systems. It allows interactive user input for executing NetworkManager commands that require confirmation or input, such as connecting to a Wi-Fi network or VPN. The `--ask` option enables the interactive mode and waits for user input when needed.'
        colors: '[AI] `nmcli --colors` is a command-line option for NetworkManager''s nmcli utility. It enables or disables colored output in the tool, making it easier to distinguish different parts of the output, such as error messages, warnings, or informational texts. With `--colors auto`, nmcli will automatically detect your terminal capabilities and adjust colors accordingly. Alternatively, you can use `--colors always` for forced color output or `--no-colors` to disable it entirely.'
        escape: '[AI] `nmcli --escape` is a command-line utility tool for NetworkManager in Linux systems. The `--escape` option is used to escape special characters in output, making it safe for use in scripts and shell commands without altering the original data. This helps ensure proper parsing of NetworkManager output by other applications or scripts.'
        fields: '[AI] `nmcli --fields` is a command-line utility for NetworkManager in Linux systems. The option `--fields` allows specifying a comma-separated list of columns or properties to be displayed when querying network connections or devices. This can be useful for extracting specific information from the output and simplifying data processing. For instance, `nmcli device wifi rescan --fields name,ssid,frequency` would display only the SSID, name, and frequency columns for available Wi-Fi networks during a scan.'
        get-values: '[AI] `nmcli --get-values` is a command used in NetworkManager, a system service for managing network connections in Linux. This command retrieves the values of specified connection key-value pairs. The output is printed as a list where each line contains the name of the connection and its corresponding value. For example, `nmcli --get-values con-name my_connection ifname` would return the interface name associated with the network connection named "my\_connection".'
        help: '[AI] `nmcli --help` is a command-line utility for NetworkManager, a system service that manages network connections in Linux systems. This command displays help information about `nmcli`, which is used to configure and manage NetworkManager connections and devices. The help text provides an overview of the various subcommands and options available for using `nmcli` to connect to different types of networks (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, VPN, etc.) and monitor their status.'
        mode: |-
            [AI] `nmcli` is a command-line tool for NetworkManager, which is a system service in Linux for managing network connections. The option `--mode` is used with `nmcli dev`, which lists or manipulates network devices and their connection profiles.

            With the `--mode` option, you can specify the output format of the command. For example, `nmcli dev --mode column` will display each device's information in a single line, while `nmcli dev --mode table` will display the information in a tabular format. Other available modes include `json`, `monitored`, and `legacy`. The choice of mode depends on your preference for viewing and processing the output data.
        overview: '[AI] `nmcli --overview` is a command-line tool in NetworkManager for Linux systems to display network connection status and basic information. It provides a summary view of all available connections, including their current state (connected or disconnected), type (wired or wireless), and interfaces'' identifiers (e.g., eth0 or wifi-[ssid]). This command is useful for quickly checking the overall network connectivity status in a concise format.'
        pretty: '[AI] `nmcli` is a networking management command-line tool for the NetworkManager service in Linux systems. The option `--pretty` is used to format and display network connection information in a human-readable way, instead of the default raw output. It makes the output easier to understand and interpret by regular users without requiring extensive knowledge of networking configuration files or command syntax.'
        show-secrets: |-
            [AI] `nmcli --show-secrets` is a command used in NetworkManager, a popular network configuration and management utility for Linux systems. This command is employed to display network connection secrets, such as passwords or certificates, in an encrypted format that's hidden by default.

            When executed, it shows the list of network connections along with their associated secrets, but instead of revealing the actual data, it displays a series of X characters to represent the concealed information for enhanced security. This can be helpful when debugging or managing complex network configurations where access to sensitive data is required. However, it's important to note that only users with root privileges have access to this command to ensure the protection of the hidden data.
        terse: '[AI] `nmcli` is a network management command-line tool for Linux systems. The `--terse` option is used with various `nmcli` commands to display output in a minimal, compact format, showing only essential information. For instance, using `nmcli device wifi rescan --terse` will list discovered Wi-Fi networks with their SSIDs and signal strengths without any additional details like encryption types or MAC addresses. This can be useful for quickly scanning for available networks or managing network interfaces while keeping the output clutter-free.'
        version: '[AI] `nmcli --version` is a command used in Linux systems to display version information about the NetworkManager tool, which is a powerful and flexible networking management solution. The command is executed in a terminal or command-line interface, and it returns output that typically includes the version number of NetworkManager, as well as any additional relevant build information such as the compile date and commit hash. This information helps system administrators ensure they have the latest version of NetworkManager installed, and can verify compatibility with other software components.'
        wait: '[AI] `nmcli --wait` is a command-line utility for NetworkManager in Linux systems. The `--wait` option causes the command to block and wait for the completion of network management operations, such as connecting or disconnecting from a network. It''s commonly used with other nmcli commands like `con up <id>` or `con down <id>` when you want to ensure that the operation is completed before continuing with other tasks in your script or terminal session. This can be useful for automation and batch processing of network configurations.'
