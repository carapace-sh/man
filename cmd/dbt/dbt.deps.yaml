documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dbt deps` is a command in dbt (Data Build Tool), an open-source data transformation and orchestration tool, used to calculate and display the dependencies of a given dbt project model. It generates a report of all the models that directly or indirectly depend on the specified model, helping developers understand the impact of changes before making them.'
    flag:
        profile: |-
            [AI] `dbt dep --profile` is a command used in dbt (Data Build Tool), an open-source data transformation and orchestration tool. This command is for managing dependencies between projects or models in dbt.

            The `--profile` option specifies the profile to use when running this command. A profile is a configuration file that defines settings for connection strings, targets, and other project-specific details. By using a specific profile with `dbt dep`, you ensure that the correct dependencies are installed based on your project's unique requirements.
        project-dir: '[AI] `dbt deps --project-dir` is a command used in dbt (data build tool) to manage dependencies between projects. The `--project-dir` argument specifies the directory containing the dbt project file (`.dbt` or `dbt_projects.yml`) that defines the project and its dependencies. This command will resolve and install any necessary packages as defined in the project''s `dependencies.yml` file, ensuring that all required dependencies are available for running data transformations.'
        target: |-
            [AI] `dbt deps --target` is a command used in dbt (Data Build Tool), an open-source data transformation and orchestration tool. This specific command is used to manage dependencies between dbt models and artifacts.

            The `--target` option specifies the target output format for the dependency graph. By default, it displays the result in a tree format in the terminal. Other valid options include JSON or YAML formats, allowing you to save or further process the dependency information as data structures.
        vars: '[AI] `dbt deps --vars` is a command in dbt (Data Build Tool), an open-source data transformation toolkit. This command is used to resolve and install the dependencies of your dbt project, as well as set environment variables (passed via the `--vars` flag) for those dependencies. The output shows the installed packages along with their versions. By setting variables, you can customize the behavior of your data pipelines based on specific environments or configurations.'
