    command: '[AI] `gh ruleset` is a GitHubActions command used to create, update, or delete custom workflow rules in GitHub. It allows users to define and manage conditions under which workflows are executed based on event types, branches, schedules, etc. The syntax for the command is: `gh ruleset [create|update|delete] <rule-name> <json-rule>`. For example, `gh ruleset create my_rule ''{"events":[{"types":["push"]}]}''` creates a new rule named "my\_rule" that listens for push events.'
