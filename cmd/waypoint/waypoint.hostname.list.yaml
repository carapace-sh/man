    command: '[AI] The "waypoint hostname list" command is used in Hashicorp''s Nomad cluster management system. This command returns a list of all registered hostnames (or nodes) in the Nomad cluster, providing their respective agent ID and status (online or offline). It helps cluster administrators to keep track of the active nodes in their infrastructure.'

        app: '[AI] The `waypoint hostname list --app` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint, a multi-cloud application delivery platform. This command lists out the hostnames or Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) of running instances for a specific application. By providing the `--app` flag followed by the name or ID of an application, Waypoint returns the associated hostnames that are currently available to access the app in your cloud environment.'
        plain: '[AI] The `waypoint hostname list --plain` command is used in HashiCorp''s Nomad and Consul tools. It retrieves a plain text list of the registered hostnames for all nodes in the cluster or service registry, respectively. This can be useful for scripting or manual configuration tasks. The `--plain` flag ensures that the output is simple and unformatted, making it easier to parse and use in other scripts or tools.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint hostname list --project` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool to list out the hostnames of all resources defined within a specific project. Waypoint organizes infrastructure as "projects" and manages each project''s resources separately. This command helps in identifying the configured hosts for a particular project, providing their respective hostnames for easy reference.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint hostname list --workspace` command is used with Waypoint, a tool from Hashicorp that simplifies managing and deploying applications across multiple environments. This command lists the hostnames of resources in a specific Waypoint workspace. The flag `--workspace` specifies the name or ID of the desired workspace.'
