description: Leave the swarm
flags:
    -f, --force: Force this node to leave the swarm, ignoring warnings
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker swarm leave` command is used to remove a node from a Docker Swarm cluster. When executed on a worker node, it instructs the node to stop registering with the Swarm manager and to unregister itself from the Swarm. This results in the worker node no longer being part of the cluster. The `leave` command does not affect the services running on the node; they continue to operate as normal, but without the benefits of Swarm clustering such as automatic replication and scaling.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `docker swarm leave --force` is a command used to forcibly remove a node from a Docker Swarm cluster. When you run this command, the worker node will be disconnected from the Swarm manager and all running tasks will be killed and their containers removed. This can be useful in cases where a node needs to be taken offline immediately, despite any running containers. The `--force` flag is used to bypass any warnings or errors that might occur during the removal process.'
