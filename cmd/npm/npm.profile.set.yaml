documentation:
    command: '[AI] `npm profile set` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). It allows users to configure global npm settings, such as email address or default registry, by setting key-value pairs in the `~/.npmrc` file in the home directory. For example, `npm profile set username myemail@example.com` sets the "username" property for authenticated operations. This command can help maintain consistent configuration across multiple projects and machines.'
