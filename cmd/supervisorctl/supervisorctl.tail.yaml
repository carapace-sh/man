    command: '[AI] `supervisorctl tail` is a command used in Supervisor, a process monitoring system. It shows the real-time log output of the specified process or all processes. The logs include start and stop events as well as any stdout or stderr messages generated by the processes. The tail command allows following the log output as it is being generated. For example, `supervisorctl tail my_program` would display the logs for the process named "my\_program".'

            [AI] `supervisorctl` is a utility used to control the Supervisor process, which is a popular system service manager for Linux and Unix-based systems. The command `supervisorctl tail -f <filename>` tells Supervisor to display the real-time log output of a specific process whose log file is `<filename>`.

            The `tail` subcommand is used to follow or view the end of a file, while the `-f` option makes it continuously display new data as it's being written to the file. By combining this with `supervisorctl`, we can monitor the logs of a specific process in real time without having to manually refresh the terminal.
