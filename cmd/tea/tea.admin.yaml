    command: '[AI] The `tea admin` command is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It seems to be specific to certain software applications or tools, particularly those related to TeaDB (Tea''s Advanced Database), an open-source SQL database management system. When used in the context of TeaDB, this command is likely to grant administrative privileges to the user executing it, allowing them to perform various tasks such as creating databases, managing users, and modifying configuration settings. Always ensure you have proper authorization before using such commands to avoid potential security risks.'
