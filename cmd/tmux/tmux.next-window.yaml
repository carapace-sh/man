documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux` command `next-window` is used to switch to the next window in a `tmux` session. It allows users to easily navigate through multiple windows within the same terminal multiplexer instance, making it convenient for managing multiple tasks or projects in separate windows.'
    flag:
        a: '[AI] The command `tmux next-window -a` in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, is used to switch to the next window in the same pane or tab, moving focus to the leftmost pane within that window. The `-a` flag stands for "advance" or "wrap around," meaning that if you are at the last window in a tab or multiple tabs, this command will take you back to the first window instead of stopping at the end.'
        t: '[AI] The command `tmux next-window -t` in Tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) is used to switch to the next window within the same terminal session. The `-t` option specifies the target window, which by default is the next one in the order of creation. If there''s no next window, it will cycle back to the first window. This command helps users efficiently navigate through their Tmux sessions and manage multiple windows effectively.'
