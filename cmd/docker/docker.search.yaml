documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker search` is a command used to search for Docker images on registries like Docker Hub. You can specify your query as an image name or keyword, and it will return a list of matching images along with their tags and details from the repositories. It''s a useful tool for discovering available images before pulling them into your local system.'
    flag:
        filter: '[AI] `docker search --filter` is a command used in Docker to filter the results of a repository search based on specific criteria. The `--filter` option allows users to apply filters to the search query, such as filtering by name, tag, or description. For instance, `docker search --filter "name=my-image" my-registry` will return only the images named "my-image" in the specified registry. It is a powerful feature for finding specific Docker images more efficiently among the vast Docker Hub repository.'
        format: '[AI] `docker search --format` is a command used in Docker to customize the output format of a search query for Docker images on the Docker Hub registry or other indexes. The `--format` option allows you to specify a Go template to transform the raw output into a more readable and structured format based on your requirements. This can be useful when automating tasks, such as scripting image deployment, by filtering and formatting search results directly from the command line.'
        limit: '[AI] The `docker search --limit` command is used to search for Docker images on the Docker Hub registry. The `--limit` option sets the maximum number of results returned by the command. By default, it returns up to 25 results. For example, `docker search --limit 10 nodejs` will return only the first 10 search results for the "nodejs" tag when searching for Docker images on Docker Hub.'
        no-trunc: '[AI] `docker search --no-trunc` is a command used in Docker to search for images in the Docker Hub registry. The `--no-trunc` flag modifies the output of this command, ensuring that the entire name and description of each image are displayed in full length without getting truncated (or cut off) in the console. In other words, it provides a more detailed listing when searching for Docker images.'
