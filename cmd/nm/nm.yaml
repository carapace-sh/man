name: nm
description: Nm lists the symbols defined or used by an object file, archive, or executabl
flags:
    -n: an alias for -sort address (numeric)
    -size: print symbol size in decimal between address and type
    -sort=: sort output in the given order (default name)
    -type: print symbol type after name
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nm` command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems is used to list the symbols (functions, variables, etc.) that are defined in an object file or shared library. It can display the names, types, and locations of these symbols. By default, it shows only external symbols. It''s often used for debugging, reverse engineering, and understanding linker output.'
    flag:
        "n": '[AI] The `nm -n` command is a utility from the GNU Binutils package used in Linux and other Unix-like systems for listing the symbols and their corresponding memory addresses in an object file or shared library. The `-n` option stands for "numeric-only" and instructs the tool to print only the numerical symbol names, without any mnemonic abbreviations or additional information like type or binding. This can be useful when working with large files or when focusing on specific aspects of the symbol table.'
        size: '[AI] The `nm` command with the `-s` or `--size` option in Object File Format analysis tools like `nm` from GNU Binutils, displays the size of each section and the total size of an object file. For each section, it shows the section name, size in bytes, and number of symbols. The output can help assess memory usage and understand the internal structure of the object file.'
        sort: '[AI] `nm -s` is a command from the GNU `readelf` and `objdump` utilities, used to list the symbol table information from object files or executables. The `-s` option specifically sorts the output alphabetically by the symbol names. This helps in quickly locating symbols within large codebases.'
        type: '[AI] `nm -t` is a command-line option for the `nm` tool in Unix and Linux systems, which stands for "name mangling". The `-t` option tells `nm` to only print type information about symbols in an object file or library. It doesn''t display any offsets or section information. This can be helpful when debugging symbol table data.'
