        [AI] `git sparse-checkout` is a command used to configure and manage a sparse checkout in Git, which allows you to selectively include or exclude specific directories or files from your working directory or working tree.

        The `reapply` subcommand is used after performing a sparse checkout to update the tracked files with changes that have been applied to the index but not yet committed. It applies any new changes to the files that are currently being tracked in the sparse checkout, ensuring they remain in sync with the latest changes in your repository.

        In summary, `git sparse-checkout reapply` command is used to apply and update the selected (sparsely checked out) files in your working directory with the latest changes from the repository.
