        [AI] `circleci orb source` is a CircleCI command used to install or update CircleCI Orbs, which are reusable collections of CircleCI configurations and scripts. The command takes an argument specifying the Orb's repository URL or name from the CircleCI registry. For example:

        ```bash
        circleci config install docker
        # or
        circleci config install my_orb@my_org/my_orb
        ```

        This command is typically executed in a `.circleci/config.yml` file or in a custom CircleCI script, enabling the usage of predefined configurations and functionalities provided by the Orb within your project's CircleCI workflows.
