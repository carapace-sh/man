documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command is a utility in Nix package manager that computes cryptographic hashes of files or output streams. The `to-base16` option specifies that the hash output should be in base-16 format, also known as hexadecimal format. Therefore, running `nix hash --to-base16 <file>` generates a hexadecimal hash sum for the given file.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command is a utility in Nix package manager for generating cryptographic hashes of files or outputs of other commands. The specific option `--to-base16` asks it to output the hash as a hexadecimal string instead of its default binary format. The `--debug` flag is used for enabling debug mode, which can provide more detailed information about the hashing process. In summary, this command generates a hexadecimal representation of a file or command output''s hash in debug mode.'
        log-format: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command is a utility in NixOS that computes cryptographic hashes of files or directories. The option `--to-base16` specifies that the output should be displayed in hexadecimal format, base 16. The option `--log-format` determines how the output is logged, which can be set to "short" or "long". With "short" format, only the hash value is printed, while with "long" format, a more detailed output that includes the hash algorithm and file size is displayed. So, the command `nix-hash --to-base16 --log-format short <filename>` will print only the hexadecimal hash of the file, whereas `nix-hash --to-base16 --log-format long <filename>` will display both the hash value and other additional information.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command is a utility from Nix package manager used to compute and display hashes of files or builds. The specific option `--to-base16` asks for the output to be in base-16 (hexadecimal) format, while `--print-build-logs` instructs it to print the build logs along with the computed hash. So, this command will output both the hexadecimal hash and the build log of a Nix expression or build result.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command is a utility from Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. The `--to-base16` option specifies that the output should be in base-16 hexadecimal format. The `--quiet` option suppresses any non-error messages during execution, resulting in only printing the hash value itself. Therefore, `nix-hash <file> --to-base16 --quiet` will print the base-16 hash of the given file without additional output.'
        type: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command is a utility in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This command computes cryptographic hashes of files or outputs. The option `--to-base16` specifies that the output should be displayed in hexadecimal format (base 16), while `--type` indicates the type of hash algorithm to use, such as SHA256, SHA3, or others. Together, these options generate and display a base16 representation of the specified hash.'
        verbose: '[AI] The command `nix-hash` is a utility from Nix packaging system used to compute cryptographic hashes of files or directories. The option `--to-base16` specifies that the output should be in hexadecimal format (Base16). The option `--verbose` instructs the command to print additional information, such as the name of the algorithm used for hashing and the size of the hash output. Therefore, this command computes a cryptographic hash of the input data in hexadecimal format and prints detailed information about the process.'
