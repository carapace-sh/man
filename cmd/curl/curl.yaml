documentation:
    command: '[AI] `curl` is a powerful and versatile command-line tool used for transferring data between or among different sites on the web. It supports various protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, and others. With `curl`, you can perform various operations like downloading files, uploading data, sending HTTP requests with custom headers, following redirections, and more. Its syntax is simple and flexible, making it a popular choice for automating web tasks or quickly fetching online content from the terminal.'
    flag:
        abstract-unix-socket: '[AI] The `--abstract-unix-socket` option in cURL is used to specify an abstract Unix domain socket as the location for cURL to connect instead of a traditional file path socket. An abstract socket does not require a specific file on the filesystem and instead is identified by its unique number assigned at creation time. This can be useful when communicating with daemons or services that create such sockets dynamically, as cURL can connect using the socket descriptor number rather than having to know the exact location of the socket file.'
        alt-svc: |-
            [AI] `--alt-svc` is a command-line option for the `curl` utility, which is used to transfer data between a client and a server using various communication protocols.

            With `--alt-svc`, curl supports the ALTSVC (Alternative Service) feature of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. ALTSVC allows clients to discover and use additional services for a given domain name, such as SSL/TLS encryption or WebSockets, by examining the `ALTSVC` header in an HTTP response. The `--alt-svc` option lets curl follow these alternative services when making requests.

            In summary, `--alt-svc` is an option that enables curl to utilize alternative services (as specified in the `ALTSVC` header) for a given domain during a request. This can be useful when connecting to servers that support modern communication protocols and features like HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.
        anyauth: '[AI] `curl --anyauth` is a flag used with the `curl` command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server using various communication protocols. It enables the use of any authentication method supported by `curl`, including Basic, Digest, NTLM, OAuth1, or OAuth2. The flag takes two arguments: the type of authentication (e.g., "BASIC", "DIGEST") and the user credentials as a string in the format "<type> <realm>:<username>:<password>". For example, `curl --anyauth BASIC:user:pass @ URL` would use Basic Authentication with the provided username and password.'
        append: '[AI] The `--append` option in cURL is used when sending data to a server as part of an HTTP request. It appends data to an existing file at the specified URL and sends it as the request body. This means that the file data is added to any previously existing data, creating a single data block for transmission. This feature is often used when uploading large files in parts or updating resources incrementally.'
        basic: '[AI] `--basic` is an option used with the `curl` command in HTTP requests. It specifies that a simple Basic authentication will be sent as part of the request. The user name and password are provided as arguments to the `--user` option, for example: `--user ''username:password''`. This option is commonly used when interacting with protected APIs or websites.'
        cacert: '[AI] The `--cacert` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server, specifies a file containing the CA (Certificate Authority) certificates to be trusted during SSL/TLS communication. It allows users to customize the set of trusted CAs beyond the system defaults, ensuring secure connections only with servers whose certificates are issued by trusted CAs.'
        capath: '[AI] The `--cacert` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server, specifies a PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail) or Certificate Authority (CA) bundle file containing trusted X.509 certificates to use during SSL/TLS communication. CA certificates are used to verify the authenticity of the server''s certificate before establishing an encrypted connection. By default, `curl` trusts the system CA certificates, but using this option allows customizing the trusted CAs for specific use cases.'
        cert: '[AI] The `--cert` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server, specifies the SSL certificate to use for SSL/TLS secured connections. It takes a file path as an argument. When this option is used, `curl` will also automatically use the corresponding private key specified by the `--key` or `--private-key` option. This setup allows `curl` to authenticate with the server using client certificate authentication.'
        cert-status: |-
            [AI] `curl --cert-status` is a command-line option for the `curl` utility, which is used to transfer data between a client and a server using various protocols such as HTTP, FTP, etc.

            This option displays the current SSL certificate status of the remote peer being connected to during an SSL/TLS secured communication. It prints out the name of the certificate authority (CA) that issued the certificate, the certificate's validity period, and the fingerprints (MD5 and SHA1) of the certificate. This information can help ensure the authenticity and trustworthiness of the remote peer before proceeding with the data transfer.
        cert-type: '[AI] `--cert-type` is an option used with the `curl` command line tool in SSL/TLS certificate management. It specifies the format of the certificate file provided to `curl` using the `--cert` or `--key-file` options. Accepted values include "PEM" (Protocol Economic Mansions) and "DER" (Distinguished Encoding Rules). The default value is PEM.'
        ciphers: '[AI] The `--ciphers` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data, specifies which SSL/TLS cryptographic protocols and cipher suites to use during an encrypted communication. Cipher suites define the encryption algorithms used for data confidentiality, integrity, and key exchange. By setting `--ciphers` with a comma-separated list of desired cipher suite names, a user can prioritize security preferences or exclude known vulnerabilities in the SSL/TLS communication. For example, `--ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256` would prioritize the use of the most secure cipher suites available.'
        compressed: '[AI] The `--compressed` option in `curl` is used to automatically compress and decompress data during a transfer using various compression methods like gzip or deflate. This helps reduce the amount of data transferred over the network, saving bandwidth and potentially increasing transfer speed. It''s particularly useful when downloading large files from compressed sources like tarballs (`.tar.gz`) or zip files (`.zip`).'
        compressed-ssh: '[AI] The `--compressed` option in `curl` is used to enable or disable data compression during a transfer. When making an SSH connection using `curl` with the `--ssh` option, you can combine these options with `--compressed` to enable data compression on that specific transfer: `curl --compressed --ssh <SSH-URL>`. This can help reduce the amount of data transferred over the network and improve the overall performance and efficiency of your SSH session.'
        config: '[AI] The `--config` option in `curl` is used to specify a custom configuration file. This file contains various curl options and settings, allowing users to customize their curl experience without having to type out the same commands every time. The configuration file can be located locally or remotely, and can be loaded using the `--config` flag followed by the path to the file. For example: `curl --config /path/to/myconfigfile.conf`.'
        connect-timeout: '[AI] The `--connect-timeout` option in the `curl` command-line tool sets a time limit for establishing a connection to a server before giving up and reporting an error. It helps prevent curl from getting stuck during network problems or unresponsive servers. Once the specified timeout is reached, curl will terminate the connection attempt. The default value is typically 30 seconds, but it can be adjusted with this option.'
        connect-to: '[AI] The `--connect-to` option in `curl`, a popular command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server, is used to explicitly specify the domain name or IP address of the primary host that the request should be directed towards. This can be particularly useful when making requests to a load balancer or a service with multiple endpoints, allowing you to bypass the load balancer or directly connect to a specific endpoint. By doing so, you may influence which instance of a cluster or service your request is processed on, potentially affecting the response time, data consistency, or other characteristics of the request-response interaction.'
        continue-at: '[AI] The `--continue-at` option in `curl` is used to resume interrupted file downloads from a specified byte offset. When this option is provided along with the `-O` or `-s -o` flags, `curl` will begin the transfer at the given offset instead of starting from the beginning if the local file already exists. This can save time when large files are being downloaded and the transfer is interrupted, as the download can be resumed from where it left off without having to start over from the beginning. The byte offset is specified in decimal notation followed by the `--` delimiter (e.g., `--continue-at -10M` for a 10MB offset).'
        cookie: '[AI] `curl` is a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server using various protocols, including HTTP and HTTPS. The `--cookie` option in `curl` allows you to set or use cookies for Authentication and state maintenance across multiple requests. Cookies are small text files that store session information, which can include things like user authentication tokens and preferences. By using this flag with a file containing cookie data, or by specifying key=value pairs directly, you can control the cookies `curl` sends in its requests, enabling persistent sessions across multiple requests to the same server.'
        cookie-jar: '[AI] `curl` is a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server using various protocols, including HTTP and HTTPS. The `--cookie-jar` option in `curl` is used to save session cookies into a file for future use. This flag allows `curl` to remember and send cookies back to the server with subsequent requests, which is useful when dealing with websites that require login sessions or other stateful interactions. By default, `--cookie-jar` saves cookies in a file named `cookies.txt`. You can specify a different file by providing a custom file path.'
        create-dirs: '[AI] The `--create-dirs` option in `curl` is used to create all necessary parent directories for specified remote file paths during a file transfer operation. It helps ensure that files are saved in the correct local directory structure when downloading multiple files with different directories in their paths.'
        crlf: '[AI] The `--crlf` option in `curl` is used to transfer data between a Git repository and a remote server, specifically for line ending conversion. It ensures that text files are transferred with LF (Unix) line endings on both the local and remote systems, even if the remote system uses CRLF (Windows) line endings. This option helps maintain consistency in line endings during file transfers between different operating systems.'
        crlfile: |-
            [AI] The `--curl-options` or `--config` option in `curl` is used to specify custom CURL options for a command. The `--crlfile` option is a part of this, specifically related to the handling of Certificate Authority (CA) certificates.

            When using `--crlfile`, you provide a file path containing one or more CA Revocation Lists (CRLs). These lists are used by CURL to verify the revoked status of certain SSL certificates presented during an HTTPS connection. By default, CURL looks for these files in system directories and environment variables, but `--crlfile` allows you to explicitly specify your custom CA certificates or CRLs.
        data: '[AI] The `--data` option in CURL is used to send data along with an HTTP request. It can be used for various purposes such as submitting a form, creating or updating resources on the server, etc. The argument for this option should be in the format of "KEY=VALUE" pairs separated by ampersands (&). For example: `--data "key1=value1&key2=value2"`. It also supports sending files by using the "@filename" syntax with the data part.'
        data-ascii: '[AI] The `--data-ascii` option in `curl` is used to send data as plain ASCII text to an HTTP server with a POST request. This data is passed in the body of the request, and each line of data should end with a CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed) character sequence to denote the end of a line. This option is useful when sending simple data like application/x-www-form-urlencoded or text/plain content types.'
        data-binary: '[AI] The `--data-binary` option in cURL is used to send raw binary data as the request body. This option tells cURL to treat the following data as a binary file instead of text data. The binary data can be provided using various methods such as reading from a file using the `@filename` syntax or piping data from another command. When this option is used, the `Content-Type` header is automatically set to `application/octet-stream`.'
        data-raw: |-
            [AI] `curl --data-raw` is a command-line option used with the `curl` utility in the context of making HTTP requests. The `--data-raw` option instructs `curl` to send raw data directly as the body of an HTTP request, without encoding it or treating it as a file. This can be useful when dealing with binary data or non-standard formats where encoding may not be appropriate. For example:

            ```bash
            $ curl -X POST --data-raw 'binary_data' http://example.com/api
            ```

            In this command, the `--data-raw 'binary_data'` argument sends a raw data string called `binary_data` as the body of an HTTP POST request to the specified URL (`http://example.com/api`).
        data-urlencode: '[AI] `curl --data-urlencoded` is a command-line option for the `curl` utility, used in making HTTP requests. It''s used to send form data as application/x-www-form-urlencoded content type in the body of the request. The `--data-urlencoded` option follows the `--data` flag and is followed by key=value pairs separated by an ampersand (&). Each pair is URL encoded before being sent, ensuring that any special characters are properly escaped for transmission. This encoding scheme is commonly used when submitting data to web servers through forms or APIs.'
        delegation: '[AI] `curl --delegation` is a feature in cURL, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, which enables the client to delegate authentication to an HTTP proxy server. With this option, cURL sends the necessary authentication credentials (like username and password) to the proxy server and lets it handle the authentication process before forwarding the request to the destination server. This can be useful in setups where the application or user doesn''t have direct access to the destination server but can communicate with an authenticated proxy server. The main advantage is that it simplifies the management of complex authentication schemes, particularly in corporate environments.'
        digest: '[AI] The `--digest` option in `curl` is used for transferring and verifying data using the Digest Access Authentication method over HTTP or HTTPS. This authentication scheme protects the password with a hash function, allowing only the server to verify the client''s transmitted hash against the stored value to grant access. The `--digest` flag tells curl to use this authentication method and provides the user credentials (username and password) in the format: `--digest USER:PASS`.'
        disable: '[AI] The `--disable` option is not a valid flag for `curl`, which is a command-line tool used for transferring data between or integrating with servers and services using various protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and SSH. This misconception might arise from confusion with other command-line utilities that have similar naming conventions. In reality, the `curl` command does not have a `--disable` flag.'
        disable-eprt: |-
            [AI] The `--disable-epsv` or `--disable-eprt` option in cURL is used to disable the use of EPSV (Extended Port Selection) or EPRT (Extended PORT) protocols during FTP transfers. These protocols allow the client and server to negotiate available ports for data transfer, which can be useful in certain network environments where specific ports are blocked or limited.

            By disabling these protocols with `--disable-epsv` or `--disable-eprt`, cURL will only use well-known FTP control (21) and data transfer (20) ports for the entire session, which may simplify configuration in certain scenarios or bypass restrictions that block the negotiation of non-standard ports. However, this may also limit flexibility and potentially prevent cURL from connecting to some FTP servers that rely on EPSV/EPRT for port selection.
        disable-epsv: '[AI] The `--disable-epsv` option in cURL is used to disable the use of Explicit ALTERNATE PORT (EASY-PROXY) protocol when connecting to a proxy server. With this option enabled, cURL will only use the standard HTTP or HTTPS protocol for communication with the proxy server, rather than attempting to use the EPSV or SOCKS protocols. This can be useful in situations where the proxy does not support these advanced protocols or where you want to avoid potential security issues associated with their use.'
        disallow-username-in-url: '[AI] The `--disallow-username-in-url` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a server and a client, disables sending usernames as part of URLs during an HTTP or FTP transfer. This is done to enhance security by preventing the transmission of usernames via URLs, thus reducing the risk of unintended exposure in logs or other publicly accessible records.'
        dns-interface: '[AI] The `--dns-interface` option in cURL is used to specify the network interface on which cURL should send DNS queries for resolving domain names. By default, cURL uses the operating system''s default DNS resolver. However, this option allows users to choose a different network interface, such as when using multiple network interfaces or when working in containerized environments. This can be helpful in situations where you want to use a specific DNS server or resolve domain names through a particular network interface for security or performance reasons.'
        dns-ipv4-addr: '[AI] The `--dns-ipv4-addr` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server, is used to specify a specific IPv4 address to be used for DNS resolution. With this flag, the user can override the default DNS resolver and manually provide an IPv4 address to resolve domain names. This can be useful in cases where the default DNS resolver may not provide accurate results or when testing network configurations.'
        dns-ipv6-addr: '[AI] The `--dns-ipv6-addr` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data, is used to enable IPv6 addresses resolution when making DNS queries. By default, curl uses both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in its DNS resolver. However, if you want to force the use of IPv6 addresses only, you can use this option. It helps in testing or troubleshooting applications that primarily support IPv6 or if you simply want to prioritize IPv6 connections.'
        dns-servers: '[AI] The `--dns-servers` option in cURL is used to specify custom DNS servers to be used for resolving domain names during a cURL transfer. It takes one or more IP addresses or hostnames as arguments, and cURL will use these servers instead of the default system DNS settings. This can be useful for bypassing local DNS caching or using specific DNS servers for testing or troubleshooting purposes.'
        doh-url: |-
            [AI] The `--dump-header` (`-H`) option in `curl` is used to include custom headers in HTTP requests. The `--url` (`-L`) option follows a location header and performs an HTTP request on the new URL.

            The combination of both, `--dump-header --url`, is used when you want to send custom headers with an HTTP request and follow any Location header that might be returned in the response, printing the headers for each request and response along the way. The `--doh` (`--data-or-text`) option is used to specify data or text to be sent as part of the request body, but it's not relevant to this specific use case.
        dump-header: '[AI] The `--dump-header` option in `curl` is used to send custom headers along with an HTTP request. It allows you to specify one or more key-value pairs that will be included in the request header. For example, `--dump-header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"` sets the value of the "Authorization" header to a given token. This option is useful when making requests requiring authentication or setting custom headers as per server requirements.'
        egd-file: '[AI] The `--egd-file` option in the `curl` command line tool is used to specify a file containing entropy for use with the /dev/urandom or /dev/random devices, which are accessed via the `--rand` (or `--silent-and-verbose`) flag. This is useful when running curl in an environment where the system''s random number generator may not have enough entropy, such as in a containerized or virtualized environment. The file should contain sufficient random data to ensure good statistical properties for generating random numbers.'
        engine: '[AI] The `--engine` option in cURL is used to specify which libcurl backend engine to use for making network requests. It allows users to choose between different engines like libcurl, libssh2_curl, or libzlibcurl, each with its unique features and capabilities. Changing the engine can affect performance, security, or compatibility depending on the specific use case.'
        etag-compare: '[AI] `curl --etag-compare` is a feature in cURL, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server using various protocols, including HTTP. This option compares the Entity Tag (ETag) headers of two requests. The ETag is a unique identifier assigned by the server to the version of a resource it returns, allowing clients to determine if they have a current copy or not. With `--etag-compare`, cURL can compare the ETags returned with two requests and report whether they match or not, helping to ensure that clients are using the most up-to-date version of a resource.'
        etag-save: '[AI] The `--etag-save` option in `curl` is used to save the Entity Tag (ETag) header value received during an HTTP response to a file. An ETag is a unique identifier for a specific version of a resource and is used for cache validation and update checks. By saving the ETag value, you can compare it with the next response''s ETag to determine if the content has changed and decide whether to download a new copy or use the cached one. This option is particularly useful when using caching strategies in HTTP transfers.'
        expect100-timeout: '[AI] `curl --expect100-timeout` is an option used with the command-line tool `curl` to set a timeout for receiving a HTTP 100 Continue status from the server during a transfer. This can be useful when making large file transfers or performing complex requests where it''s important to ensure that the server does not take too long to respond, otherwise known as "stalled transfer". The option sets the timeout in seconds (e.g., `--expect100-timeout 30` sets a timeout of 30 seconds). If the server fails to respond within this timeframe, `curl` will terminate the transfer.'
        fail: '[AI] The `--fail` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, instructs it to terminate with a non-zero exit code if the response received from the server has a non-2xx (success) status code or an error occurred during the transfer. This allows scripts using curl to fail immediately when faced with network errors, server down situations, or invalid responses.'
        fail-early: '[AI] The `--fail-early` option in cURL is used to immediately stop and report an error as soon as a transfer error occurs, without attempting to finish the current request or even sending the whole command if it''s a problem with the initial setup (like invalid URL syntax). This can help diagnose issues more effectively by providing early feedback on potential problems.'
        false-start: '[AI] The `--false-start` option in cURL is used to disable the False Start feature. False Start is a feature that sends the first few chunks of a large transfer (HTTP or FTP) before waiting for the response from the server to confirm the connection and start the data transfer. This can improve performance by reducing the time spent waiting for the connection confirmation, but it also carries the risk of retransmitting data if the connection is not established properly. Disabling this feature with `--false-start` ensures that cURL will wait for a proper connection before starting the data transfer.'
        form: |-
            [AI] The `--form` option in `curl` is used for making HTTP requests with form data. It allows sending key-value pairs as part of the request body, just like a standard HTML form submission. For example:

            ```bash
            curl --form "name=John" --form "age=30" --form file=@/path/to/file.txt http://example.com
            ```

            This command sends an HTTP POST request to `http://example.com`, with three form fields: "name" set to "John", "age" set to "30", and a file named "file.txt" at "/path/to/file.txt" attached as form data.
        form-string: |-
            [AI] The `--form-string` option in `curl` is used to send HTTP requests with application/x-www-form-urlencoded data. It allows sending key-value pairs as part of the request body by passing a name=value argument, which will be encoded and sent automatically. For example:

            ```bash
            curl --form-string "param1=value1" -X POST <URL>
            ```

            This command sends an HTTP POST request to `<URL>` with the key 'param1' and value 'value1'. Multiple parameters can be sent by separating them with a space, like:

            ```bash
            curl --form-string "param1=value1 param2=value2" -X POST <URL>
            ```
        ftp-account: |-
            [AI] The `--ftp-account` option in Curl is used to specify an FTP username and password in a single line, separated by a colon (:``) when making an FTP transfer. This option simplifies the command line for making anonymous or authenticated FTP requests without having to provide separate `-u` flags for the username and password. The syntax is:

            ```bash
            curl --ftp-account <username:password> [<FTP URL>]
            ```
        ftp-alternative-to-user: '[AI] The `--ftp-alternative-to-USER` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data, is used to specify an alternative username for FTP (File Transfer Protocol) transfers when the standard one is not applicable. It overrides the default user name provided with the `-u` or `--user` option. This can be useful in cases where multiple users share the same account and need to access it with different usernames.'
        ftp-create-dirs: '[AI] The `--ftp-create-dirs` option in cURL is used when making FTP transfers. It instructs cURL to create remote directories that do not currently exist, automatically, as needed during file transfer operations. In other words, it enables the creation of necessary parent and child directories on the FTP server, ensuring that the file''s destination path is correctly set up.'
        ftp-method: |-
            [AI] `--ftp-method` is an option in the `curl` command-line tool used for transferring data with the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) protocol. This option allows specifying which FTP method to use for uploads:

            * `--ftp-method RETRIEVE` (default): Use Normal Upload (STOR) and Download (RETR) methods.
            * `--ftp-method UPLOAD`: Use Passive Mode Active Upload (PASV STOR). The server opens a new data connection for uploads, which can be useful in case the default active FTP mode is blocked by a firewall.

            Additionally, there are other methods like `AUTO` and `ACTIVE`, but they are less common:

            * `--ftp-method AUTO`: Let curl decide which method to use based on the FTP server's response. This is usually the recommended option, as it adapts to the server configuration.
            * `--ftp-method ACTIVE`: Use Active Mode for both uploads (PORT STOR) and downloads (PORT RETR). In this mode, the client opens a new data connection for each transfer, which can also be required by some FTP servers. However, it's less common than Passive Mode due to potential security concerns.
        ftp-pasv: '[AI] The `--ftp-pasv` option in the `curl` command line tool is used to enable Passive FTP mode during an FTP transfer. In this mode, instead of the FTP server assigning a fixed port number for data connection, it listens on a well-known port (by default, 20) and waits for the client to connect back with a randomly chosen port number. This is useful when the client is behind a NAT or firewall that restricts outbound traffic from specific ports, as it allows the FTP transfer to still take place without requiring configuration changes on the client side.'
        ftp-port: '[AI] The `--ftp-port` option in `curl` is used to specify an alternative data port number other than the default FTP port 21 for the FTP transfer. By providing this option followed by a port number, curl initiates the FTP connection to the given host and port combination (host:port), with the data connection established on the specified non-default port instead of the standard port 20. This can be useful when dealing with firewalls or proxies that block default ports, or when using FTP servers that require non-standard configurations.'
        ftp-pret: |-
            [AI] The `--ftp-pref` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data, is used to specify FTP (File Transfer Protocol) custom request prefixes. It allows users to customize the command that is sent before the FTP commands (like `RETR`, `STOR`, etc.) when using FTP with `curl`. For instance, if you need to include a specific query or header in your FTP requests, you can use this option to set it. The syntax is:

            `--ftp-pref "CustomCommand: [FTP Command]"`

            For example:

            `curl --ftp-pret "QUOTE SYST:;" --ftp-upload "file.txt" ftp.example.com/path/to/destination`

            In the above command, before executing any FTP commands, `curl` will send `QUOTE SYST:` to the FTP server. This option can help in specific use cases where additional customization of FTP requests is required.
        ftp-skip-pasv-ip: '[AI] The `--ftp-skip-pasv-ip` option in `curl` is used when making FTP transfers over an IPv6 network, where the passive mode data connection requires a different IP address than the one used for the control connection. With this flag set, `curl` will not attempt to negotiate the IP address for the passive FTP transfer and instead use the same IP address as the control connection. This can be useful in certain network configurations where IP addressing is managed dynamically or restricted.'
        ftp-ssl-ccc: |-
            [AI] `curl` is a command-line tool for transferring data between or within servers using various protocols, including FTP (File Transfer Protocol). The option `--ftp-ssl-ccc` is specific to FTP transfers over SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security).

            This option enables three security features for the FTP transfer:

            1. Implicit FTPS (FTP Secure) or FTPES (FTP Explicit): It establishes an encrypted control connection using SSL/TLS, ensuring data privacy during the command exchange between the client and server.
            2. Automatic CA certificate handling: `curl` will automatically check the certificate presented by the FTP server against known trusted CAs (Certificate Authorities). If no matching CA is found, the transfer may be aborted for security reasons.
            3. Use of local CA certificates: The client can provide its own custom CA certificates to trust specific servers with invalid or self-signed certificates. These certificates are specified using the `--capath` and `--cacert` options.
        ftp-ssl-ccc-mode: '[AI] The `--ftp-ssl-ccc-mode` option in `curl` is used to enable CCC (Compressed Control Channel) mode during FTP transfers over SSL/TLS. CCC allows for data compression on the control channel of an FTP session, which can lead to improved transfer speeds and reduced network traffic. This option ensures that curl uses this feature when connecting to an SSL/FTP server.'
        ftp-ssl-control: '[AI] The `--ftp-ssl-control` option in Curl is used to enable Secure FTP (SFTP) or FTPS transfer mode with SSL/TLS encryption for data and control channels. It ensures that both the data and control connections between the client (Curl) and server are encrypted during the file transfer process, providing enhanced security.'
        get: '[AI] `curl --get` is a command used in cURL, a powerful and versatile command-line tool for transferring data between or within different types of computers and servers. This specific option `--get` instructs cURL to send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL, meaning it requests to retrieve data from the server without sending any additional data. The response received is then printed to the standard output (stdout) by default.'
        globoff: '[AI] The `--globoff` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data, disables filename globbing in URLs. Globbing is a feature that allows expanding wildcard characters in a URL before sending the request to the server. With `--globoff`, curl treats any special characters in the URL literally and sends them as they are, without expansion. This can be useful when dealing with literal filenames or paths containing special characters.'
        happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms: '[AI] The `--happily-wait` flag with the `--hide-progress-bar` option and the `--max-time` sub-option in curl (a command-line tool for transferring data) sets a timeout for DNS pre-resolution during HTTPS/SSL handshakes. Specifically, `--happily-wait` enables the "Happy Eyballs" algorithm that allows curl to attempt an IP address resolution simultaneously with the SSL handshake, but if no response is received within the specified time (set by `--max-time` or its default value), curl will abort and raise an error. The flag name `--happily-wait` refers to the fact that the connection attempt is made "happily," assuming that a response will be returned in due course, but if not, the operation is terminated after a reasonable wait.'
        haproxy-protocol: '[AI] The `--haproxy-protocol` option in `curl` is used to configure `curl` to communicate with an HTTP(S) load balancer, specifically one implemented using HAProxy. This option enables the use of HAProxy''s SSL handshake offloading and proxy protocol features. By sending the PROXY protocol headers, `curl` can provide metadata about the client request and server response to the load balancer, allowing it to track and report detailed statistics, perform traffic shaping, and implement other advanced functionality.'
        head: '[AI] `curl --head` is a command in `curl`, a popular command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server, used to request only the response headers from an HTTP or FTP server without downloading the actual content. It''s often used to check metadata like the Content-Type, size, or Last-Modified header of a file before deciding whether to download it.'
        header: |-
            [AI] `curl --header` is a command-line option used with the curl tool to send custom headers in HTTP requests. The headers modify the request's metadata, such as authorization tokens, content type, or user agent string. You can specify multiple headers using key-value pairs, separated by colons and multiple headers by semicolons. For example:

            ```bash
            curl --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" --header "Content-Type: application/json" https://example.com
            ```
        help: '[AI] `curl --help` is a command used in the cURL utility to display comprehensive help information about the application. This includes details on various options and their usage, supported protocols, syntax for different types of requests, and more. It''s an essential command for users looking to learn about the capabilities of cURL or needing a quick reference while using it.'
        hostpubmd5: '[AI] The `--host-pubmd5` option in cURL is used to verify the MD5 checksum of the public key of an HTTPS server during SSL/TLS certificate verification. It helps ensure the authenticity and integrity of the connection by comparing the received public key with a known, expected value. If they match, the connection can be considered secure. This option enhances security by allowing users to independently obtain the MD5 checksums from trusted sources before connecting to a server.'
        http0.9: '[AI] The `--http0.9` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data, is used to enable HTTP/0.9 mode. This is an obsolete and simplified version of the HTTP protocol that only supports GET requests without headers and does not include status codes or response body. Instead, the server responds with plain text containing the requested resource. It was designed for very simple file transfer over static resources without the need for complex interactions between client and server. Since modern web development heavily relies on dynamic content, HTTP/0.9 is rarely used in practice.'
        http1.0: '[AI] The `--http1.0` option in curl is used to force the HTTP client to use HTTP/1.0 instead of the default HTTP/1.1 protocol for communication with the server. HTTP/1.0 is an older version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which has less advanced features compared to its successor. This option may be necessary when interacting with older servers or systems that do not support HTTP/1.1 fully.'
        http1.1: '[AI] The `--http1.1` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data, specifies that HTTP version 1.1 should be used for communication between the client and server during the transfer. This option improves performance by allowing features like persistent connections, pipeline transfers, and chunked transfer encoding.'
        http2: '[AI] The `--http2` flag in `curl` is used to enable HTTP/2 as the transport protocol when making a request with `curl`. HTTP/2 is a newer version of HTTP, the protocol used for communication between web clients and servers. It offers several advantages over its predecessor, including multiplexing multiple requests over a single connection, header compression, and improved security. By using `--http2`, `curl` will establish an HTTP/2 connection with the server instead of HTTP/1.1.'
        http2-prior-knowledge: '[AI] The `--http2` flag in `curl` is used to enable HTTP/2 support for the transfer of data between a client and server. The option `--http2-prior-knowledge` is a feature within this flag that allows `curl` to initiate an HTTP/2 connection with a server even if the server doesn''t explicitly signal its support in the initial handshake. This can save time by avoiding additional round trips to determine HTTP/2 capability.'
        http3: '[AI] The `--http3` option in `curl` is used to enable HTTP/3 support in the transfer. HTTP/3 is the latest major version of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is a data format used for transmitting, manipulating and retrieving data on the World Wide Web. Compared to its predecessor, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 introduces several improvements such as using binary protocol over QUIC transport instead of TCP, which enables multiplexed streams and header compression. By enabling this option in `curl`, you can take advantage of these features when communicating with HTTP/3-enabled servers.'
        ignore-content-length: '[AI] The `--ignore-content-length` option in `curl`, a popular command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, instructs curl to ignore any Content-Length header that might be present in the response from the server. This can be useful when dealing with certain types of servers or responses where the Content-Length header may not accurately represent the actual size of the data being transferred. By ignoring this header, `curl` will continue transferring the entire response until it reaches a complete end-of-file marker (EOF).'
        include: '[AI] The `--include` option in `curl` is used to follow HTTP redirections and include the content of the redirected pages in the response. It automatically follows location headers issued by an HTTP server during an `HTTP GET` request and includes the content of the finally returned page in the output. This can be useful when you want to retrieve the final URL that a server may redirect to, along with its content.'
        insecure: '[AI] The `--insecure` flag in cURL is used to ignore SSL certificate verification during a transfer. This means that cURL will not check the authenticity of the SSL certificate presented by the server, and will proceed with the data transfer regardless. This can be useful for accessing servers with self-signed or incorrect certificates, but it also carries increased security risks as the connection may be intercepted or manipulated by an attacker. It is generally recommended to only use this flag in trusted environments.'
        interface: '[AI] The `--interface` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, specifies the network interface or socket to use for the transfer. It can be used to force curl to send or receive data through a particular network adapter or endpoint, such as a specific IP address, port number, or Unix domain socket path. This option is useful when working with multiple interfaces, VPN connections, or when dealing with firewall restrictions.'
        ipv4: '[AI] The `--ipv4` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, is used to force IPv4 protocol resolution when making requests. It ensures that DNS queries return only IPv4 addresses instead of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. This can be useful in environments where IPv4 addressing is required or preferred.'
        ipv6: '[AI] The `--ipv6` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between or integrating with servers, enables IPv6 support in the client. It allows curl to establish connections using IPv6 addresses instead of IPv4. In other words, it instructs curl to prioritize IPv6 addresses when resolving DNS queries and establishing connections. This can be useful when trying to access IPv6-only servers or services.'
        junk-session-cookies: '[AI] The `--junk-session-cookies` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, instructs curl to ignore and discard any session cookies it receives during the transfer. This can be useful when testing APIs or making requests without the need to maintain state across multiple requests. It does not save or send any cookies to the server in the request headers.'
        keepalive-time: '[AI] The `--keepalive-time` option in `curl` is used to set the time interval for sending keepalive requests to maintain an idle TCP connection. It helps prevent the connection from being closed due to inactivity, allowing data transfer to resume more quickly when new requests are made. The unit of time can be specified with a suffix such as "s" (seconds) or "m" (minutes).'
        key: '[AI] The `--key` option in `curl` is used to specify a private key file for SSL/TLS certificates when making secure HTTPS requests. This option ensures that curl uses the specified key file for client certificate authentication during the request, if needed. It enhances the security of the transfer by adding an additional layer of authentication.'
        key-type: '[AI] `curl --key-type` is an option used with OpenSSL certificates in cURL, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server over various protocols. This option specifies the type of key file being used, which can be either private (`--key-type pkcs12`, `--key-type pem`) or passphrase-protected PEM (`--key-type pem-pass`. When using SSL/TLS certificates with cURL, both a certificate and a corresponding private key are typically required. Setting the correct key type helps ensure proper handling of the files during the transfer process.'
        krb: '[AI] The `--krb` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data, is used to enable Kerberos authentication. Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that provides strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. With the `--krb` option, curl can send and receive encrypted data packets to authenticate with a Kerberos realm and make HTTP requests while ensuring secure communication between the client and server.'
        libcurl: '[AI] `curl --libcurl` is not a flag for the `curl` command itself, but rather a way to use the libcurl library, which is the underlying URL transfer library used by curl. By linking against libcurl instead of invoking curl directly, you can leverage its functionality in your own applications. This provides more control over the transfer process and can be useful for customizing features such as SSL/TLS handling or proxy settings.'
        limit-rate: |-
            [AI] The `--limit-rate` option in `curl` is used to set a download or upload speed limit for the transfer. This can be useful when you want to control the bandwidth usage of a particular transfer, or when you have a slow connection and want to ensure that other network traffic isn't affected.

            The option takes two values: the transfer rate in bytes per second (e.g., `--limit-rate 10M` for 10 megabytes per second), and an optional modifier indicating the direction of the transfer (`--upload-limit-rate` or `--download-limit-rate`, with the default being download). For example, to limit the upload speed to 5 megabits per second:
            ```
            curl --upload-limit-rate 5M <file_to_upload>
            ```
        list-only: '[AI] The `--list-only` option in `curl` is used to output only the headers of an HTTP response, in a key-value format that can be easily parsed by shell scripts or other tools. It suppresses the response body and displays only the headers'' names and values, separated by a colon, on the terminal.'
        local-port: '[AI] The `--local-port` option in cURL is used to specify a local port number for cURL to bind and listen on for incoming connections, when performing a client-side proxy operation or during certain kinds of transfers like FTP uploads. This allows the data being sent to be first routed through the local cURL instance before being forwarded to its final destination. It is important to note that using this option may require additional configuration on the network level, such as setting up port forwarding rules on routers or firewalls, depending on the specific use case and environment.'
        location: '[AI] The `--location` flag in cURL is used to follow redirections and set the method to GET or POST accordingly based on the HTTP response status code. In other words, it means that the request will be a simple request where the response from the server is the final response to the client, without any further redirections. This flag automatically sets the `-C` or `--continue-at` option to off (meaning from the beginning of the file), but you can override this behavior by using both flags together.'
        location-trusted: '[AI] The `--location-trusted` flag in cURL is used to bypass certificate verification when making an HTTPS request. This means that cURL will trust any SSL certificate presented by the server without performing any checks. This flag is typically used when you trust the server and its certificate unequivocally, such as in local development or testing environments where self-signed certificates are common. It''s important to note that using this flag can pose a security risk if the server''s certificate has been tampered with or is not trusted by your system, as it could potentially allow man-in-the-middle attacks.'
        login-options: |-
            [AI] `--login-options` is an option used with the `curl` command in Linux or Unix environments for transferring data between a client and a server using various protocols. This option is specifically designed to handle basic authentication, allowing the user to automatically provide a username and password when making requests to servers that require login credentials. It simplifies the process of interacting with such servers and can save time and effort by avoiding manual entry of the login details each time a request is made. The exact format for specifying the login options varies depending on the server setup, but typically involves appending `--user` followed by the username and password in plain text or base64 encoded format:

            ```bash
            curl --login-options "--user myusername:mypassword" https://example.com/api
            ```

            Or using a `.netrc` file, which stores usernames and passwords for various servers:

            ```bash
            curl --login-options "~/.netrc" https://example.com/api
            ```
        mail-auth: '[AI] The `--mail-auth` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, is used to enable SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) authentication during an HTTP or HTTPS request with an attached email message. This is typically used when making API requests to send emails using a specific email account. The user provides the authentication details (username and password) along with the command, ensuring secure transmission via SSL/TLS encryption.'
        mail-from: '[AI] The `--mail-from` option in `curl` is used to specify the email address from which messages are sent when using the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) feature of curl for sending emails. This option helps in setting up the sender''s email address during an SMTP transfer, allowing you to send emails using curl with a valid and recognized sender address.'
        mail-rcpt: '[AI] The `--mail-rcpt` option in `curl` is used to specify one or more email addresses as recipients for an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) request. When using this option, `curl` sends the data following the `--data` or `-d` option as the message body, and sets the header fields based on any provided with the `--header` option. This can be useful for sending automated emails or making API requests that require email notifications.'
        mail-rcpt-allowfails: '[AI] The `--mail-rcpt-allow-failures` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, allows specifying that failure to deliver email messages (using the `-T` option for transferring files via FTP or SFTP) should not cause an error. Instead, `curl` will continue with further commands or requests in the script or command line. This flag is particularly useful when automating tasks involving multiple file transfers and emails where occasional delivery failures are expected but should not halt the overall process.'
        manual: '[AI] `curl --manual` is a command used in the curl data transfer utility to display its built-in manual page or user guide. This option can be invoked by providing `--manual` as an argument, followed by either the topic or the section number of the manual you wish to view. For instance, `curl --manual ''libcurl''` will show the library-specific documentation, while `curl --manual VS16` displays version-specific information for Visual Studio users. Overall, it offers a quick and efficient way to access comprehensive curl documentation directly from the terminal.'
        max-filesize: '[AI] The `--max-filesize` option in `curl` is used to set a limit on the size of files that can be transferred during an HTTP or FTP transfer. It takes the size as an argument, followed by the unit (e.g., "10M" for 10 megabytes). If the file size exceeds this limit, `curl` will terminate the transfer with an error message. This option helps prevent large file transfers that may consume excessive resources or time when not desired.'
        max-redirs: '[AI] `--max-redirs` is a command-line option for the cURL utility, which sets a limit on the maximum number of redirects that cURL will follow when making a request. By default, cURL follows up to 20 redirections. Setting this option allows you to specify a different limit or disable redirections entirely by setting it to zero. This can be useful when dealing with potentially problematic redirection chains, as excessive redirects may indicate issues with the server or resource being requested.'
        max-time: '[AI] The `--max-time` option in `curl` is used to set a maximum time limit for an operation. If a command takes longer than the specified time (in seconds) to complete, `curl` will interrupt it and print an error message. This can be helpful when making network requests or running other commands where long execution times may indicate issues with the connection or the command itself.'
        metalink: |-
            [AI] The `--meta-local` and `--meta` flags in cURL are used for handling MetaLink data in HTTP responses. MetaLink is a mechanism for providing metadata about resources that can be used to locate other related resources. When a response contains MetaLink headers, cURL can be instructed to follow these links using the `--meta-local` or `--meta` flags.

            The `--meta-local` flag follows only local MetaLink links, i.e., those with the `<link>` tag's `<rel="metadata">` attribute set to "self". The `--meta` flag follows both local and remote MetaLink links.

            These flags help automate the process of retrieving related resources, such as alternate formats or documentation, that may not be directly linked in the initial request.
        negotiate: '[AI] The `--negotiate` option in `curl`, a popular command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, is used to enable Basic and Digest authentication using the Negotiate protocol, which is part of the Windows Integrated Authentication system. In this context, `curl` acts as a client in a client-server scenario where both parties support Negotiate. The flag allows `curl` to automatically handle the authentication process by sending an initial request without any credentials and then negotiating with the server for the most appropriate method (Basic, Digest, or Negotiate) based on the response from the server. This can simplify the use of secure authentication in various applications.'
        netrc: '[AI] `curl --netrc` is a command-line option used with the curl data transfer tool. The `--netrc` option enables curl to use the `~/.netrc` file for authentication information, following the NetRFC (NetRC File Format) standard. This file stores login credentials for various FTP and other remote servers, allowing users to automate authentication during curl sessions without having to enter them manually every time.'
        netrc-file: '[AI] `curl --netrc-file` is an option used with the `curl` command in the context of handling authentication data for FTP, FTPS, and HTTPS URLs. The `--netrc-file` argument specifies a file containing the authentication credentials to use when making requests. This file, usually named `.netrc`, is typically located in the user''s home directory or can be specified with an explicit path. When this option is used, curl reads the credentials from the given file and includes them in the request, enabling automatic login for supported protocols.'
        netrc-optional: '[AI] The `--netrc-optional` flag in curl is an optional argument for the NetRC file handling. It means that the use of the NetRC file for handling authentication data is disabled by default, but can be enabled on a per-operation basis by passing the NetRC file path to curl using the `--netrc` option. In other words, it allows fine-grained control over when to use the NetRC file for authentication, while keeping the default behavior as not using it.'
        next: '[AI] The `--next` option is not a valid flag for the `curl` command in its standard usage. It seems to be misspelled or non-existent. The correct usage of `curl` flags can be found by running `curl --help`.'
        no-alpn: '[AI] The `--no-alpn` option in cURL is used to disable Automated Length Preface Negotiation (ALPN) during TLS handshake. ALPN is a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension that allows clients and servers to negotiate the preferred version of their chosen application protocol over an encrypted connection. Disabling ALPN with `--no-alpn` can be useful when communicating with older servers or when there''s a need for compatibility with specific protocol versions. In summary, this option in cURL restricts the TLS handshake to SSLv3, TLSv1, and TLSv1.2 protocols without ALPN negotiation.'
        no-buffer: '[AI] The `--no-buffer` option in cURL is used to disable the buffer feature, which allows reading and writing data from/to a local file during the transfer instead of keeping it in memory. This can be useful when dealing with large files or limited memory environments. By disabling this option, cURL will read and write data directly from/to the network without buffering it, potentially improving performance in certain scenarios.'
        no-keepalive: '[AI] The `--no-keepalive` option in cURL is used to disable the HTTP keep-alive feature. Keep-alive is a method that allows multiple requests to be sent over the same TCP connection without closing and reopening it after each request, improving performance for subsequent transfers on the same connection. However, some servers may not implement keep-alive correctly or may have it disabled. In such cases, disabling keep-alive in cURL using `--no-keepalive` can help avoid issues with hung connections or failed requests.'
        no-npn: '[AI] The `--no-npn` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server, disables the use of the Next Protocol Negotiation (NPN) feature. NPN is a TLS extension that allows clients to indicate multiple protocols they support during the handshake process. By disabling this option, curl will only request or offer a single protocol to negotiate with the server. This can be useful in certain situations where specific protocol versions need to be enforced or when dealing with legacy servers.'
        no-progress-meter: '[AI] The `--no-progress-meter` option is a command-line argument used with the `curl` utility in the context of transferring data between a client and a server over the Internet. This option disables the progress meter displayed during the data transfer, which provides real-time information about the download or upload rate and the estimated time remaining. Using this flag can be useful when you don''t need to monitor the transfer''s progress visually or prefer to keep the terminal output clean without displaying the progress bar.'
        no-sessionid: '[AI] The `--no-session` or `--no-cookie` option when using `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, disables the use of cookies in that specific request. It means that no cookies will be sent to the server with the request, and no cookies will be received from the server in the response. This option can be used when you want to ensure that the request does not contain any previously stored session information.'
        noproxy: '[AI] The `--noproxy` option in `curl` is used to disable the use of a proxy server. When this option is set, all requests made by curl will be sent directly to the remote servers without passing through any proxy servers. This can be useful when you want to bypass a proxy or when you know that the target server can be reached directly.'
        ntlm: '[AI] The `--ntlm` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data, is used to enable Negotiate (NTLM), a proprietary Microsoft authentication protocol for Windows systems. This flag allows `curl` to send NTLM requests and responses during an HTTP or HTTPS interaction when the server requires authentication using this method. It''s essential in corporate environments where single sign-on (SSO) is implemented on Windows-based networks.'
        ntlm-wb: '[AI] `curl` is a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server over various protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and others. The option `--ntlm-wb` enables Negotiate with NTLM (NT LAN Manager) authentication in Windows domains for HTTP basic, digest, or NTLM authentication challenges. This flag is used when the server requires authentication that `curl` doesn''t support directly and you need to provide your own credentials. With `--ntlm-wb`, you can also save and reuse a username/password pair using the `--ntlm-auth-file` option.'
        oauth2-bearer: '[AI] The `--oauth2-bearer` option in CURL is used to make authenticated HTTP requests using an access token as a bearer token. It accepts an access token as an argument and sets the `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer <access_token>`. This allows making API calls to services that require OAuth2 Bearer token authentication, such as GitHub or Google Cloud Platform.'
        output: '[AI] The `--output` option in cURL is used to write the output of an HTTP request to a specific file instead of printing it on the standard output (terminal). The file path is specified as an argument to this option, for example: `curl --output output.txt https://example.com`. This will save the response from the URL into a file named "output.txt" in the current directory.'
        output-dir: '[AI] The `--output-dir` option in Curl is used to specify a directory as the output destination for multiple downloads. When this option is used, Curl will save files in the specified directory instead of using their original filenames. This can be useful when downloading multiple files with similar naming conventions. The files will be saved with their original filenames but located in the specified directory.'
        parallel: '[AI] `curl --parallel` is a feature in GNU `curl` that allows multiple transfers to be performed concurrently. It automatically splits large data downloads into smaller chunks and sends these chunks as separate requests to take advantage of potential parallelism. This can significantly reduce the overall time required for downloading multiple files or large data sets from the same server. To use it, simply pass the `--parallel` option followed by a number to specify the maximum number of concurrent transfers (default is 4). For example: `curl --parallel 5 <URL>`. This would initiate up to five simultaneous downloads.'
        parallel-immediate: |-
            [AI] `curl --parallel-immediate` is a command-line option used with the `curl` utility in a Unix environment for downloading multiple files from the same URL or different URLs in parallel, with immediate data output as soon as each part of the download is available.

            The `--parallel` flag enables parallel downloads, while `--immediate` ensures that output is displayed immediately after receiving it instead of waiting for the entire download to complete for each file. This results in faster transfer speeds and reduced overall download time when dealing with multiple files.
        parallel-max: '[AI] `curl --parallel-max` is a feature in the `curl` command-line tool that allows running up to a specified number of download or upload tasks in parallel. The option `--parallel`, followed by an integer number with `--parallel-max`, sets the maximum limit for concurrent transfers. For instance, `--parallel 4 --parallel-max 4` would initiate four transfers at once and wait for all to complete before starting new ones. This can improve transfer speeds, especially in large file handling or multiple downloads/uploads scenarios.'
        pass: '[AI] `--pass` is an option used in cURL, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server. This option is used to specify that the password or other authentication data should be passed interactively when a server challenges for authentication during an FTP or SFTP transfer. It does not store or echo the input for security reasons, making it suitable for protecting sensitive information.'
        path-as-is: '[AI] The `--path-as-is` option in cURL is used to send a request with the given path exactly as it appears, without interpreting any tilde (~) or other special characters in the URL. This can be useful when making requests to remote servers with specific file paths that include such characters. With `--path-as-is`, cURL will send the request with the original path unaltered.'
        pinnedpubkey: |-
            [AI] The `--pinned-pubkey` option in cURL is used to associate a specific public key with an SSL certificate during an SSL connection. This can be useful for verifying the authenticity of the server's certificate, especially when dealing with self-signed or trusted certificates that might not be recognized by the system's CA (Certificate Authority) store.

            The user provides the public key as a hexadecimal string, which is then compared against the public key extracted from the server's SSL certificate during the SSL handshake. If they match, the connection is considered secure and data exchange can proceed. This option strengthens security by allowing users to manually verify the authenticity of the certificates and not rely solely on the system's CA store for verification.
        post301: |-
            [AI] `curl --post301` is a command-line option used with the curl utility in Linux and other Unix-based systems for transferring data between a client and a server using various communication protocols such as HTTP or HTTPS.

            The `--post301` flag is specifically used to follow redirections (HTTP status codes 3xx) during an HTTP POST request, up to 301 (permanent redirect). When a server returns a redirection status code, curl will automatically send a new request to the specified location and continue with the data transfer. This option allows users to upload files or submit forms that may be handled by a redirections-based workflow on the server side.
        post302: '[AI] The `--post302` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data, is used to follow redirections with a status code of 3xx (including 302 - Found) up to a maximum of 302 times. This allows the user to make an HTTP POST request that may involve multiple redirections before reaching the final destination. If more than 302 redirections are encountered, `curl` will stop and report an error.'
        post303: '[AI] The `curl --post303` command is a usage of the cURL (Command-line tool for transferring data) utility to send an HTTP POST request with a custom header `Expect: 100-continue`. The `--post303` option is not a standard flag, it seems like it''s being used incorrectly or in combination with other flags. The correct way to use this option would be `curl --expect-continue '' Expect: 100-continue'' --post <URL> ...`, where the `<URL>` represents the target URL for the request. This command is often used when uploading large files, and the server requires the client to confirm that it has enough data before continuing with the request.'
        preproxy: '[AI] The `--preproxy` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data from or to a server, is used to configure curl to use a proxy server for all connections made during the execution of the curl command. This means that the data being transferred will first go through the specified proxy server before reaching its final destination. The option takes the address and port number of the proxy server as arguments, for example: `--preproxy <proxy_address>:<port>`. By default, this option disables SSL verification, meaning that curl will not check if the certificate presented by the proxy server is valid or not. This can be dangerous in some environments where certificate security is important, and it''s recommended to use `--insecure` instead if you want to disable certificate validation for specific servers only.'
        progress-bar: '[AI] `curl --progress-bar` is a command-line option for the `curl` utility, which is used to transfer data between a client and a server using various protocols. The `--progress-bar` flag enables a progress bar while downloading data from the server. It displays the percentage of completed data transfer in real time, providing visual feedback to the user on the download''s status. This can be helpful for monitoring long or large file transfers.'
        proto: '[AI] The `--proto` option in the `curl` command-line tool specifies the network protocol to use for the transfer. It can be set to values such as `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `FTP`, `SFTP`, or custom protocols using the `PROTOCOL:/...` format. For example, `--proto TCP:80` can be used for a custom TCP connection on port 80. This option allows users to explicitly choose the transport layer protocol and customize their transfer accordingly.'
        proto-default: '[AI] The `--proto-default` option in `curl` is used to set a default network protocol for all URLs specified on the command line or input files. It allows you to override the automatic protocol detection and force curl to use a specific protocol such as HTTPS, FTP, SCP, etc. For example, `--proto-default ''https''` will make all URLs be treated as HTTPS requests.'
        proto-redir: '[AI] The `--proto-redir` option in cURL is used to enable or disable the handling of HTTP Protocol Redirection (3xx class responses). When this option is set, cURL will automatically follow any redirects indicated by such responses and perform the request on the final URL. If `--no-protobuf` or no protocol redirection option is given, cURL will not follow any redirects and return an error instead.'
        proxy: '[AI] The `--proxy` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, is used to specify a proxy server to route the request through. This can be helpful in cases where network traffic is filtered or when trying to access resources that are only available via a proxy server. The syntax is `--proxy <host:port>`, with `<host>` being the address of the proxy server and `<port>` being its port number. For example, `curl --proxy 192.168.0.1:8080 https://example.com` would send all requests to `https://example.com` through the proxy located at `192.168.0.1:8080`.'
        proxy-anyauth: '[AI] `curl --proxy-anyauth` is a command-line option used with the curl utility in transporting data between your machine and a remote server. It enables the use of authenticated proxy servers with the NTLM, Negotiate, or Basic authentication methods. The flag is followed by the username and password for the proxy in the format `--proxy-anyauth <host:port> <username:password>`. This allows curl to automatically send the credentials during setup of the proxy connection.'
        proxy-basic: |-
            [AI] `curl` is a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server. The option `--proxy-basic` is used to configure `curl` to make requests through a proxy server using basic authentication.

            With this option, you can specify the address and port of your proxy server followed by the credentials (username and password) in the format `<user:pass>`. For example:

            ```bash
            curl --proxy-basic "username:password" <URL>
            ```

            This command tells `curl` to use the specified proxy server with basic authentication for accessing the given URL.
        proxy-cacert: '[AI] The `--proxy-cacert` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server, is used to specify a custom SSL certificate authority (CA) file for verifying the identity of the CA that issued the SSL certificate of the proxy server. This option enhances security by allowing you to trust specific CAs other than the default system ones. The given CA cert file must be in PEM format and should be located on the local filesystem.'
        proxy-capath: '[AI] The `--proxy-capath` option in cURL is used to specify a custom directory path for proxy certificate files. Proxy servers may require clients to present certificates to authenticate and establish secure connections. By providing this option, users can provide cURL with the location of their trusted proxy certificates, allowing it to make requests through those proxies while verifying their authenticity. This can be particularly useful when working in enterprise environments or accessing resources over restricted networks that require specific proxy configurations.'
        proxy-cert: '[AI] The `--proxy-cert` option in `curl` is used to specify a SSL certificate file for authenticating the client when making requests through a proxy server that requires SSL certification. This is useful when using `curl` to access resources over secure proxies, such as in corporate environments or when working with specific APIs. The file path to the certificate should be provided as an argument to the option.'
        proxy-cert-type: |-
            [AI] The `--proxy-cert-type` option in cURL is used to specify the type of SSL certificate that the proxy server will present during an HTTPS connection. The valid types are: PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail), CERT (raw certificate data), and DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules).

            For example, `--proxy-cert-type PEM` indicates that the proxy's SSL certificate is in PEM format, which is a common format for OpenSSL and many other SSL libraries. It's important to provide this information correctly, as cURL won't be able to proceed with the SSL handshake if the certificate type doesn't match what's expected.
        proxy-ciphers: |-
            [AI] `--proxy-ciphers` is an option used with the cURL command line tool to specify which SSL/TLS protocols and cipher suites should be used when connecting to a proxy server. This can help ensure secure and compatible communications between the client (running cURL) and the proxy.

            For example, `--proxy-ciphers "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:"` sets the ciphers to use in the order of preference. It includes ECDHE (Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman), RSA, AES encryption with GCM (Galois Counter Mode) and SHA256 or SHA384 hashes.

            Using this option helps maintain security by enforcing the use of strong cipher suites and SSL/TLS protocols when connecting to a proxy server.
        proxy-crlfile: '[AI] The `--proxy-crlfile` option in cURL is used to specify a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) file for cURL to check against when establishing a secure SSL/TLS connection using a proxy server. A CRL is a list of digital certificates that have been revoked by their issuer, and checking it can help prevent connections to compromised or invalid certificates. This option enhances the security of your cURL sessions when using a proxy server.'
        proxy-digest: '[AI] The `--proxy-digest` option in `curl` is used to enable Digest Access Authentication with a proxy server. In this authentication method, both the client and the proxy server compute and exchange MD5 digests of the request and response data. This ensures secure and confidential transfer of login information between the client and the proxy. When using `--proxy-digest`, you also need to provide the username and password with `--anyauth` or `--user` option, allowing curl to automatically handle the Digest authentication process.'
        proxy-header: '[AI] The `--proxy-header` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, is used to specify custom headers that will be sent with any requests made through an HTTP or SSL proxy. These headers may include things like authentication credentials (e.g., Proxy-Authorization) or other metadata that the target server requires. By providing this option, you can ensure that your requests conform to the requirements of the remote server while still using a proxy to handle the connection.'
        proxy-insecure: '[AI] The `--proxy-insecure` option in cURL is used to bypass SSL certificate verification during a proxy connection. This means that cURL will not check the authenticity of the SSL certificates presented by the proxy server, potentially allowing connections to servers with invalid or self-signed certificates. It''s important to note that using this option can introduce security risks and should be used with caution. Always ensure that the proxy server is trusted before using this option.'
        proxy-key: '[AI] The `--proxy-key` option in cURL is used to specify a file containing a private key for SSL certificates when making an HTTPS request through a proxy server. This option helps authenticate the client to the proxy server using the provided SSL certificate. The file should be in PEM format and must be readable by the user running the cURL command.'
        proxy-key-type: |-
            [AI] The `--proxy-key-type` option in cURL is used to specify the type of authentication key when making a request through a proxy server using the HTTP, SOCKS, or other supported protocols. The valid types are:

            * `basic`: Plain text username and password in base64 encoding, sent over an unsecured connection.
            * `digest`: Digest authentication which requires the client to provide a response that includes the hashed password.
            * `ntlm`: Negotiate (NTLM) authentication used for Windows domain authentication.
            * `oauth2`: OAuth2 bearer token for API access with proper authorization.

            Using this option, you can securely configure your cURL requests to connect through proxies that require specific types of authentication keys.
        proxy-negotiate: '[AI] The `--proxy-negotiate` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server, is used when the proxy server requires authentication before establishing a connection. With this flag, `curl` initiates a PROXY AUThentication (Negotiate) protocol to provide the necessary credentials if needed. This allows `curl` to interact with proxies that require NTLM or Kerberos authentication.'
        proxy-ntlm: '[AI] The `--proxy-ntlm` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server, is used to authenticate with an NTLM (NT LAN Manager) proxy server. NTLM is a proprietary authentication protocol developed by Microsoft, commonly used in Windows environments for handling authentication requests over HTTP or other protocols. The `--proxy-ntlm` option allows users to provide the proxy server''s username and password directly within the curl command line, ensuring that their requests are authenticated before being forwarded on to their final destination.'
        proxy-pass: '[AI] The `--proxy-pass` option in cURL is used when making requests through a proxy server. It specifies that the data following the option in the command line should be sent directly to the proxy, without being processed by cURL. This allows cURL to act as a simple proxy forwarder and pass the request data to the specified proxy server. The response from the proxy server is then returned to cURL for further processing and display. Essentially, `--proxy-pass` allows cURL to be used as an intermediary between a client and a proxy server when making HTTP or HTTPS requests.'
        proxy-pinnedpubkey: '[AI] `--proxy-pinnedpubkey` is an option used with the cURL command line tool for transferring data between a client and server using various communication protocols. This option allows users to specify a public key for verifying the authenticity of a proxy server''s SSL certificate. With this option, cURL will only trust connections that have a proxy certificate matching the provided public key. This helps ensure secure communications through the specified proxy server.'
        proxy-service-name: '[AI] The `--proxy-service-name` option in cURL is used when making requests through a proxy server that supports the Service Name Indication (SNI) extension. With this option, you can specify a custom name for the service being accessed via the proxy. This information is sent to the proxy along with the request, allowing it to selectively route the request based on the provided service name. It can be useful in certain enterprise environments where proxies are configured to only allow access to specific services or domains.'
        proxy-ssl-allow-beast: |-
            [AI] The `--proxy-ssl-allow-beast` option is a feature in the curl command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server using various protocols. This option disables SSL certificate verification when making an HTTPS request through a proxy server, overriding the default behavior of curl to verify the peer's certificate against a trusted CA.

            By allowing insecure SSL/TLS connections with this flag, curl can bypass issues arising from self-signed certificates or misconfigured certificates from the proxy server, making it possible to establish an encrypted connection even under potentially insecure circumstances. However, using this option comes with a significant security risk, as it allows for man-in-the-middle attacks and other forms of certificate tampering. It is recommended that this flag be used only when necessary and under trusted networks.
        proxy-tls13-ciphers: '[AI] The `--proxy-tls13-ciphers` option in curl is used to specify the TLS 1.3 cipher suites that should be used when making a secure (HTTPS) connection through a proxy server using SSL/TLS protocol. Cipher suites define the encryption algorithms and key exchange methods for securing data transmitted over SSL/TLS connections. By specifying `--proxy-tls13-ciphers`, you can ensure that only the most secure cipher suites are used when communicating with a proxy server, enhancing the security of your data transfer.'
        proxy-tlsauthtype: |-
            [AI] The `--proxy-tlsauthtype` option is a command-line argument used with the `curl` utility in the context of making HTTPS requests through a proxy server. This option specifies the TLS authentication type to be used when connecting to the proxy server.

            There are several TLS (Transport Layer Security) authentication types, but two common ones are "no-client-cert" and "client-cert". With no-client-cert, the client does not provide a certificate during the TLS handshake, while with client-cert, the client provides a certificate for authentication.

            When using `curl`, the `--proxy-tlsauthtype` option is used to set this authentication type when connecting to the proxy server:

            - `--proxy-tlsauthtype no-client-cert`: Instructs curl not to provide a client certificate during TLS handshake with the proxy server.
            - `--proxy-tlsauthtype client-cert`: Requires curl to present a client certificate during TLS handshake with the proxy server for authentication. The location of the certificate file must be specified using the `--cacert`, `--key`, and `--cert` options or environment variables.

            This option is important when working with proxy servers that require TLS authentication, as failure to set it correctly may result in connection errors.
        proxy-tlspassword: '[AI] The `--proxy-tls-password` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data, is used to specify a password for TLS (Transport Layer Security) authenticated proxies. When making requests through such a proxy, this option ensures that `curl` provides the correct password during the TLS handshake, enabling the secure connection between the client and the proxy server.'
        proxy-tlsuser: '[AI] The `--proxy-tlsuser` option in `curl` is used to specify a custom username for authentication when making HTTPS requests through a proxy server. It''s an element of the TLS (Transport Layer Security) certification verification process during the SSL/TLS handshake, which helps ensure secure communication between your machine and the remote server via the proxy. Providing this option enhances security by enforcing proper user identification for proxied HTTPS transactions.'
        proxy-tlsv1: '[AI] The `--proxy-tlsv1` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data, is used to specify the version of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to use when making requests through an HTTP proxy that supports TLS encryption. Setting `--proxy-tlsv1` instructs curl to use TLS version 1 when communicating with the proxy server. It''s important to ensure that both the client and the proxy support the same TLS version for secure data transfer.'
        proxy-user: '[AI] The `--proxy-user` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, is used to specify the username for basic authentication when making requests through a proxy server. When using this option, `curl` includes the provided username and password (which can be given together with `--proxy-password`) in the HTTP `Authorization` header during the request. This allows accessing resources behind a proxy that requires authentication.'
        proxy1.0: '[AI] The `--proxy1.0` option in cURL is used to enable Proxy Protocol version 1.0 support in cURL''s HTTPS requests. Proxy Protocol is a transport protocol designed for forwarding network traffic from clients through intermediaries, such as proxies or load balancers. By using this option, cURL sends the client''s IP address and other connection information to the proxy server along with the request data, enabling more precise traffic logging and load balancing functionality.'
        proxytunnel: '[AI] The `--proxytunnel` option in cURL is used to set up a HTTP or HTTPS proxy that acts as a SOCKS proxy, allowing for transparent proxy authentication and the ability to pass arbitrary data between the application and the proxy, creating an encrypted tunnel. This can be useful when dealing with proxies that require additional authentication methods beyond basic authentication or when working with restrictive networks. The flag configures cURL to initiate an SSL-encrypted connection to the proxy server before sending the data through it.'
        pubkey: '[AI] The `--pubkey` option in the CURL command-line tool is used to specify the path to a public key file when performing SSL/TLS certificate verification during an HTTPS transfer. This helps ensure that the server''s presented certificate matches a trusted certificate, enhancing security and data confidentiality during communication between client and server.'
        quote: '[AI] The `--quote` option in cURL is used to automatically quote and URL-encode HTTP request headers with special characters or spaces, ensuring they are properly formatted for transmission to the server. This helps prevent potential errors caused by incorrectly formatted headers.'
        random-file: '[AI] `curl --random-file` is a command-line option used with the `curl` utility in Unix-based systems for transferring data between a client and a server using various protocols such as HTTP, FTP, etc. The `--random-file` option causes `curl` to download a file from a URL and save it with a random name in a specified directory instead of overwriting any existing file with the same name as the remote file. If no output directory is provided, `curl` will save the file in the current working directory. This can be useful when downloading multiple files with identical names from different URLs to avoid naming conflicts.'
        range: '[AI] `curl --range` is a feature in the `curl` command-line tool used for transferring data between a client and server using various communication protocols. The `--range` option allows downloading only a specific range of bytes from an HTTP or FTP server. The syntax is `--range START-BYTE:END-BYTE`, where `START-BYTE` and `END-BYTE` define the starting byte number and ending byte number, respectively, of the desired data range. This option is useful for resuming interrupted downloads or for retrieving a portion of a large file.'
        raw: |-
            [AI] `curl --raw` is a command-line option used with the `curl` tool in Linux and other Unix-based systems for transferring data between a client and server using various communication protocols, such as HTTP, FTP, etc.

            When used with `--raw`, `curl` will not apply any content decoding or transformation on the transferred data. It simply sends raw data between the client and server without modifying it in any way. This can be useful for inspecting low-level details of the transferred data, such as HTTP headers or binary files, without having `curl` interfere with the data.
        referer: '[AI] The `--referer` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data, is used to set the HTTP referer header in the request. The referer header indicates the URL of the webpage that caused the current request to be made. Setting this header can help websites or applications keep track of user navigation and implement certain functionalities based on it. For instance, some websites may redirect or deny access based on the referer information. However, note that manipulating the referer header might violate terms of service or privacy policies, and its use should comply with ethical guidelines and relevant laws.'
        remote-header-name: '[AI] The `--remote-header-names` option in `curl` is used to include the names of all headers received from the remote server in the response. By default, `curl` sends and includes header names prefixed with "X-" or ":" in responses but only shows the values in the output. With this option, both names and values are displayed for all headers.'
        remote-name: '[AI] The `--remote-name` option in `curl` is used to specify that the remote file name should be used as the local file name when downloading a file using curl. This can be helpful when downloading files from FTP or HTTP servers where the file names on the remote server may differ from desired local file names. By using `--remote-name`, `curl` will automatically use the original file name when saving the downloaded data to a local file.'
        remote-name-all: '[AI] The `--remote-name-all` option in `curl` is used to download multiple files from a single URL, giving each file a local name based on its original remote name. In other words, it preserves the original file name of each remote file during the download process. This can be useful when dealing with large numbers of files or when maintaining consistency between remote and local file names.'
        remote-time: '[AI] The `--remote-time` option in `curl` is used to make the server determine the file transfer time and modification time. When this option is set, `curl` will send an If-Modify-Since or If-Unmodified-Since header based on the modification time of the local file (if it exists), but if no local file exists, it will not send any conditional headers. This can be useful when downloading files and ensuring that you always get the most recent version.'
        request: '[AI] `curl --request` is a command-line option used with the curl utility to specify the HTTP request method for making requests to a URL. The option takes as its value the desired HTTP method such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`. For example, `curl --request GET https://example.com` sends a GET request to the specified URL.'
        request-target: |-
            [AI] The `--request-target` option in cURL is used to specify the HTTP method and URL path for an HTTP request. The syntax is as follows: `--request-target METHOD PATH`. Here, `METHOD` can be any valid HTTP method such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., and `PATH` is the relative or absolute URL to the resource on the server.

            For example, to send a GET request to the root path of a server, you would use: `curl --request-target GET /`. To send a POST request with data to a specific endpoint, you would use: `curl --request-target POST /api/endpoint --data "key=value"`.

            In summary, the `--request-target` option in cURL allows for specifying both the HTTP method and URL path in one command for making HTTP requests.
        resolve: '[AI] `--resolve` is an option used with the command-line tool `curl`. It allows users to specify custom DNS resolver addresses or hosts files to be used for name resolution during a `curl` request. This can be useful in situations where the default DNS resolver may not provide accurate results, such as when using a VPN or accessing content from a specific region or network. The option takes one or more arguments specifying the addresses or hosts files to use. For example: `curl --resolve example.com:8.8.8.8 --resolve anotherdomain:8.5.5.5 <URL>`.'
        retry: '[AI] The `--retry` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, specifies that curl should retry a failed transfer. It takes an argument which sets the number of times curl will retry and the delay between retries. For example, `--retry 3` means curl will attempt the transfer three times if it fails initially, with a default exponential backoff strategy between retries to avoid overwhelming the server. If successful, the transfer will continue without interruption.'
        retry-connrefused: '[AI] `curl` is a command-line tool used to transfer data between a client and a server. The option `--retry-connrefused` enables automatic retries when a connection attempt fails due to a refused connection error (TCP RST packet). This flag instructs `curl` to wait for the specified number of seconds before attempting another connection. If no delay is specified, it defaults to 5 seconds. After reaching the maximum number of retries or elapsed time, `curl` will give up and report the failure. This option can be useful when dealing with intermittent network connectivity or server issues.'
        retry-delay: '[AI] `--retry-delay` is an option used with the `curl` command in HTTP and FTP data transfer protocols. It sets the time interval, in milliseconds, between retries when a transfer fails due to network issues or server side errors. The flag helps prevent excessive retries during network instability or temporary server issues, allowing for a more stable and efficient transfer process.'
        retry-max-time: '[AI] `--retry-max-time` is an option used with the command-line tool `curl`. It sets a maximum time in seconds for curl to wait before giving up on a failed transfer due to network problems, such as a connection that drops or becomes unresponsive. If the transfer fails and the elapsed time since the start of the transfer exceeds this limit, curl will abandon the attempt and raise an error. This option can help prevent endless loops of retry attempts in cases where it is unlikely for the connection to be restored.'
        sasl-authzid: |-
            [AI] The `--sasl-authzid` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data with URL syntax, is used to specify an Authentication ID (authzid) for Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanisms.

            When making authenticated requests to certain servers, `curl` can be configured to provide the desired authentication ID as part of the SASL negotiation process. The `--sasl-authzid` option allows you to explicitly set this value for your particular use case.

            For example:
            ```
            curl --user <username>:<password> --sasl-authzid <your_authzid> <URL>
            ```
            Replace `<username>:<password>` with the appropriate credentials for the server, and `<your_authzid>` with the desired authentication ID. This command will send both the username/password combination and the specified authzid during SASL negotiation.
        sasl-ir: '[AI] The `--sasl-iral` option in `curl` is used to enable Interactive Reauthentication (IR) for Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanism in HTTP or FTP transfers. With this option, `curl` will not automatically retry failed authentication attempts but instead ask the user for new credentials if necessary during the transfer process. This can be useful when dealing with dynamic or complex authentication environments where different sets of credentials are required for each transfer. The user is expected to provide valid credentials manually when prompted, allowing for greater control and flexibility in managing authentication for each individual transfer.'
        service-name: '[AI] The `--service-name` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, is used to specify a name for the service or endpoint being accessed. This information is sent with the request and can be useful for identifying the service in logs or other diagnostic output. It does not affect how the request is processed or the response received.'
        show-error: '[AI] `--show-error` is a command-line option for the `curl` utility, which is used to transfer data between a client and a server. This option instructs curl to display any error messages it encounters during the transfer or execution of a command in standard output (stdout), instead of silencing them or writing them to a file as defined by other options like `--silent` or `--quiet`. It helps users diagnose issues with their requests more easily.'
        silent: '[AI] The `--silent` or `-s` option used with the `curl` command suppresses the output of the command, meaning that no text will be displayed on the terminal during the transfer. This is useful when automating tasks or running scripts where you do not want any unwanted output interfering with other processes.'
        socks4: '[AI] The `--socks4` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server, is used to configure `curl` to use SOCKS Version 4 as the protocol for connecting to remote servers through a SOCKS proxy. With this option, all network traffic from `curl` will go through the specified SOCKS proxy server instead of directly to the internet, adding an extra layer of security or bypassing certain firewalls. The proxy address and port number should be provided in the URL or as separate options when using this flag.'
        socks4a: '[AI] The `--socks4a` option in cURL is used to enable SOCKS Version 4 Authenticated (SOCKS4A) proxy support. It allows cURL to connect to a SOCKS proxy server and authenticate using a username and password before sending the request. This can be useful when accessing resources over a proxy that requires authentication. The "a" in `--socks4a` stands for "authenticated".'
        socks5: |-
            [AI] The `--socks5` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, is used to enable SOCKS5 proxy support. SOCKS5 is a protocol that allows encrypted proxying of various kinds of traffic, including TCP and UDP. With this option, you can specify a SOCKS5 proxy server address and port number to use for your `curl` requests, making it useful for accessing restricted networks or circumventing firewalls. The basic syntax is:

            ```bash
            curl --socks5 <proxy_address>:<proxy_port> [other_options] URL
            ```
        socks5-basic: |-
            [AI] The `--socks5-basic` option is a feature in cURL, a popular command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server using various protocols, such as HTTP, FTP, SSH, etc. This option enables SOCKS version 5 proxy support with basic authentication.

            When using `--socks5-basic`, you need to provide the address and port of your SOCKS proxy server followed by the username and password in the format: `<proxy_address>:<port>:<username>:<password>`. For example, `--socks5-basic socks5.example.com:1080 user:pass`. This will make cURL use this proxy with the provided authentication details when making requests.
        socks5-gssapi: '[AI] The `--socks5-gssapi` option in cURL is used to enable GSS-API (Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface) authentication for SOCKS5 proxy connections. This provides an extra layer of security by adding support for Kerberos authentication, which is widely used in enterprise environments for secure network access. With this option enabled, cURL can authenticate with a Kerberos server before making requests through the SOCKS5 proxy, ensuring that only authorized users are able to access the resources behind it.'
        socks5-gssapi-nec: '[AI] The `--socks5-gssapi-nec` flag is an option for the `curl` command-line tool, used to make HTTP requests. This flag enables GSS-API Negotiate over SOCKS5 proxy connections. In simpler terms, it allows `curl` to authenticate with a Kerberos server before establishing a connection through a SOCKS5 proxy using the security mechanism provided by the GSS-API protocol.'
        socks5-gssapi-service: |-
            [AI] The `--socks5-gssapi-service` option is a command-line argument for the `curl` utility, which is a popular tool used to transfer data between a client and a server using various protocols. This specific option configures `curl` to use GSS-API (Generic Security Services Application Program Interface) authentication when connecting through a SOCKS5 proxy server.

            GSS-API is a widely-used mechanism for securing network communications, which provides strong authentication and encryption capabilities. With the `--socks5-gssapi-service` option, `curl` will attempt to authenticate with the SOCKS5 proxy using GSS-API instead of traditional username/password credentials.

            In summary, this flag enables secure authentication (using GSS-API) when connecting through a SOCKS5 proxy server with curl.
        socks5-hostname: '[AI] The `--socks5-hostname` option in `curl` is used to specify the hostname or IP address of the SOCKS5 proxy server. When making an HTTP or other network request with `curl`, this option allows you to connect through a SOCKS5 proxy, which can be useful for bypassing firewalls or accessing restricted networks. By providing the proxy''s hostname or IP address with `--socks5-hostname`, `curl` is able to establish a secure connection to the proxy server before making the requested network request.'
        speed-limit: |-
            [AI] The `--speed-limit` option in `curl` is used to set a maximum transfer speed for the data being transferred during a command. This can be helpful when working with limited bandwidth connections or when wanting to limit the amount of data being transferred at once to prevent network congestion.

            The option takes two values: the first is the transfer rate in bytes per second, and the second is an optional suffix indicating the unit of measurement (K for kilobytes per second, M for megabytes per second, etc.). For example, `--speed-limit 10M` sets a maximum transfer speed of 10 megabytes per second.

            If the rate limit is exceeded during a transfer, `curl` will pause the transfer and resume once the current data has been sent or received, up to the specified rate.
        speed-time: '[AI] The `--speed-time` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, displays the time taken to transfer each block of data during an HTTP or FTP transfer. It also shows the average and total transfer speeds as well as the elapsed time for the entire operation. The output is in human-readable format (e.g., "5.3KB/s 10.2MB in 2.4s") with the unit prefixes abbreviated (e.g., KB for kilobytes and MB for megabytes).'
        ssl: '[AI] `curl` is a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server over various protocols, including HTTP and HTTPS. The `--ssl` option in `curl` is used to enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) during the transfer of data with HTTPS protocol. This ensures that all communication between the client and server is encrypted for enhanced security.'
        ssl-allow-beast: |-
            [AI] The `--ssl-allow-beast` option in `curl` is a security feature that allows sending and receiving data over an SSL/TLS connection with known insecure or invalid certificates. It disables certificate verification, which is typically used to ensure the authenticity and trustworthiness of the SSL/TLS certificates.

            This option should be used with extreme caution, as it can expose your communication to man-in-the-middle attacks or other forms of eavesdropping. It's recommended only for testing or debugging purposes and in controlled environments where you fully understand the security implications.
        ssl-no-revoke: '[AI] The `--ssl-no-revoke` option in `curl` is used to disable SSL certificate revocation checking. When this option is set, `curl` will not perform OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) or CRL (Certificate Revocation List) checks during the SSL handshake. This means that `curl` will trust any SSL certificate it receives from a server without verifying if the certificate has been revoked. This can bypass important security checks and increase the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. It is generally not recommended to use this option except in specific situations where certificate revocation checking may cause issues, such as when dealing with self-signed or intermediary certificates.'
        ssl-reqd: '[AI] The `--ssl-reqd` option in `curl` is used to require that the URL or protocol being accessed supports and uses SSL/TLS encryption. In other words, it ensures that the data transfer between the client (curl) and the server is secured with a valid SSL/TLS certificate. If the URL does not use SSL/TLS, curl will return an error.'
        ssl-revoke-best-effort: '[AI] The `--ssl-revoke-best-effort` option in the `curl` command line tool is used to instruct curl to perform an additional check on SSL certificates during TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshakes. It requests that curl revokes certificates that have been flagged as compromised or otherwise invalid, even if they are still trusted by the system''s CA (Certificate Authority) store. This helps improve security by ensuring that curls does not unintentionally use compromised certificates for secure communications. If a match is found, curl will print an error message and terminate the connection attempt.'
        sslv2: '[AI] The `--sslv2` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server, specifies that SSL version 2 should be used for secure data transmission. It is an outdated protocol due to known vulnerabilities and security risks, so its use is discouraged in favor of more modern and secure versions such as SSLv3 or TLS.'
        sslv3: '[AI] The `--sslv3` option in the `curl` command-line tool specifies that SSL version 3 should be used for secure data transfer over HTTPS connections. This option is useful when interacting with servers that only support SSLv3 or when testing SSLv3 compatibility, but it''s generally discouraged due to known security vulnerabilities in the protocol. It''s recommended to use TLS (Transport Layer Security) versions 1.2 or 1.3 instead for secure communication.'
        stderr: '[AI] The `--stderr` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server, instructs curl to send error messages to the standard error stream (stderr) instead of mixing them with regular output (stdout). This can be useful when you want to distinguish error messages from normal output and redirect stdout elsewhere.'
        styled-output: '[AI] The `--styled-output` option in `curl` is used to format the output in a human-readable way with syntax highlighting and indentation, making it easier to read and understand, particularly when dealing with JSON or XML data. It''s typically used in conjunction with other options to send and receive data over various protocols such as HTTP, FTP, etc. The default format is JSON, but other formats like YAML or XML can be specified using additional flags.'
        suppress-connect-headers: '[AI] The `--suppress-connect-headers` option in `curl` is used to suppress the sending of Connect headers during an HTTP transfer. Connect headers are optional headers that can be included with a request to provide additional information about the client and the connection, such as user agent information or connection keep-alive directives. By using this option, you can send requests without including these headers. This might be desirable in certain situations, such as when making automated tests or scripts where consistent behavior is important across multiple requests.'
        tcp-fastopen: |-
            [AI] `curl` is a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server using various protocols, including HTTP and HTTPS. The `--tcp-fastopen` option is used to enable TCP Fast Open (TFO) in the curl transfer.

            TCP Fast Open is an extension to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that allows the client to initiate a new connection with the server's data as soon as the initial handshake is completed, reducing the latency and improving the overall transfer performance. By using `--tcp-fastopen`, curl takes advantage of this feature when connecting to servers that support it.
        tcp-nodelay: '[AI] The `--tcp-nodelay` option in cURL is used to disable the Nagle algorithm for TCP connections. This algorithm delays sending partial data packets until a larger amount of data is available, aiming to reduce network traffic and improve performance. However, it can also lead to increased latency in interactive applications due to the delay in sending smaller packets. By disabling this algorithm with `--tcp-nodelay`, cURL sends data as soon as it''s available, which might be beneficial for certain use cases like web browsing or transferring small files.'
        telnet-option: '[AI] The `--telnet-option` flag in `curl` is used to enable Telnet options during a connection. Telnet is an obsolete protocol for remotely accessing and controlling other devices, providing interactive sessions over the internet. With this option, you can send specific Telnet commands alongside your data during the transfer to modify the connection behavior, such as sending a "SUPpress-GO Ahead" (SGIA) command to suppress the "Go Ahead" message sent by the server before transmitting large data. However, since Telnet is insecure and can be vulnerable to attacks, it''s generally recommended to use more secure alternatives like SSH or TLS for remote access and data transfer.'
        tftp-blksize: '[AI] The `--tftp-blksize` option in cURL is used to set the TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) block size for a transfer. It specifies the number of bytes per packet during a TFTP transaction. A larger block size can result in faster transfers, while smaller block sizes may be required for systems with limited memory or processing power. By default, cURL sets this value to 512 bytes.'
        tftp-no-options: '[AI] The `--tftp-no-options` flag in cURL is used to disable the sending of any options during a TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) transfer. This can be useful when you want to manually manage and specify all options for the transfer instead of relying on cURL''s default settings. By disabling options, you have more control over the TFTP transfer and can ensure that it adheres to specific requirements or protocols.'
        time-cond: '[AI] The `--time-cond` option in `curl` is used to specify time-related conditions for HTTP requests. It takes an expression in the format of cron syntax, which defines a schedule for when the request should be executed. For example, `"@every 5 minutes"` or `"0 9 * * MON-FRI"`. When curl performs a request based on this option, it will check if the current time matches the specified condition and only execute the request if it does. This can be useful for automating repetitive tasks at specific intervals.'
        tls-max: '[AI] The `--tls-max` option in `curl` is used to set the maximum version of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol that the library should attempt to use during an SSL/TLS transfer. It allows users to specify a specific TLS version number or a major version, such as `--tls-max 1.2` for TLS version 1.2 or `--tls-max TLSv1_3` for TLS version 1.3. The default behavior is for curl to use the highest available protocol on the system. This option is helpful in implementing security policies that enforce the usage of specific TLS versions to ensure compatibility and enhance security.'
        tls13-ciphers: |-
            [AI] The `--tls13-ciphers` option in `curl`, a popular command-line tool for transferring data, is used to specify the preferred TLS 1.3 ciphersuites for secure communications between the client and server. Ciphersuites are a combination of encryption algorithms, key exchange methods, and message authentication codes that provide confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity during network communication.

            By default, `curl` supports a wide range of TLS versions and ciphersuites. However, using `--tls13-ciphers` allows you to restrict the supported ciphersuites to only those that adhere to the TLS 1.3 protocol for enhanced security. It helps in preventing the usage of older, less secure ciphersuites and ensures a more robust and up-to-date encryption setup.

            Example usage: `curl --tls13 --tls13-ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 https://example.com`

            This command enables TLS 1.3 and restricts the supported ciphersuites to those using ECDHE key exchange, AES-GCM or CHACHA20-POLY1305 encryption, and SHA-256 for message authentication.
        tlsauthtype: |-
            [AI] The `--tlsauthtype` option in `curl` is used to specify the type of TLS authentication to employ when making an HTTPS request. It accepts the following values:

            1. `no`: Disables any client certificate verification. This can be risky and should only be used for testing or insecure connections.
            2. `password`: Authenticates using a pre-shared secret (certificate and key are not needed).
            3. `cert:`: Specifies the path to a client certificate file (in PEM format) and its private key, if needed.
            4. `key:`: Specifies the path to a client private key file (in PEM format). It's used when no certificate is provided or when the certificate is included in the CA bundle.
            5. `p12:`: Specifies the path to a personal identity certificate (P12) file that contains both the client certificate and its private key, all in one file.
            6. `cafile:`: Path to a file containing a list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) for verification. If not provided, curl uses the system CA certificates.

            Using the appropriate authentication type ensures secure communication between the client and server during an HTTPS transaction.
        tlspassword: '[AI] The `--tls-password` option in `curl` is used to specify a file containing SSL/TLS certificates and their corresponding passwords. This flag is useful when making HTTPS requests with `curl` that require client certificate authentication. The password for each certificate is stored in plain text in the specified file, one password per line, to be provided during the SSL/TLS handshake. The file should have a .p12 or .pem format and be readable by `curl`.'
        tlsuser: |-
            [AI] The `--tls-VERSION`, `--cert`, and `--key` options in cURL are used to configure SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication with servers over HTTPS. The `--tls-auth` option introduces a new feature called TLS Client Certificates, which is where the `--tls-user` flag comes into play.

            The `--tls-user` flag specifies the path to a PEM or PKCS12 format file containing the private key and associated certificate for client authentication during HTTPS communications. When this option is used, cURL will present the specified certificate during the SSL/TLS handshake instead of relying on system certificates.

            In summary, `--tls-user` in cURL allows you to specify a custom client certificate and its corresponding private key file for secure communication over HTTPS using TLS Client Certificate authentication.
        tlsv1: '[AI] The `--tlsv1` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data, specifies that the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1 should be used for secure data transfers over the network. TLS is a cryptographic protocol providing secure communication between two parties and it has multiple versions, with TLSv1 being the oldest one but still supported in some environments due to backward compatibility requirements. This option ensures that the connection will use only TLS version 1 for securing the data transfer.'
        tlsv1.0: '[AI] The `--tlsv1.0` option in `curl` is used to specify that the Transfer Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.0 should be used during the communication between the client and the server. This option ensures that only TLS v1.0 is used, disabling any other potentially less secure versions of the TLS protocol. Using this option can help improve security by limiting the attack surface for SSL/TLS related vulnerabilities. However, it''s important to note that TLS v1.0 has known vulnerabilities and is considered insecure by some organizations, so using it should be done with caution and only when necessary.'
        tlsv1.1: '[AI] The `--tlsv1.1` option in `curl`, a popular command-line tool for transferring data between a client and a server, specifies that the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.1 should be used during the communication. This ensures that the connection between the client and the server uses the more secure TLS version 1.1 protocol instead of older, potentially less secure versions.'
        tlsv1.2: '[AI] The `--tlsv1.2` option in `curl` is used to specify that the transfer protocol for the SSL/TLS communication should be version TLS v1.2. This option ensures that `curl` uses only the TLS v1.2 protocol while making secure HTTPS connections, providing enhanced security features and addressing known vulnerabilities in older TLS versions.'
        tlsv1.3: '[AI] The `--tlsv1.3` flag for the `curl` command line tool specifies that SSL/TLS connections should be established using TLS version 1.3. This is an secure and recent version of the transport layer security protocol, providing improved encryption, authentication, and key exchange methods compared to earlier versions. Using this flag helps ensure secure data transmission during network communications.'
        tr-encoding: |-
            [AI] The `--trace` option in cURL is used to enable and output detailed information about the request being made, including the HTTP method, headers, data sent, and the server's response.

            The `--trace-ascii` or `--output-file <FILE>` flags are used to save this output to a file in either ASCII or binary format, respectively. The `--tr-encoding` option modifies the output encoding of this trace data when saving it to a file. Specifically, it sets the encoding to UTF-8, which is the default character encoding for modern text data. Therefore, using `--trace-ascii --tr-encoding utf-8` is equivalent to just using `--trace-ascii`. However, if you need to save the trace data in a different encoding, you can use an alternative encoding instead of 'utf-8'. For example, `--trace-ascii --tr-encoding latin1` would save the trace data in Latin-1 encoding.
        trace: '[AI] `curl` is a command-line tool used to transfer data between a client and a server using various protocols, such as HTTP or FTP. The `--trace` option in `curl` enables verbose output that records the low-level details of the transfer, including the requests and responses sent between `curl` and the server. This information is written to a file specified with the `--trace-file` option or printed to the console if no file is provided. The resulting trace file contains timestamps, protocol details, headers, data, and error messages for each request and response, offering insights into network communication and helping diagnose issues.'
        trace-ascii: '[AI] `curl --trace-ascii` is a command-line option used with the curl utility to enable printing of libcurl''s trace messages in plain ASCII format instead of the default verbose binary format. This makes it easier for humans to read and understand the detailed low-level information about the HTTP/FTP transfer, such as requests and responses headers, data exchanged between client and server, SSL/TLS information, and error messages.'
        trace-time: '[AI] The `--trace-time` option in `curl` is used to display the elapsed time for each major event during a transfer, such as connecting to the server, sending the request, receiving the response, and so on. It provides detailed timing information to help diagnose performance issues or optimize transfer speeds. The output is written to stderr and includes timestamps for better visibility.'
        unix-socket: '[AI] `curl --unix-socket` is a command-line option used with the `curl` tool to specify a Unix domain socket as the connection endpoint instead of a traditional HTTP(S) URL. A Unix domain socket is a type of IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mechanism that allows different processes running on the same machine to communicate with each other using named pipes and sockets. By providing `--unix-socket` followed by the path to the socket file, `curl` will establish a connection over this socket for data transfer, often used in communicating with services like Redis or gRPC servers.'
        upload-file: |-
            [AI] The `--upload-file` option in `curl` is used to upload a file as part of an HTTP POST request. When used, `curl` sends the contents of the specified file as the body of the POST request. The flag takes one argument which is the local file path to be uploaded. For example:

            ```bash
            curl --upload-file /path/to/local/file.txt http://example.com/api/upload
            ```

            This command sends a POST request to `http://example.com/api/upload` with the file located at `/path/to/local/file.txt` as the body of the request. The remote server should be configured to accept and process the uploaded file accordingly.
        url: '[AI] The `--url` option in `curl` is used to specify the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the request to be sent. It sets the address for the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request, and curl will send a request to that location. This option is particularly useful when making requests using the command line interface with curl.'
        use-ascii: '[AI] The `--use-ascii` flag in `curl` is used to instruct curl to treat the content received as if it was ASCII data, even if the file being transferred has a different declared character encoding or Content-Type header. This can be useful when dealing with files that are mislabeled or when you want to force ASCII decoding for compatibility purposes. However, note that this flag may result in data loss for non-ASCII characters.'
        user: '[AI] The `--user` option in the `curl` command-line tool is used to specify basic authentication credentials for an HTTP or FTP transfer. It takes one argument, a string in the format of "username:password". For example, `--user myusername:mypassword`. This allows automatic authentication when making requests to protected resources without having to manually enter the credentials each time.'
        user-agent: '[AI] The `--user-agent` option in `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server, is used to specify a custom User-Agent string. A User-Agent identifies the application making the request to the server. This option allows users to hide or set their User-Agent string, which can be useful for privacy concerns or testing how web services respond differently to various user agents. The specified user agent string will be sent in the `User-Agent` header of the HTTP request.'
        verbose: '[AI] `curl --verbose` is a command-line option used with the cURL data transfer utility. It turns on verbose mode, which increases the output of information while executing an HTTP request or transfer operation. This includes displaying more details about the progress of the request such as URLs being accessed, headers exchanged between client and server, and response codes received. The output is typically printed to the console for debugging and diagnostic purposes.'
        version: '[AI] `curl --version` is a command used in Unix-based systems to check the version information of the installed cURL utility. cURL is a free and open-source software library and command-line tool for transferring data between or among different types and sizes of computers. The `--version` option displays the version number, compilation options, and other information about the installed cURL build.'
        write-out: '[AI] The `--write-out` option in `curl` is used to customize the output format when downloading a file using this command-line tool. With this option, you can specify which headers or other data to display or save along with the content of the file. For example, you may use `--write-out ''%{size_download}\n''` to print the size of the downloaded file in bytes to the standard output after the transfer is completed. The format string inside `%{}` brackets refers to various curl variables.'
        xattr: '[AI] The `--xattr` option in `curl` is used to interact with extended file attributes. It allows you to read, write or remove named xattrs (extended file attributes) using the `-X` flag followed by the desired action ("list" for reading, "set" for writing, and "remove" for removing). This can be useful when working with files that have complex metadata, as extended attributes are not limited to the standard attributes like size, permissions, and ownership.'
