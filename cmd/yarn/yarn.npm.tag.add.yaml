        [AI] The `yarn npm tag add` command is used to add a new tag to an existing Git repository associated with an npm package. It's typically run from the root directory of the project in a terminal or command prompt. Here are the steps involved:

        1. First, ensure your local repository is up-to-date with the latest changes by running `git pull origin main` or the branch name you're working on.
        2. Create a new tag using the desired version number and message: `git tag <version> -m "Message describing the changes in this release"`.
        3. Add the tag to your local repository: `git push origin <tag>`.
        4. Finally, update the npm registry with the new tag by running `yarn npm tag add <version>`. This command pushes the new tag to the remote npm registry, making it available for other developers to install that version of your package.
