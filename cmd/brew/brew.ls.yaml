    --debug: Display any debugging information.
    --formula: List only formulae, or treat all named arguments as formulae.
    --full-name: Print formulae with fully-qualified names. Unless `--full-name`, `--versions` or `--pinned` are passed, other options (i.e. `-1`, `-l`, `-r` and `-t`) are passed to `ls`(1) which produces the actual output.

    "-1": Force output to be one entry per line. This is the default when output is not to a terminal.
    -l: List formulae and/or casks in long format. Has no effect when a formula or cask name is passed as an argument.
    -r: Reverse the order of the formulae and/or casks sort to list the oldest entries first. Has no effect when a formula or cask name is passed as an argument.
    -t: Sort formulae and/or casks by time modified, listing most recently modified first. Has no effect when a formula or cask name is passed as an argument.

    command: '[AI] `brew ls` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command lists out the installed Homebrew packages and their versions in the terminal interface, providing a quick overview of the currently installed software.'
    flag:
        "1": |-
            [AI] The command `brew ls -1` is a combination of Homebrew (a package manager for macOS) and the `ls` (List) command with the `-1` option.

            The `ls` command lists the files and directories in a directory. With the `-1` option, it displays one file or directory per line with detailed information such as file size, permissions, owner, group, and modification time.

            When you run `brew ls -1`, Homebrew prepends the output with additional information like the formula name, installed version, and installation path for each item managed by Homebrew in your system. This command is commonly used to list the details of all installed packages or formulas in Homebrew.
        cask: '[AI] `brew ls --cask` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command lists the installed Cask (formerly called Caskroom) packages, which are applications that aren''t distributed through the regular macOS App Store but can be installed using Homebrew. The output shows the name, version number, and installation path of each installed Cask package.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew ls --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to list out installed packages and their files with extended debug information. The `--debug` flag increases the amount of output to include more detailed data such as file paths, versions, and installation dates, which can be helpful for troubleshooting or getting a better understanding of Homebrew''s internal organization.'
        formula: '[AI] `brew ls --formula` is a command used in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. This command lists all installed Homebrew packages (also called "formulas") along with their respective versions and installation paths. The output is displayed in a tabular format for easy reading.'
        full-name: '[AI] `brew ls --full-name` is a command used with Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. This command lists installed Homebrew packages or formulas along with their full paths in the file system. The `--full-name` option ensures that the output includes the complete path to each formula or package, providing more detailed and comprehensive information about the installed software.'
        help: '[AI] `brew ls --help` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--help` option requests detailed help information about the given Homebrew command. In this case, `brew ls` is the command, which lists out installed Homebrew packages and their versions, along with any outdated or broken dependencies. By adding `--help`, users can view a comprehensive description of what `brew ls` does, how to use it with different options, and other relevant information.'
        l: '[AI] The command `brew ls -l` is used in the Homebrew package manager for macOS or Linux systems. The `ls` stands for list, and the `-l` flag means "long format." So, this command lists the installed Homebrew packages in a long format that includes details such as file permissions, number of hard links, owner, group, size, and modification time.'
        multiple: |-
            [AI] The `brew ls --multiple` command is not a valid command in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. There seems to be a mistake in the given command as it should be either `brew list` or `brew ls`, without the `--multiple` option.

            The correct `brew list` command lists all installed packages and their versions, while `brew ls` lists the files that belong to Homebrew-managed formulas and casks in the Cellar directory. These commands do not return output in any particular format other than a simple listing by default. If you need specific formatting or multiple outputs, you may use options like `--verbose`, `--quiet`, or `--long` for more details.
        pinned: '[AI] `brew ls --pinned` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command lists all the packages that are currently pinned (also known as fixed or manually managed) in the Homebrew installation. The output shows each pinned package name and its current version. By default, Homebrew automatically updates installed packages to their latest versions. However, using `--pinned` allows users to maintain specific versions for certain packages.'
        quiet: '[AI] The command `brew ls --quiet` is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--quiet` flag (also spelled `-q`) instructs Homebrew to output only the names of installed packages without any extra information or formatting. Therefore, this command lists only the names of installed Homebrew packages, each on a new line.'
        r: '[AI] The command `brew ls -r` is used with Homebrew, a package manager for macOS, to list all installed Homebrew packages recursively with their deepest subdirectories. The `ls` stands for list, and the `-r` option means to list the files and directories in reverse order of how they were originally arranged (i.e., with deepest subdirectories listed first). This command provides a comprehensive view of all Homebrew installations on your system, which can be helpful for various purposes such as troubleshooting or inventory management.'
        t: '[AI] The command `brew ls -t` is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command lists all installed Homebrew packages sorted by their last installation or update time, with the newest packages first. The `-t` option specifies this sorting behavior.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew ls --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output provided by the `ls` (list) command, displaying detailed information about each installed Homebrew package or formula, including its installation path and version number.'
        versions: '[AI] `brew ls --versions` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command lists all installed Homebrew packages and their current versions in a tabular format, showing the name of the package, its version number, and the installation path. It provides a quick overview of the software installations managed by Homebrew and can help in identifying which version of a particular package is currently in use.'
