documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `gh mintty` command is not a standard Linux or Unix command, but rather specific to Git for Windows (Git-Bash). It''s actually a shortcut for opening a terminal window using the Mintty terminal emulator which comes bundled with Git-Bash. This allows users to run Bash commands in a native Windows terminal with improved text rendering and ANSI color support.'
