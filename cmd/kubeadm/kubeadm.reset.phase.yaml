        [AI] `kubeadm reset` is a command used to reset and reconfigure a Kubernetes cluster managed by `kubeadm`. The command can be followed by different phases to indicate the extent of the reset:

        1. `init`: Resets the Kubernetes control-plane components and removes the certificates and keys for the etcd, kube-apiserver, and kubelet services.
        2. `cluster`: Resets the entire cluster including the control plane and nodes. This includes removing all Kubernetes components, purging persistent volumes, and clearing etcd data.
        3. `node <NODE_NAME>`: Resets a specific node without affecting the rest of the cluster.

        The "phase" argument specifies which part of the reset process to execute. For example, running `kubeadm reset cluster` would initiate a full cluster reset, while `kubeadm reset init` would only reset the control plane components.
