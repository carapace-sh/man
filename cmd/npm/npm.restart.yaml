documentation:
    command: '[AI] `npm restart` is a command used in Node.js projects to perform a rolling restart of your Node.js application. This means that it will first gracefully stop the current Node.js process, then start a new one to take its place. It uses signals to perform this action, ensuring minimal downtime for your application. The `restart` script is typically defined in your `package.json` file under the "scripts" section, allowing you to easily execute it with a single command.'
    flag:
        ignore-scripts: '[AI] The `npm restart` command is a common way to restart Node.js projects with their built-in scripts, usually defined in the `package.json` file. The `--ignore-scripts` flag modifies this behavior and restarts the project without executing any scripts. This can be useful when you want to manually manage the startup process or debug the scripts without their side effects.'
        script-shell: '[AI] The `npm restart` command with the `--script-shell` option is used to restart a Node.js application and execute its start script using a specific shell environment. This can be useful in situations where you need to run scripts that are specific to your operating system or require certain environment variables, which may not be supported by Node.js directly. The `--script-shell` option allows you to specify the name of the shell interpreter, such as `bash`, `csh`, or `powershell`, followed by the script file name. For example, `npm restart --script-shell bash scripts/start.sh` would restart your application and execute the `scripts/start.sh` file using Bash.'
