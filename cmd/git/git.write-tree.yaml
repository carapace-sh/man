    --missing-ok: allow missing objects
    --prefix=: write tree object for a subdirectory <prefix>
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git write-tree` is a Git command used to write a new tree object to the Git database based on the current state of the working directory or an index. It calculates the SHA-1 checksum for the tree and writes it to a file, typically named as `TREE_FILE`, which is then committed using other Git commands. This command is often used when implementing custom Git hooks or scripts that require creating a new commit with a specific tree object.'
    flag:
        missing-ok: '[AI] `git write-tree --missing-ok` is a Git command used to create a new tree object based on the current state of the files in the working directory. The `--missing-ok` option allows Git to include untracked files in the new tree without raising an error. Untracked files will be represented by their SHA-1 checksums as if they were blobs, not trees. This command does not update the index or the repository; it only creates the tree object and returns its SHA-1 hash.'
        prefix: '[AI] The `git write-tree` command is used to create a new tree object in Git, representing a snapshot of the file system. The option `--prefix=<path>` specifies that the tree should only include files and directories whose paths begin with the given prefix. This can be useful for creating a tree object for a specific subdirectory of a project, without including the entire repository. For example, `git write-tree --prefix=subdir/` would create a tree object containing only the files under the `subdir/` directory.'
