description: Manage Consul's ACL tokens
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul acl token` command is used in Consul, a Connect and Config Management platform by Hashicorp, to display or create new ACL (Access Control List) tokens. These tokens are used to grant specific permissions to Consul API clients. By default, the command lists all current tokens with their respective names, IDs, and scopes. However, it can also be used to create a new token by providing the desired name and scopes as arguments. For instance, `consul acl token create -name mytoken -policy "read=index.v1"` would create a new token named ''mytoken'' with read access to the Consul API version 1 index.'
