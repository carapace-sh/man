description: wait for device to be in given state
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `adb wait-for-usb-sideload` is a command used in Android Development to block further ADB (Android Debug Bridge) commands from running until the device is connected for USB sideloading. This is typically used during the installation of an update or new application via sideloading, where the user needs to approve the installation on their device before it can complete. The command ensures that the installation process waits for the device to be ready before continuing, providing a more reliable and error-free experience.'
