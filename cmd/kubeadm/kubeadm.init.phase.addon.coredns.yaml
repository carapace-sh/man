    command: |-
        [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool for initializing a Kubernetes cluster using Kubeadm, which is part of the Kubernetes distribution. The `phase addon` subcommand is used to install and manage addons in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm.

        The specific command `kubeadm init phase addon coredns` initializes or updates the CoreDNS addon for the Kubernetes cluster. CoreDNS is a multicast DNS server for Kubernetes clusters, which is used to resolve service names and labels into IP addresses within the cluster. This command adds or updates the CoreDNS deployment configuration in the Kubernetes cluster.

        config: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool for setting up a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase addon` subcommand is used to install additional components during the initialization process.

            The `coredns` addon is one such component that provides DNS services for a Kubernetes cluster. When you run the command `kubeadm init phase addon coredns --config`, it configures and installs the Coredns addon using the default configuration.

            Here's a brief explanation of each part:

            1. `kubeadm`: A tool for bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters.
            2. `init`: Initializes a new Kubernetes cluster or adds a node to an existing one.
            3. `phase addon`: Installs additional components during the initialization process.
            4. `coredns`: The name of the specific addon being installed, which provides DNS services for the cluster.
            5. `--config`: Specifies that the installation should use a custom configuration file (if provided), but in this case, no configuration file is specified, so it uses the default one.
        feature-gates: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool for bootstrapping a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase addon coredns --feature-gates` flag is used to install and enable the CoreDNS addon during initialization of a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm.

            CoreDNS is an open-source, flexible DNS server for Kubernetes created to replace the built-in kube-dns. It is designed to be highly performant, scalable, and easy to operate. The `--feature-gates` option enables experimental features in Kubernetes, and in this context, it allows activating CoreDNS as an addon during cluster setup.

            In summary, the flag `kubeadm init phase addon coredns --feature-gates` installs and enables the CoreDNS addon during the initialization of a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm.
        image-repository: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool for setting up a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm, a component of the Kubernetes control plane. The `addon` subcommand is used to install additional components, and in this case, `coredns` is being specified as the addon.

            The `--image-repository` flag specifies the container registry where the `coredns` image can be found. By default, it's set to the official Docker Hub repository (`gcr.io/kubernetes-elected/coredns:1.8.6`), but you can provide an alternative image source if needed.

            So, in summary, this command installs the CoreDNS addon for your Kubernetes cluster using the specified container image source.
        kubeconfig: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `addon` subcommand, specifically `coredns`, installs and configures the CoreDNS addon in the cluster.

            The option `--kubeconfig` generates and saves a new kubeconfig file, which is a configuration file for communicating with the cluster, into the specified path after executing the command.

            So, the complete command `kubeadm init phase addon coredns --kubeconfig <path-to-save-kubeconfig>` initializes the Kubernetes cluster, installs and configures CoreDNS as an addon, and saves a new kubeconfig file at the specified location.
        kubernetes-version: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `addon` subcommand, when used with `coredns`, installs the CoreDNS service as an addon during the initialization of the first master node in a Kubernetes cluster.

            The `--kubernetes-version` flag specifies the specific version of Kubernetes to use when installing the addon and initializing the cluster. It ensures that all components are installed with the same, specified version for consistency across the cluster.
        service-cidr: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool for initializing a Kubernetes cluster. The `addons` subcommand, when used with `coredns`, installs and configures the CoreDNS service in the cluster. The `--service-cidr` flag specifies the CIDR block (IP address range) that is reserved for cluster-internal services within the cluster''s network. This flag ensures that CoreDNS can properly route traffic to these services.'
        service-dns-domain: '[AI] The command `kubeadm init phase addon coredns --service-dns-domain` is used to install and configure the CoreDNS addon during the initialization of a Kubernetes cluster with Kubeadm. CoreDNS is an open-source, extensible DNS server that can be used as the central DNS service for a Kubernetes cluster. The `--service-dns-domain` flag specifies the domain name used for DNS records of Kubernetes services within the cluster. This command ensures that the CoreDNS addon is automatically deployed and properly configured to provide DNS services for the cluster, making it easier to access and manage services running in the cluster.'
