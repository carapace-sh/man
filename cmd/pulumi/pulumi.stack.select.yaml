documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pulumi stack select` command in Pulumi is used to set or get the active stack for a Pulumi project. Stacks are logical groupsing of resources and configurations that help manage deployments to different environments such as development, staging, or production. By using `stack select`, you can switch between these stacks to apply or preview changes to the desired environment. To use it, simply provide the name of the stack as an argument, for example: `pulumi stack select my-staging-stack`. If no argument is provided, it returns the currently active stack.'
