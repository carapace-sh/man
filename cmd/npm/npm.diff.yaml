documentation:
    command: '[AI] `npm diff` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn. It shows the differences between two sets of package dependencies, such as those in two different packages.json files or branches in version control. The output highlights added, removed, and modified dependencies along with their versions. This helps in understanding changes made to a project''s dependency tree.'
    flag:
        diff: '[AI] `npm diff --diff` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). This command displays the differences between two sets of package dependencies, showing additions, removals, and changes in version numbers. The `--diff` flag outputs the difference as a text-based patch file or in a human-readable format, enabling easy comparison and merging of changes to package.json files.'
        diff-dest-prefix: '[AI] `npm diff` is a command used in Node.js package management system, npm, to compare two packages or package versions and show the differences between them. The `--diff-dest-prefix` option specifies the prefix for the output file names generated by the `>` or `>>` comparison operators (`>` for forward diff and `>>` for backward diff). For example, using `npm diff package1 package2 --diff-dest-prefix="my_diff_"` will create files named "my\_diff\_forward.diff" and "my\_diff\_backward.diff" when generating the diffs.'
        diff-ignore-all-space: '[AI] `npm diff` is a command provided by nPM (Node Package Manager) to compare two sets of package dependencies and show the differences between them. The `--diff-ignore-all-space` option is used to ignore whitespace differences when displaying the comparison output. This can be helpful when you want to focus on the changes in package versions or dependencies, rather than insignificant differences in formatting or indentation.'
        diff-name-only: '[AI] `npm diff` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm to identify differences between two sets of package versions or packages lists, usually before and after a commit in version control. The `--diff-name-only` option is used to display only the names of packages that have been added, removed, or updated in the diff output. This can help quickly identify which packages have changed without having to manually inspect each line of the diff.'
        diff-no-prefix: '[AI] `npm diff` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager) to compare two sets of package dependencies and show the differences between them. The `--diff-no-prefix` option, when used with this command, prevents the output from including the prefix "+" or "-" before each added or removed dependency, respectively. In other words, it provides a more concise output by only displaying the names of the changed packages.'
        diff-src-prefix: '[AI] The `npm diff` command is a utility provided by Node Package Manager (npm) to compare two sets of package dependencies and show the differences between them. The `--diff-src-prefix` flag modifies the output format of this command by prefixing each source URL with "src:". This flag helps in quickly identifying the sources of new or updated packages when comparing different npm versions or configurations. For example, `npm diff package1 package2 --diff-src-prefix` would display differences with each source URL starting with "src:".'
        diff-text: '[AI] The `npm diff` command is a tool provided by Node Package Manager (npm) to compare two sets of package dependencies, usually before and after a package installation or update. The `--diff-text` flag is an optional argument that asks npm to output the differences in a text format instead of the default side-by-side JSON format. This can make it easier for humans to read and understand the changes.'
        diff-unified: '[AI] `npm diff` is a command provided by Node Package Manager (npm) for comparing two packages versions or two package.json files. The `--diff-unified` option generates a unified format difference output, which is a common and human-readable format for displaying differences between text files. This means that when you run `npm diff <package1> <package2> --diff-unified`, it will display the differences between the two packages in a clear and organized way, highlighting added, deleted or changed lines, making it easier to understand what has been modified.'
        global: '[AI] `npm diff --global` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). This command compares the current package dependencies in your `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file with those in a specified package version or a remote repository, and shows the differences between them. The `--global` flag indicates that the comparison should be done for global packages installed in your system rather than local project packages. This can help identify any changes to the global dependencies and assist in keeping your environment consistent.'
        tag: '[AI] The `npm diff --tag` command is a function of npm (Node Package Manager) that shows the differences between two specified versions of an npm package and its corresponding tagged labels. This can help identify what changes were made in a new version compared to the previous one, making it useful for understanding the scope and impact of updates before installing them. The `--tag` flag instructs npm to use specific tags as arguments instead of package versions.'
