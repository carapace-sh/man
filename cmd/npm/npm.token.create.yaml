documentation:
    command: '[AI] `npm token create` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager) to generate a new authentication token for securely pushing and downloading packages from the npm registry. This command creates a token with a given name and outputs it as plain text in the terminal. It''s essential for automation tools, continuous integration systems or team members collaborating on projects where access to the npm registry is required.'
    flag:
        cidr: '[AI] The `npm token create --cidr` command is used to create a new NPM authentication token with a Customized IP Address Range (CIDR) for registry access. This command generates a new token that can be used to authenticate requests to the npm registry coming from specific IP addresses or ranges defined by the CIDR notation. It helps in securing the use of npm packages within an organization by limiting the access only to trusted IPs.'
        read-only: '[AI] `npm token create --read-only` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). This command creates a new authentication token for read-only access to the npm registry. Read-only tokens have limited permissions, allowing only downloading and installing packages without the ability to publish new ones or modify existing ones. These tokens are useful when multiple team members need to access the same set of packages without having write access.'
