        [AI] The `gh label delete` command is used with the GitHub CLI (gh) to remove a label from an issue or pull request in a GitHub repository. The basic syntax is:

        ```bash
        gh label delete <label-name> <issue-number>
        ```

        Replace `<label-name>` with the name of the label you want to delete and `<issue-number>` with the number of the issue or pull request associated with the label. This command requires authentication and will remove the specified label if it exists on the given issue or pull request.
    flag:

The `--confirm` flag ensures that the user is certain they want to proceed with the label deletion and skips any additional prompts for confirmation before executing the command.'
