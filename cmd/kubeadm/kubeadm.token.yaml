documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubeadm token` is a subcommand used in Kubernetes to manage and create authentication tokens for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster. These tokens can be used to authenticate clients, such as kubelet or kubectl, with the Kubernetes API server. Tokens have an associated UID (User ID), expiration time, and role-based access control permissions. You can create a new token, print the details of existing ones, delete old tokens, or rotate them using `kubeadm token` commands.'
