documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git-svn` is a Git repository connector for Subversion (SVN) version control systems. It allows users to clone, synchronize, and work with Git while their main repository is still in SVN. With `git-svn`, you can use Git features like branches, staging areas, and merging, but changes are pushed back to the SVN server using standard SVN commit messages. Essentially, it''s a bidirectional bridge that helps manage Subversion repositories with Git workflows.'
