    command: '[AI] `apt-get update` is a command used in Debian-based Linux distributions to update the package index files from the repositories added in the system. It retrieves and saves the latest metadata about the available packages, including their versions and dependencies. After running this command, other commands like `apt-get install` or `apt-get upgrade` can effectively download and install the newest packages based on the updated index files.'
