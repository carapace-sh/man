documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `flatpak repair` command is used to check and fix issues with installed Flatpak applications on a Linux system. It scans the installed Flatpaks for inconsistencies or errors, and if any are found, it attempts to repair them by redownloading and reinstalling the problematic components. If the issue cannot be resolved, the command may suggest removing and reinstalling the affected application instead. The ultimate goal of `flatpak repair` is to ensure that installed Flatpaks function correctly and efficiently on your system.'
    flag:
        dry-run: '[AI] `flatpak repair --dry-run` is a command used in the Flatpak software deployment system. It performs a dry run of the `repair` operation, which checks for issues with installed Flatpaks and their dependencies without actually making any changes. This can help users identify potential problems before executing the repair command in a production environment. The output shows details about the suggested repairs, but no actions are taken unless explicitly instructed to do so with the `--apply-repairs` flag.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `flatpak repair` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux platforms. The `--help` option is used to display detailed help information about the `repair` subcommand. Here's a brief explanation:

            `flatpak repair [OPTIONS] [PACKAGE]...`

            The `repair` command aims to resolve issues with installed Flatpak packages by performing various actions, such as:

            1. Reinstalling corrupted or broken packages.
            2. Repairing damaged metadata.
            3. Cleaning up unnecessary files and caches.

            The optional `[PACKAGE]...` arguments can be used to repair specific packages rather than all of them.

            To see a comprehensive list of available options, use the following command:

            `flatpak repair --help`

            This will display detailed information about each option and their respective usage. Commonly used options include `--no-uninstall`, which prevents uninstallation of packages during repair, and `--verbose`, which increases the output level for more detailed progress updates.
        installation: '[AI] `flatpak repair --installation` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system for Linux desktops. This command scans your system for any potential issues with installed Flatpaks (self-contained applications) and repairs them by reinstalling the problematic packages from their original remote or local sources. The `--installation` flag specifically instructs the tool to focus on repairing installation-related issues, ensuring that the application environments remain functional and up-to-date.'
        ostree-verbose: |-
            [AI] `flatpak repair` is a command from the Flatpak package manager for Linux systems, used to fix issues with installed applications. The `--ostree-verbose` option is an argument provided along with this command to increase the level of detail in the output during the repair process.

            When you run `flatpak repair --ostree-verbose`, it performs a more thorough inspection and repair of the OSTree filesystems (a specific storage technology used by Flatpak). The verbose flag makes Flatpak print out detailed information about the filesystem operations it's performing during the repair, such as identifying and attempting to fix any inconsistencies or corruption within the OSTree snapshots. This additional detail can help system administrators or developers troubleshoot any potential problems with Flatpak installations.
        reinstall-all: '[AI] `flatpak repair --reinstall-all` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager for Linux systems. The command triggers a repair process where all installed Flatpak applications have their installed files replaced with new ones from the remote repositories. This can be helpful when dealing with corrupted or outdated installation states, as it allows users to restore their applications back to their original, functional state without having to manually uninstall and reinstall each one individually.'
        system: '[AI] `flatpak repair --system` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system for Linux distributions. This command scans and repairs issues within the installed Flatpak applications and their runtimes at the system level. It checks for missing or corrupted components, fixes permissions, and synchronizes metadata with the remote repositories to maintain a healthy and functional Flatpak environment.'
        user: '[AI] `flatpak repair --user` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager for Linux systems. It scans and repairs any issues with the installed Flatpak applications for a specific user. The command checks for corrupted application data, such as damaged metadata or files, and attempts to fix them by redownloading or reinstalling the affected packages. This helps maintain a healthy Flatpak installation for that particular user account.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] `flatpak repair` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system. The `--verbose` option is used to increase the amount of output displayed during the repair process.

            When you run `flatpak repair --verbose`, it will scan your Flatpak installation for any corrupt or inconsistent data. If any issues are found, it will provide detailed information about the problem and suggested actions to fix it. The verbose output includes progress updates, error messages, and debugging information, helping you better understand the state of your Flatpak installation and the repairs being performed.
