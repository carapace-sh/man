documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `jj unsquash` command is used in the Juju deployment orchestration tool for Charms. It''s specifically designed to undo the effects of the `juju squash` command, which was used to merge all units within a charm into a single unit. By using `jj unsquash`, Juju will split the merged units back into their individual units, allowing independent management and scaling of each one again.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] The command `jj unsquash --help` is used with the Juju deployment tool to display help information about the `unsquash` sub-command. This sub-command is responsible for extracting the files from a squashed bundle, which is a compressed bundle of configuration and application code in Juju. By running this command with the `--help` flag, users can quickly access detailed information on how to use the `unsquash` command, including its syntax, available options, and their functions.'
        interactive: '[AI] `jj unsquash --interactive` is a command used in the Jupyter Notebook environment for interactively applying changes made in a Jupyter diff or patch file (created using `jj squash`). The `unsquash` command extracts the changes from the file, and the `--interactive` option allows the user to review and confirm each hunk of changes before they are applied to the notebook. This is useful for ensuring that the intended modifications are being made before they take effect.'
        revision: '[AI] `jj unsquash` is a command from the Mercurial version control system. The `--revision` option specifies a particular revision or changeset to extract from the Mercurian repository, and the `unsquash` subcommand extracts the files at that revision into a new directory, preserving their original file paths and directory structure. In summary, it extracts a specific revision as a standalone directory.'
