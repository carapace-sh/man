        [AI] The `tmux respawn-pane` is a TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) command used to automatically restart the command running in a specific pane when it exits unexpectedly. This can be helpful for keeping processes running in the background, especially in cases where they may terminate due to network interruptions or other unforeseen circumstances.

        The basic syntax of this command is `tmux send-keys -Rt <pane_number> "\bp; respawn-pane; enter"`, where `<pane_number>` refers to the number or identifier of the pane you want to configure. This command sends a keystroke sequence to TMUX, telling it to move the cursor to the previous pane (using `\bp`), send the `respawn-pane` command (which restarts the pane's process), and then press enter key to execute the command.

        In summary, the "tmux respawn-pane" command helps you keep processes running in specific TMUX panes even if they unexpectedly exit. This can be useful for managing background tasks and maintaining a productive workflow in your terminal sessions.
    flag:
        c: '[AI] The `tmux` command `respawn-pane -c` is used to automatically restart a pane in a Tmux session when it exits due to a signal or an error. The `-c` option specifies the command to run in the pane after the process has been restarted. This can be useful for keeping processes running continuously within a Tmux session, such as in development environments where long-running processes might be terminated unexpectedly.'
        e: '[AI] `tmux respawn-pane` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to automatically restart a pane or session that has exited unexpectedly. The `-e` option specifies the command to execute in the newly spawned pane. So, `tmux respawn-pane -e <command>` will not only restart the pane but also run the given `<command>` inside it. For instance, if you have a script or process that keeps crashing and you want it to be automatically started whenever the pane is respawned, use this command: `tmux resume-pane -K -t <session>:<window>.<pane> && tmux send-keys -t <session>:<window>.<pane> "sh <script>.sh" <Enter> && tmux respawn-pane -e "sh <script>.sh" <session>:<window>.<pane>`.'
        k: '[AI] `tmux respawn-pane -k` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to automatically restart a pane or session when it exits unexpectedly. The `respawn-pane` subcommand tells Tmux to manage the pane, while the `-k` option specifies that this pane should be kept alive and automatically restarted if it terminates. This can be useful for managing long-running processes or tasks where crashes or errors are common.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux respawn-pane` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer that forces the specified pane to be recreated with its previous commands and settings, if it exists. The `-t` option specifies the target pane identifier. For example, `tmux respawn-pane -t 0.0` would refer to the first pane in the first window of the current TMUX session. This command is useful when a process running in a pane has crashed and you want it to automatically restart with the same settings when a new instance is started.'
