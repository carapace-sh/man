    command: '[AI] `pamac info` is a command used in the Pacman Account Management (PAM) package manager for Arch Linux.

            [AI] `pamac info --aur` is a command used in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux. The `--aur` option stands for "Arch User Repository," which refers to the unofficial package repository containing additional software packages not included in the official Arch repositories.

            The `pamac info` command retrieves information about an AUR package, displaying details such as its name, version number, description, dependencies, and other relevant data. This can help users determine if they want to install a particular package, and what other packages may be required for it to run correctly.
        no-aur: '[AI] The command `pamac info --no-aur` in Arch Linux is used to display detailed information about installed packages managed by Pamac (Arch Linux Package Manager). The `--no-aur` option is used to exclude the information about AUR (Arch User Repository) packages, which are packages not available in the official Arch Linux repositories and need to be built or downloaded manually. So, this command will only show information about packages installed from the official repositories.'
