documentation:
    command: '[AI] `unzip` is a command-line utility in various Unix-based operating systems for extracting files from ZIP archives. The basic syntax is: `unzip <archive_name>.zip`. When executed, `unzip` will extract all the files and directories within the archive to the current directory. You can also use options such as `-d <extract_to_directory>` to specify a different extraction location.'
    flag:
        C: '[AI] The `-C` option used with the `unzip` command in Unix-based systems is used to extract the contents of a zip file into the current directory, creating the necessary subdirectories if needed and placing each extracted file or folder in its correct location based on their hierarchical structure within the zip file. This command does not change the working directory but displays the extracted files and directories on the terminal screen for easy reference.'
        K: '[AI] The `-K` option used with the `unzip` command in Unix-based systems is used to extract files from a zip archive and preserve the original directory structure. When this option is specified, the extracted files will be placed in a new subdirectory with the same name as the original archive. This can be useful when dealing with large or complex archives where preserving the original folder structure is important.'
        L: '[AI] The `-L` option used with the `unzip` command in Unix-based systems lists out the names of all files that would be extracted if the zip archive were to be unzipped, without actually extracting the files themselves. It provides a quick way to view the contents of a zip file without having to extract and navigate through the directory structure.'
        M: '[AI] The `-M` option used with the `unzip` command in Unix-based systems checks the integrity of an extracted zip file against its original MD5 message verification value. If the MD5 checksum matches, the extraction is considered successful and safe. It''s a security feature that helps ensure data authenticity when extracting files from a potentially compromised or untrusted source.'
        T: '[AI] The `-T` option in the `unzip` command is used to test the integrity of an encrypted ZIP archive without extracting its contents. It verifies the digital signature or checksum of each file in the archive against the values stored in the archive''s central directory, ensuring the archive has not been tampered with during transfer or storage. This helps maintain data security and authenticity.'
        U: '[AI] The `-U` option in the `unzip` command is used to extract all files from a ZIP archive without keeping the original folder structure of the archive. In other words, it extracts all files at the current directory level and overwrites any existing files with the same name. This can be useful when you want to extract files individually from an archive instead of restoring the entire folder hierarchy.'
        V: '[AI] `unzip` is a command-line utility used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems for extracting files from zip archives. The option `-V` is used to verify the integrity of a zip archive before extracting its contents. This means that the flag checks if the archive''s digital signature or checksum matches the original data, ensuring that the file has not been tampered with during transfer or storage. If the verification succeeds, the extraction process continues; otherwise, an error message is displayed.'
        X: '[AI] The `-X` option in the `unzip` command is used to extract all files from an zip archive, excluding empty directories. This means that only the files will be extracted and not any empty or unused directories within the archive.'
        Z: '[AI] The `-Z` option in the `unzip` command is used to verify the digital signatures of the files inside a zip archive before extracting them. This ensures that the files have not been tampered with during transfer or storage, adding an extra layer of security. If the signature check fails, the extraction process will not continue.'
        a: '[AI] The command `unzip -a` is used in Unix-based systems to extract all the files from a zip archive, while preserving their original directory structure. The `-a` option stands for "extract and apply permissions," meaning that the file permissions from the archive are applied to the extracted files. This command is useful when you want to extract an archive and maintain its original directory organization and file properties.'
        d: '[AI] The `unzip` command is a utility in Unix-based systems used for extracting files from ZIP archives. The option `-d` tells `unzip` to extract the files to a specified directory (if given) or, if no directory is specified, to the current directory, with each file being extracted into its own subdirectory that bears the name of the original ZIP file. This helps keep the extracted files organized within the same folder structure as the original archive.'
        f: '[AI] The `unzip` command with the `-f` option is used in Unix-based systems for extracting files from a ZIP archive without raising any extraction errors, even if an extractee file with the same name already exists in the destination directory. By default, `unzip` would raise an error and refuse to overwrite existing files. With the `-f` option, it forces extraction regardless.'
        j: '[AI] The `-j` option used with the `unzip` command in Unix-based systems is used to extract individual files from an zip archive directly into their intended directories, without creating a new subdirectory for the archive name. In other words, it extracts files "in place" rather than extracting them into an explicit directory.'
        l: '[AI] The command `unzip -l` is used with the Unix archive utility, `unzip`. This command option is used to list the contents of a zip archive without actually extracting the files. It provides detailed information about each file in the archive such as the name, size, and modification date.'
        "n": '[AI] The `unzip` command in Unix-based systems is used to extract files from a zip archive. The option `-n` is used with this command for renaming the extracted files based on the names given in the archive, without appending any suffixes such as "_extracted" or "_" followed by a sequence number. So, if you have an archive with multiple files and want to extract them while preserving their original names, use `unzip -n <archive_name>`.'
        o: '[AI] The `unzip` command is a utility in Unix-based systems used for extracting files from zip archives. The option `-o` tells `unzip` to overwrite existing files without asking for confirmation when extracting the contents of the archive. This can be useful when you are certain that you want to replace any existing files with the ones in the archive.'
        p: '[AI] The command `unzip -p` in Unix-based systems is used to extract individual files from a zip archive, printing them directly to standard output stream without saving them to disk. This means that you can view or process the file content in real-time, without creating an extra file on your local system. For instance, you can pipe the output to other commands like `less`, `grep`, or `sed` for further processing.'
        q: '[AI] The `unzip` command in Unix-based systems is used to extract files from a ZIP archive. The option `-q` is quiet mode, which means that unzip will extract files without any messages being displayed other than errors. Essentially, it runs the extraction process in the background and suppresses all informational messages.'
        t: '[AI] The `unzip` command in Unix-based systems has an option called `-t`, which is used to test the integrity of a zip archive without extracting its contents. This is done by verifying the checksums of each file inside the archive against their counterparts from the original source. If the verification passes, it indicates that the archive has not been tampered with during transfer or storage.'
        u: '[AI] The `unzip` command is a utility in Unix-based systems used for extracting files from zip archives. The option `-u` (capital U, not lowercase l as in `-l` which lists the contents of an archive) tells `unzip` to update files that already exist but keep their current permissions, timestamps, and other attributes during the extraction process. If used with the `-d` option to specify an output directory, new files will be extracted there while existing ones are updated in place.'
        v: '[AI] The `unzip` command in Unix-based systems is used to extract files from a ZIP archive. The option `-v` (lowercase "v") stands for "verbose." When used with `unzip`, it provides detailed information about the extraction process, including the names of each file as they are extracted and any relevant progress messages. Essentially, it increases the level of output during the extraction process to help users monitor the progress more closely.'
        x: '[AI] The command `unzip -x` is used in Unix-based operating systems to extract specific files from a zip archive without extracting the entire archive. The "-x" option specifies that only the named files should be extracted. For example, if you have a zip file named "myarchive.zip" with multiple files inside and you want to extract only the files named "file1.txt" and "file2.png", you would use the command `unzip myarchive.zip -x file1.txt file2.png`.'
        z: '[AI] The `-z` option in the `unzip` command is used to verify the integrity of an extracted zip file by checking its size and CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) against the original archive. It does not actually extract the files, but only displays the comparison results. This can be useful for ensuring that the downloaded or transferred file has not been corrupted during transfer.'
