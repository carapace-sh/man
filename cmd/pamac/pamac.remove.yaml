documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pamac remove` is a command used in the Pacman Advanced Client (PAMAC) package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. It''s employed to delete or uninstall packages from your system. When you run this command followed by the name of the package, PAMAC will remove it along with all its dependent packages that are no longer needed. This command simplifies the process of removing packages compared to using Pacman directly and can handle dependencies more gracefully.'
    flag:
        dry-run: '[AI] `pamac` is a package manager for Arch Linux and its variants, such as Antergos and Manjaro. The command `pamac remove --dry-run <package>` is used to simulate the removal of a specific package without actually executing the action. The `--dry-run` option displays what would be done if the command were run without `--dry-run`. This allows users to see the impact of their actions before committing to the actual removal, which can help prevent accidental deletion of important packages or dependencies.'
        no-confirm: '[AI] `pacman` is a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives, including removing packages with the command `pacman -R`. The `--no-confirm` option is used to bypass the confirmation prompt before removal, allowing for automatic or unattended operations. The `pamac remove --no-confirm` command specifically refers to using the Pacman Archive Manager CLI (PAMC) with this configuration for package removal without user intervention.'
        no-orphans: '[AI] `pamac` is a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. The command `pamac remove --no-orphans <package>` instructs it to remove the specified package and all of its dependencies that have no other packages depending on them. The `--no-orphans` flag ensures that only the selected package and its non-essential dependencies get removed, avoiding the risk of unintended dependency conflicts or system instability.'
        no-save: '[AI] The `pacman` command with the option `--remove` followed by `--no-save` is used to remove a installed package in Arch Linux or its derivatives without leaving any record of the removal in the system''s package database (also known as the Pacman database). This means that after running this command, the package will no longer be listed as installed and can''t be easily reinstalled using standard package management tools. The `--no-save` flag ensures that the database is not updated with the removal information.'
        orphans: '[AI] `pamac` is a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. The command `pamac remove --orphans` is used to remove orphaned packages. Orphaned packages are those that no longer have any dependencies, meaning they can be safely removed without affecting the system. This command helps in keeping the system lightweight by removing such unnecessary packages.'
        unneeded: '[AI] `pamac` is a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. The command `pamac remove --unneeded` is used to remove packages that are no longer needed based on the current system configuration. This command scans the installed packages, their dependencies, and the files in the file system to determine which packages can safely be removed without affecting the system''s functionality. It can help keep the system lean and reduce disk space usage.'
