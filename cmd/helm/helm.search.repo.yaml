flags:
    --devel: use development versions (alpha, beta, and release candidate releases), too. Equivalent to version '>0.0.0-0'. If --version is set, this is ignored
    --max-col-width=: maximum column width for output table
    --version=: search using semantic versioning constraints on repositories you have added
    -l, --versions: show the long listing, with each version of each chart on its own line, for repositories you have added
    -o, --output=: 'prints the output in the specified format. Allowed values: table, json, yaml'
    -r, --regexp: use regular expressions for searching repositories you have added
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `helm search repo` command is used with Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to search for available repositories in your Helm repositories list. It takes no arguments and returns a list of repository names along with the number of charts each repository contains. This command helps you discover new chart repositories to expand your Helm chart library.'
    flag:
        devel: '[AI] `helm search repo --devel` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to find Git repositories that contain Helm charts in their development or pre-release stages. The "--devel" flag filters the search results to show only those repositories that have charts under active development. This command helps users discover and experiment with new or cutting-edge chart versions before they are officially released.'
        max-col-width: '[AI] `helm search repo` is a Helm command used to search for available repositories in your Helm repositories configuration. The `--max-col-width` option sets the maximum width of columns in the output. This can be useful if you have a narrow terminal window and want to ensure that the output fits without being truncated.'
        output: '[AI] `helm search repo` is a Helm command used to search for available Helm repositories, specifically those that contain charts. The `--output` option modifies the output format of the command. By default, it displays the repository name and URL in a table. However, with `--output json`, it returns the results as a JSON object containing each repository''s name and URL.'
        regexp: '[AI] `helm search repo` is a Helm command used to search for charts in various repositories. The `--regexp` option refines the search by using a regular expression pattern instead of an exact match when filtering the chart names. For example, `helm search repo my-regexp` would return all charts with names that match the given regexp pattern. This can be useful when dealing with a large number of repositories and wanting to find specific charts based on patterns in their names.'
        version: |-
            [AI] The `helm search repo --version` command is used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager, to search for repositories and retrieve their version information. It's typically run from the command line in a terminal or terminal-like environment. Here's a breakdown of the flags:

            * `helm`: Invokes the Helm client tool.
            * `search`: Instructs Helm to perform a repository search.
            * `repo`: Tells Helm to search for repositories specifically.
            * `--version`: Requests that the output include each repository's version number.
        versions: '[AI] `helm search repo --versions` is a Helm command used to search for available versions of Helm charts in the official and custom repositories. The `repo` argument specifies the location of the repositories, and the `--versions` option displays the chart versions along with their respective repository URLs. It helps in finding the most recent or specific version of a chart before installing it using Helm.'
