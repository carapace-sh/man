documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git submodule status` is a Git command used to display the current state of all submodules in your Git repository. It shows for each submodule, its local master branch name, the URL of the remote branch it''s currently tracking, and whether or not any changes have been made to the submodule itself or its commit ID within the parent repository.'
    flag:
        cached: '[AI] `git submodule status --cached` is a Git command that displays the current state of all configured submodules in the .gitmodules file, specifically their cached state. It lists each submodule with its name, location, and whether or not it has been modified but not yet committed (unmerged) or matches the HEAD commit in the superproject repository. The "--cached" option shows the state of the submodules based on the next commit message rather than their current working directory.'
        recursive: '[AI] `git submodule status --recursive` is a Git command used to display the status of all submodules and their associated repositories, including those nested within subdirectories at any depth. The `--recursive` option ensures that the status information is retrieved for all submodules, regardless of their nesting level in the project directory structure. This command can be useful when working with projects that have multiple levels of submodules and when making updates or checking for changes within those repositories.'
