documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vercel certs` is a command used in the Vercel platform for managing SSL/TLS certificates. It allows users to list, create, delete, and view details of SSL certificates associated with their Vercel projects or domains. The command interacts with Vercel''s API, making it a convenient tool for managing certificates from the command line.'
    flag:
        ca: '[AI] `vercel certs --ca` is a command provided by Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, to manage SSL/TLS certificates. The `--ca` option specifically refers to the CA (Certificate Authority) bundle. When you use this command with an argument that is the path to a CA certificate file, it adds the CA to your project''s trust list, enabling Vercel to recognize the CA and issue certificates signed by it. This is useful when using custom or self-signed certificates.'
        challenge-only: '[AI] `vercel certs --challenge-only` is a command used in Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. This command generates challenge certificates for SSL/TLS certification authorities. In other words, it provides cryptographic proof that the website''s content has not been tampered with since the certificate was issued. The `--challenge-only` option specifies that only challenge certificates will be generated and not a full certificate, which is useful during the initial setup or troubleshooting of SSL configurations.'
        crt: '[AI] `vercel certs --crt` is a command used in Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, to manage SSL/TLS certificates. The `--crt` option specifically refers to the process of generating or downloading the certificate files (the .pem or .crt files) associated with an SSL/TLS certificate for a project deployed on Vercel. These certificate files are essential for establishing secure HTTPS connections between the client and server. When you run `vercel certs --crt`, it will either create new certificate files if they don''t exist or download the existing ones to your local machine, depending on your use case.'
        key: '[AI] `vercel certs --key` is a command provided by Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, to manage SSL/TLS certificates. The `--key` option is used to specify the private key file path when creating or updating an SSL certificate. By providing this key, Vercel can issue a corresponding public certificate and set it up for your domain in their CDN and edge network. This command helps ensure secure HTTPS communication between your website and its visitors.'
        next: '[AI] `vercel certs --next` is a command used in Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, to manage SSL/TLS certificates. The `--next` option indicates that the next certificate in the queue should be processed. This command is typically used when you have multiple certificates waiting for approval or processing and you want to expedite the process for the next one.'
