documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea pulls reject` command is used in the Tectonic container orchestration platform to reject a specific pull request for an image in a Tectonic registry. When a new image is pushed to a Tectonic registry, it may need to be reviewed and approved before being deployed. This command allows an administrator to reject a pull request, preventing the image from being pulled and deployed.'
    flag:
        login: |-
            [AI] The command `tea pulls reject --login` is used with the TEA (Traffic Engineering Automator) tool, which is a CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool for managing traffic engineering policies in networking devices such as routers and switches.

            This specific command is used to reject incoming SSH connections to the device, essentially denying login access for users trying to connect from outside the local network. The `--login` option specifies that this action should only apply to interactive login sessions and not affect other types of SSH connections, such as automated scripts or configuration updates.

            By using this command, you can secure your networking devices by restricting access to their management interfaces and preventing unauthorized users from gaining control over the device.
        output: '[AI] The command `tea pull reject --output` is used with the Tectonic (now Docker Enterprise Edition) container management platform. It rejects and lists the rejected tea (Tectonic Engine Applications) pulled from a remote repository, displaying the rejection reasons in the output format specified by the user. This command helps in managing and maintaining the desired state of your applications on your Tectonic cluster.'
        remote: |-
            [AI] The command `git pull --rebase origin master --reject-without-note teapot` is used in Git version control system to perform a fetch and rebase of changes from a remote repository (in this case, named "origin") onto the current local branch (usually named "master"), but with some specific options:

            1. `--rebase`: Instead of merging the remote branches onto the current one using fast-forward or three-way merge, this option performs a rebase of the current branch on top of the remote one.
            2. `origin master`: Specifies the remote repository and the branch to fetch and rebase from/onto, respectively.
            3. `--reject-without-note teapot`: This option instructs Git not to automatically fail a pull request when there are non-fast-forward conflicts (i.e., changes in both the local and remote branches) but instead creates unmerged files with the suffix `.ours` (from the local changes) and `.theirs` (from the remote changes). The `teapot` argument is a symbolic name for this special branch that Git will create when handling such conflicts.
            4. In summary, this command is used to perform a rebase of the current branch on top of the latest changes from a remote repository and allow for manual resolution of any non-fast-forward conflicts.
        repo: '[AI] The command `git pull --rebase origin master --reject-upstream teapot` sets up a local branch, called "teapot," to track the remote branch named "master" on the repository referred to as "origin." When performing a pull request using this command, any local commits that cannot be fast-forwarded during the rebase process will be automatically stashed and saved with the label "reject." This allows you to review and apply those changes manually before resolving potential merge conflicts.'
