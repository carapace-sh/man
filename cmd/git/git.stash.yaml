documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git stash` is a Git command used to save your current changes in a stack, allowing you to easily switch to a different branch or commit without losing your work. The command temporarily stores the changes in a stash, which can be later applied back using `git stash apply`. This is particularly useful when you have made modifications that you''re not ready to commit but want to work on something else in the meantime.'
