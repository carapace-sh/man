        [AI] `terragrunt aws-provider-patch` is a command used with Terraform's Terragrunt tool for managing multiple Terraform modules or workspaces within a single Terragrunt project. This specific command is designed to patch AWS provider configuration, typically when Amazon Web Services (AWS) updates its provider version, and you need to update your Terraform code accordingly but keep the existing state file.

        By using `terragrunt aws-provider-patch`, you don't have to manually change the Terraform configurations or even reapply your entire Terraform configuration; instead, you can patch just the AWS provider configuration. The command identifies and applies the required modifications based on the new provider version.

        After running the command, Terragrunt will update the `terragrunt.hcl` file with any necessary changes to the AWS provider configuration in your Terraform files. Then, you can simply run `terragrunt apply` or `terragrunt plan` to use the updated provider configuration with the existing state file.
