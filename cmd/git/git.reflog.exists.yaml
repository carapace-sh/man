description: Check whether a ref has a reflog
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command `git reflog exists <commit-hash>` checks if there are any refs (pointers to commits) in the Git reflog that refer to the specified commit hash. If a ref exists, the command will return some output indicating the existence and the branch or tag name where the commit can be found. If no such ref exists, the command will return an empty output or a message indicating "no matching refs in reflog".'
