description: Generate certificate keys
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm certs certificate-key` command is used to generate a new private key for the certificate signing request (CSR) used by Kubernetes components such as etcd, kube-apiserver, and kubelet, among others. This command is typically run during the initial setup of a Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm init` or when renewing existing certificates that are near their expiration date. The generated key is saved in a file specified by the user, which can then be used to create a new certificate using tools like OpenSSL or `kubeadm`.'
