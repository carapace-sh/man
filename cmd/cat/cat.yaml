documentation:
    command: '[AI] `cat` is a common Unix utility used to display the content of files on the terminal. It stands for Concatenate and Originally was designed to concatenate multiple files, but nowadays it''s more commonly used to quickly view file contents. When you type `cat filename`, the command reads the specified file and displays its content line by line. Additionally, it offers options like `-n` (for numbering lines), `-b` (for displaying byte offsets), or `-e` (for showing invisible characters like newline and tab).'
    flag:
        e: '[AI] The `cat` command with the option `-e` in Unix or Linux systems is used to display the contents of a file on the terminal with some visual cues. Specifically, it adds a $ sign at the end of each line and displays ^ character for any non-printing characters (such as tabs or newline characters) in the file, making it easier to identify these invisible characters when editing.'
        help: '[AI] The `--help` option when used with the `cat` command in Unix or Linux environments displays a brief help message about what the `cat` command does and the various options that can be used with it. This helps users understand how to use the command effectively. The message typically includes a short description of the command, a list of available options, and their corresponding usage.'
        number: '[AI] The `cat --number` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems, used for concatenating and displaying files on the terminal. With the `--number` option, it adds line numbers before each line of text when outputting file content. This can help with navigation, tracking changes, or debugging during manual file review.'
        number-nonblank: '[AI] The `cat` command with the `--number-nonblank` option is used to display the entire contents of files, including blank lines, but with non-blank lines numbered for easier reference and review. Each line number is prefixed to the corresponding line content in the output.'
        show-all: '[AI] The `cat --show-all` command in Unix or Linux is used to display the contents of a file in its entirety, including invisible characters such as tabs and line breaks. The `--show-all` option (or just `-A`) ensures that all data, not just text, is displayed. This can be helpful for debugging files with formatting issues or binary data.'
        show-ends: '[AI] The `cat` command with the option `--show-ends` is used to display text files on the terminal with a visual indication of the end-of-line character(s). By default, Unix-based systems use LF (Line Feed) characters as end-of-line markers. However, some text files might have CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed) sequences or other non-standard line ending characters, causing inconsistencies when editing or comparing files. The `--show-ends` flag helps to identify such discrepancies by appending a `^M` character (representing CR) at the end of lines with CRLF sequence or any other visible symbol representing other non-LF line ending characters.'
        show-nonprinting: '[AI] The `cat --show-nonprinting` command is a feature of the `cat` utility in Unix and Linux systems. It is used to display all characters including non-printable ones (like tabs, newlines, and form feeds) with appropriate symbols when viewed on the terminal. By default, `cat` command only displays printable ASCII characters. This option helps in debugging files with unexpected formatting or for better understanding of file content especially in text editing and scripting contexts.'
        show-tabs: '[AI] `cat` is a common command-line utility in Unix-based systems for viewing the contents of files. The option `--show-tabs` is not a built-in flag for `cat`, but it''s a feature provided by some terminal emulators, like `screen` or `tmux`. This feature displays horizontal tab characters as ''\<TAB>'' sequences in the output instead of expanding them to spaces. So, using `cat --show-tabs` would mean running `cat` with no special flags but viewing the output in a terminal that supports this feature to keep tabs as they are represented by ''\<TAB>''.'
        squeeze-blank: '[AI] The `cat --squeeze-blank` command in Unix or Linux is used to print the content of files to the standard output (usually the terminal), while removing consecutive blank lines. This results in less clutter and makes it easier to read through long files with minimal blank spaces.'
        t: '[AI] The `cat` command with the option `-t` in Unix or Linux environments is used to display files on the terminal with invisible characters, such as tabs and line feeds, represented by ^I and ^M respectively. It does not change the file itself but only affects how it''s displayed when piped or redirected for output.'
        u: '[AI] The `cat` command with the `-u` option is used to display the contents of a file on the terminal, with the ability to show unfilled final lines and mark characters that have been added or deleted. This is often referred to as "unified diff" mode, which makes it useful for comparing and merging text files or tracking changes between different versions.'
        version: '[AI] The `cat --version` command is used in Unix-based operating systems to display the version information of the `cat` utility installed on the system. The `--version` option is a flag provided with this command, which when invoked, returns the name of the `cat` utility and its corresponding version number, often in the format "cat (UTC-time)". This helps users to determine if their installation is up-to-date or not, allowing them to install updates if needed.'
