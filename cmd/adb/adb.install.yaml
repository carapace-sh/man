    command: '[AI] `adb install` is a command-line tool used in Android development for installing an APK (Android Package Kit) file on an Android device connected to a computer via USB. The syntax is `adb install <path_to_apk_file>`. It copies the APK to the device, verifies the APK signature for security, and then installs it. This command can also be used with a local or remote file using the `-t` flag for testing or staging installation instead of full deployment.'
    flag:
        d: '[AI] `adb install -d` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) tool for installing an APK (Android Application Package) on a connected Android device in "debug mode." The `-d` flag stands for "device" and specifies that the installation should be done on a specific device rather than an emulator. This command overwrites any existing app with the same package name on the device, making it suitable for sideloading app updates or installing apps from sources outside of Google Play Store.'
        g: '[AI] The `adb install -g` command is used in Android Debug Bridge (adb) to install an application package file (-p or -t option followed by the path to the apk file) globally on all user profiles of an Android device. The `-g` flag ensures that the app will be accessible to all users on the device, including those created outside of the system default profile. This command is particularly useful when installing enterprise or multi-user apps for organizations where multiple users need access to a single application instance.'
        instant: '[AI] The `adb install --instant` command is a feature of Android Debug Bridge (adb) that allows for fast installation of an APK (Android Application Package) file onto an Android device without performing a full verification process. This can save time during development and testing, especially when installing multiple APKs. However, it''s important to note that using `--instant` may bypass some security checks, potentially allowing the installation of malicious apps. Always ensure you only install trusted software onto your devices.'
        l: '[AI] `adb install -l` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB), a versatile command-line tool that allows communication between an Android device and a computer. This specific command installs an APK (Android Application Package) file on the device, with the additional flag `-l` (long listing) included for providing detailed information about the installation process. The output includes the name of the application being installed, its size, the install location, and other related details.'
        r: '[AI] `adb install -r` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for installing an APK or application package file recursively on an Android device. The `-r` option indicates that the installation should be done in replace mode, meaning it will overwrite any existing instance of the app with the same package name without asking for confirmation. This command is useful when deploying new versions of apps to multiple devices and wanting to ensure that old versions are replaced.'
        s: '[AI] `adb install -s` is a command used with Android Debug Bridge (adb), which is a versatile tool that allows developers to communicate with an Android device. The `install` sub-command is used to install an APK file on the device. The `-s` option specifies the device serial number or its alias, making it possible to target a specific device during installation. This command line helps in sideloading apps onto an Android device using adb.'
        t: '[AI] `adb install -t` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (adb) to install an APK file as a test application. The "-t" option signifies that the app will be installed in test mode, which allows running automated tests using testing frameworks such as JUnit and Robolectric. This is particularly useful during software development for unit testing and UI testing of Android apps.'
