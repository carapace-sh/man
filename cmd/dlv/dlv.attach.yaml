documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dlv attach` is a debugger command in the D Language''s DEBugeR (dlv) tool. It attaches the debugger to an already running target process, allowing you to inspect its state, control its execution, and set breakpoints dynamically without requiring a precompiled debug information or rebuilding the application. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with large systems or processes where attaching the debugger during startup is impractical or impossible.'
    flag:
        continue: '[AI] `dlv attach --continue` is a command used in Delve debugger (short for "Dive"), a popular Go programming language debugger. This command is used to attach the Delve debugger to an already running Go process, continuing execution from the last stop or breakpoint. Once attached, you can use various debugging features of Delve such as inspecting variables, stepping through code, and setting breakpoints.'
