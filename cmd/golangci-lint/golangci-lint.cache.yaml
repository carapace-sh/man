    command: '[AI] `golangci-lint cache` is a Golang static code analysis tool command used to manage and update the local cache of analyzed Go modules. It helps speed up subsequent analyses by reusing the results from previous scans, improving overall performance. The cache is automatically maintained when you run other Golangci Lint commands, but you can manually clear or update it using this specific command if needed.'
