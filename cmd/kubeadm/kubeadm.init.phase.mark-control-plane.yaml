description: Mark a node as a control-plane
flags:
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --node-name=: Specify the node name.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm init phase mark-control-plane` is a command used in Kubernetes to mark the control-plane nodes, which are the nodes responsible for managing the cluster as a whole, as ready in the Kubeadm init process. This command is typically run after initializing and joining a new node to a Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm init` command. It sets the control-plane role on the marked nodes, allowing them to become part of the Kubernetes control plane.'
    flag:
        config: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool for setting up a Kubernetes control plane cluster. The `phase mark-control-plane --config` argument is used during the initial setup of a Kubernetes cluster to mark the master node(s) as control planes. This is done by updating the configuration file provided in the argument, so that these nodes are identified as control plane nodes within the cluster. Once this phase is completed, additional worker nodes can be joined to the cluster using `kubeadm join`.'
        node-name: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase mark-control-plane --node-name` argument is a subcommand that marks the specified node as part of the control plane in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. This means that the node will host and manage the cluster''s master components, such as etcd, kube-apiserver, and kube-controller-manager. By running this command on a node, you are effectively designating it as the control plane node in your cluster.'
