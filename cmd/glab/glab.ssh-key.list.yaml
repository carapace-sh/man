    command: '[AI] The `glab ssh-key list` command is used in GitLab to display a list of SSH keys registered under your GitLab account. It helps you manage and keep track of the SSH keys associated with your account, ensuring secure access to your GitLab projects.'
    flag:
        page: '[AI] `glab ssh-key list --page` is a command used in the GitLab CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. This command lists all the SSH keys that have been registered with your GitLab account. The `--page` option is used for paginated output, meaning it will display one page of results at a time and allow you to navigate through multiple pages using arrow keys or other pagination commands in your terminal.'
        per-page: '[AI] `glab` is a Git interface tool for `git-crypt` and `ssh-agent`, developed by the GitHub team. The command `glab ssh-key list --per-page <number>` lists the SSH keys managed by `glab`. The option `--per-page <number>` sets the number of items to be displayed per page. This allows you to control the amount of output when dealing with a large number of keys, making it easier for you to manage and navigate through your list of SSH keys.'
        show-id: '[AI] `glab` is a Git interface tool from GitLab, and `ssh-key list` is one of its subcommands used to list the SSH keys registered with your GitLab account. The option `--show-id` is used to display only the ID (fingerprint) of each registered SSH key along with the label (a name you give to identify it). This command helps in identifying the correct SSH key to use when configuring a new Git client or server, for example, by comparing the displayed key IDs with those stored in your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file.'
