    command: |-
        [AI] The `npm` (Node Package Manager) `access` command is used to manage publishing permissions for an npm organization or a specific scope within an organization.

        There are several sub-commands for this command:

        1. `npm adduser <email> <password>`: This is used to add a new user to the organization with given email and password.
        2. `npm deauth <token>`: This is used to revoke an access token, which can be useful if you suspect that your account has been compromised.
        3. `npm publish <package>`: When run within an npm package directory, this command publishes the package to the registry with the organization's credentials.
        4. Other sub-commands include `login`, `logout`, and `whoami`, which are used to manage user authentication for publishing packages under an organization.
        5. The `access` command also supports various options like `admin <username/email> [true|false]` and `role <role-name> <username/email> [add|remove]`, which can be used to grant or revoke administrative permissions and different roles within the organization, respectively.
