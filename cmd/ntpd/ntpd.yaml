documentation:
    command: '[AI] "ntpd" is the name of the Network Time Protocol daemon, which is a software component used to synchronize the system clock of a computer over a network. It ensures that the local clock remains accurate by fetching time data from an external time server and adjusting the local clock accordingly. This helps maintain consistent and reliable timekeeping across a network or internet connection, especially in environments where high accuracy time synchronization is essential.'
    flag:
        '!': '[AI] The command `ntpd -!` is used in Unix-based systems to start the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon in debug mode with the exclamation mark (!) being a shorthand option that sets NTP to listen on the local interface only and not synchronize the system clock against any NTP servers. In other words, `ntpd -!` starts the NTP daemon in a way that it only functions as an NTP server and does not accept time synchronization from external sources.'
        '?': '[AI] The command `ntpd -?` is used to display help information for the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon in Unix-like operating systems. The `ntpd` is a program that synchronizes the system clock with other computers or time servers over the network. The `-?` option is used to invoke the help function of the program, which displays a usage message and lists available command line options and their functions.'
        "4": '[AI] The command `ntpd -4` is used to configure the Network Time Protocol (NTP) client on Unix-based systems to use IPv4 addresses only for synchronizing system time with NTP servers. The `ntpd` is the NTP daemon, and the `-4` option specifies that it should use IPv4 addresses exclusively. This can be useful in environments where IPv4 addressing is used consistently, or where there are compatibility issues with IPv6 addresses.'
        "6": '[AI] The command `ntpd -6` is used to configure the Network Time Protocol (NTP) client on Unix-based systems to synchronize time with a specified NTP server using IPv6 addresses instead of IPv4 addresses. The `ntpd` is the NTP daemon, and the option `-6` specifies that only IPv6 addresses should be used for NTP server communication.'
        A: '[AI] The `ntpd` command with the option `-A` (or `--authenticate`) is used in the Network Time Protocol (NTP) environment for enabling and managing cryptographic authentication key signing and verification. With this option, the NTP daemon can secure communications between trusted NTP servers by exchanging and verifying cryptographic keys to ensure the authenticity and integrity of time data being synchronized.'
        D: '[AI] The command `ntpd -D` is used to start the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon in debug mode on Unix or Linux systems. NTP is a protocol used to synchronize the clock of computer systems over a network. By starting NTP in debug mode with `-D`, more detailed diagnostic information is output, which can be helpful for troubleshooting and understanding the behavior of the NTP daemon.'
        G: '[AI] `ntpd` is a network time protocol daemon used to synchronize the system clock with remote servers on a network. The option `-G` is a non-standard option specific to some implementations of NTPD, including NTP version 4. It stands for "SymmetricKey Generator," which is used to generate and manage symmetric keys for NTP authentication. With this option, the daemon generates new keys or loads keys from a file, enabling secure time synchronization over an insecure network.'
        I: '[AI] `ntpd -I` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to adjust system time using the Network Time Protocol (NTP). The `-I` option specifies that the clock should be set interactively, which means it will not adjust the system time unless the difference between local and remote NTP server''s time is greater than the specified threshold (default 128ms). This can be useful when testing NTP synchronization without making large, potentially disruptive time jumps.'
        L: '[AI] `ntpd -L` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to adjust the system clock using Network Time Protocol (NTP). The `-L` option stands for "loopback," which instructs NTP to synchronize with the local host, effectively checking the accuracy of the local clock against the NTP time pool. This can be helpful in testing or debugging NTP configurations.'
        "N": '[AI] `ntpd -n` is a command used in Unix-based systems to run the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon in "noquery" mode. In this mode, NTP does not listen for queries on its default port 123 and doesn''t write any query or response packets to the system log files. It only synchronizes the system clock with remote NTP servers and runs as a background service.'
        P: '[AI] The `ntpd` command with the option `-P` is used to force the use of a specific NTP (Network Time Protocol) server as the primary or preferred source of time synchronization for the system. The flag ensures that the system uses the specified NTP server''s time, even if there are other available servers. This can be useful in situations where you want to ensure your system is synchronized with a particular remote clock for accuracy or security reasons.'
        U: '[AI] The `ntpd` command with the option `-U` is used in Unix-based systems for setting the system clock using a time server, specifically using the Universal (unicast) mode of Network Time Protocol (NTP). In this mode, an NTP client sends a single unsolicited request to a specific NTP server to set the local clock. This option does not return any output by default and is useful when automating clock synchronization tasks or in scripts.'
        a: '[AI] The `ntpd -a` command is used in Unix-based systems to adjust system time using the Network Time Protocol (NTP). The `-a` option stands for "adjust," which instructs the NTP daemon (ntpd) to update the local system clock based on the received time data from a trusted NTP server. This command doesn''t display any output but ensures the system clock stays synchronized with accurate time sources, improving overall system performance and security.'
        b: '[AI] `ntpd -b` is a command used in Unix-based systems to configure the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon to behave as a client and synchronize its clock with an NTP server. The `-b` option stands for "broadcast" or "client" mode, which means that the system will send broadcast requests on the local network to find available NTP servers and select the best one to sync with automatically. This command is typically used when setting up a new system or when the system clock needs to be synchronized with an external time source.'
        c: '[AI] The `ntpd` command with the option `-c` is used to configure the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon with a specific configuration file instead of using the default one. This can be useful when you want to apply custom settings or override the defaults, such as specifying particular time servers to synchronize with or setting up access control rules. The configuration file is usually named `ntp.conf` and should be located in the specified path or the one defined in the NTP search directory list.'
        d: '[AI] `ntpd -d` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to run the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon in debug mode. NTP is a protocol used to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network. By running `ntpda` with the `-d` flag, more detailed debugging information is displayed, allowing administrators to troubleshoot any issues related to time synchronization.'
        f: '[AI] `ntpd -f` is a command used in Unix-based systems to adjust the system clock using Network Time Protocol (NTP). The `-f` option tells NTP daemon to forcefully update the system clock, even if it means setting the clock back or forward by more than the normal maximum drift limit. This can be useful when the system clock is significantly out of sync and needs to be adjusted quickly. However, it should be used with caution as large clock adjustments may cause issues with some applications that rely on precise timekeeping.'
        g: '[AI] The command `ntpd -g` is used with the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon to set or query its global configuration variables, without affecting the operating system''s clock. This is typically done when managing multiple NTP servers in a network. The `-g` option stands for "global options," and it allows you to modify or view various NTP settings, such as peer addresses, fallback servers, and broadcast/multicast addresses. Using this command can help ensure that all the NTP servers within a network are synchronized with each other and maintain accurate timekeeping.'
        i: '[AI] `ntpd -i` is a command used in Unix-based systems to adjust the system clock using the Network Time Protocol (NTP). The `-i` option instructs NTP daemon to force an immediate update of the system clock, without waiting for the normal polling interval. This can be useful when the system clock is significantly out of sync and needs to be corrected urgently.'
        k: '[AI] The command `ntpd -k` is used in Unix or Linux systems to force-sync the system clock with the time provided by an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server, without waiting for the normal drift correction process. The `-k` option stands for "force," and it tells the NTP daemon to adjust the system clock immediately upon receiving the time update from the server, instead of waiting for the regular drift check interval. This can be useful in situations where the system clock is significantly out of sync with the reference time and needs to be corrected urgently.'
        l: '[AI] The command `ntpd -l` in Unix or Linux systems is used to display the log file for the NTP (Network Time Protocol) daemon. NTP helps keep the system clock synchronized with internet time servers. This command shows the location and size of the NTP log file, which may contain information about the NTP synchronization status, errors, and other relevant events.'
        "n": '[AI] The command `ntpd -n` is used to tell the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon not to listen for incoming NTP packets and not to sync the system clock with any NTP servers. Instead, it sets the system clock based on the configuration file or manual setting only. The `-n` option stands for "no listen" or "nobody", indicating that the NTP service should not respond to queries from other systems.'
        p: '[AI] `ntpd -p` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to start the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon in the foreground mode without detaching it from the terminal. The `-p` option tells the NTP daemon not to run in the background, allowing the output and errors to be displayed on the console. This can be useful for debugging or monitoring the NTP synchronization process.'
        q: '[AI] `ntpd -q` is a command used in Unix-based systems to query the NTP daemon (Network Time Protocol) for its current time and faults status without actually adjusting the system clock. The `-q` option stands for "quiet," which means that only essential information will be displayed, making it suitable for scripts or automated tasks.'
        r: '[AI] The `ntpd -r` command is used in Unix-like operating systems to adjust the system clock using the time data from a remote NTP (Network Time Protocol) server. The `-r` option specifies that the system should only set the clock and not synchronize the clock in the background. This can be useful when you need to quickly set the clock to a specific value before continuing with other tasks.'
        s: '[AI] The `ntpd -s` command is used in Unix-based systems to synchronize the system clock with an external NTP (Network Time Protocol) server. The `-s` option tells the ntpd daemon to set the system clock based on the received time data without making any adjustments. This can be useful when initially setting up a system or when the system clock is significantly out of sync and needs to be corrected quickly.'
        t: '[AI] `ntpd -t` is a command used in Unix-based systems to test the configuration of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon before enabling it in production. The `-t` option stands for "testonly" or "simulate" mode, which means that the NTP daemon will not actually change the system clock but will simulate the clock adjustments based on the received time data. This allows users to verify that their NTP servers are configured correctly without affecting the system clock. If the test is successful, the user can then enable the NTP service to synchronize the system clock in real-time with external time sources.'
        u: '[AI] `ntpd -u` is a command used in Unix-based systems to adjust the system clock using Network Time Protocol (NTP). The `-u` option sets NTP to user mode, which means it runs as a user process rather than a daemon. This can be useful for troubleshooting or testing NTP synchronization without having it start automatically at boot time.'
        w: '[AI] The `ntpd -w` command is used in the context of the Network Time Protocol (NTP). It stands for "peer with" mode and is used to configure NTP to synchronize with a specific NTP server as a peer rather than a client. In this mode, both the client and server can adjust their clocks based on the difference in clock time between them, resulting in improved accuracy of timekeeping. This mode also allows for symmetric key authentication between the peers for increased security.'
        x: '[AI] `ntpd -x` is a command used in Unix-based systems to adjust the system clock using NTP (Network Time Protocol). The `-x` option tells NTP daemon to set the system clock based on the given time, rather than syncing the clock with a remote server. This can be useful when the system clock needs to be manually corrected and there is no reachable NTP server.'
