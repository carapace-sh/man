    command: '[AI] `glab repo` is a GitLab CLI command used to manage GitLab repositories. It provides several sub-commands for interacting with projects, such as creating, listing, and configuring remote repositories. The basic usage is `glab repo <subcommand> [<project_path or project_ID]`, where `<subcommand>` represents the desired action (e.g., `create`, `list`, etc.). For more detailed information on each sub-command, run `glab repo --help`.'
