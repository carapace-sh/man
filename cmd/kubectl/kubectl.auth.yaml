        [AI] The `kubectl auth` command is not a valid or recognized command in Kubernetes or `kubectl`. The `kubectl` tool is used to deploy, manage, and configure applications within Kubernetes clusters using manifests, but it does not have a specific "auth" sub-command.

        To manage authentication and authorization in Kubernetes, you can use various methods such as:

        1. Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Manage access to Kubernetes resources based on roles and permissions.
        2. OAuth2 or OpenID Connect: Use these protocols for external authentication and authorization.
        3. Service Accounts: Assign access rights to specific services in a cluster.
        4. Cluster-level RBAC: Manage access to the entire Kubernetes cluster with ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding objects.
