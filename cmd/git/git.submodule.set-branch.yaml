    command: '[AI] `git submodule set-branch` is a Git command used to switch the branch of a specified submodule to a given branch or commit hash. It takes the following format: `git submodule set-branch <path-to-submodule> <branch-name>`. This command performs an automatic fetch and checkout, updating both the local and remote references to the new branch. Note that you need to have the necessary permissions on the remote repository for this command to work effectively.'

        branch: |-
            [AI] `git submodule set-branch` is a Git command used to set the branch of a specified submodule to a given branch name. When you have a Git repository with one or more submodules, each submodule can be managed as its own independent Git repository. The `set-branch` option allows you to change the branch that the submodule is tracking within your main repository.

            For example:
            ```bash
            git submodule set-branch <submodule_name> <branch_name>
            ```
            Replace `<submodule_name>` with the name of the submodule, and `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you want to switch to in that submodule. This command will update the `.git/config` file within your main repository to reflect the new branch configuration for the specified submodule.

            After running this command, you can use `git pull` or other fetching commands to update the submodule's content according to the new branch.
        default: '[AI] `git submodule set-branch --default` is a Git command used to set the default branch of a submodule. A Git submodule is a nested Git repository within another Git project. This command updates the .git/config file of the parent project to specify the desired branch name under the "[submodule <name>]" section for the given submodule. By using "--default", this new branch becomes the default branch for that submodule whenever it''s checked out or initialized in future.'
