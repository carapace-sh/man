documentation:
    command: '[AI] `toit lsp completion powershell` is a command used in PowerShell for enabling Language Server Protocol (LSP) based completions with Toit, a statically typed programming language, using the Microsoft PowerShell scripting language. This command assumes that Toit LSP server and a compatible PowerShell IDE or editor are installed. The command itself may not be directly executable as it''s a logical description of an action rather than a specific command to run. Instead, you might need to configure your IDE or editor, such as Visual Studio Code with the PowerShell extension, to enable LSP completions for Toit using this approach.'
    flag:
        no-descriptions: |-
            [AI] The command `toit lsp completion powlershell --no-descriptions` is related to the use of the Toit Language Server Process (LSP) for PowerShell scripting in Visual Studio Code or other compatible editors.

            The flag `--no-descriptions` is used to disable the display of description text during code completions. This means that when you press Ctrl+Space or F12 to trigger completion suggestions, only the completion options themselves will be shown without any additional textual descriptions or tooltips for each suggestion.

            In summary, this flag helps keep the PowerShell code editor's interface more minimal and focused on the code completion options alone.
