description: Run a script defined in the package.json
group: general
flags:
    --inspect: Forwarded to the underlying Node process when executing a binary
    --inspect-brk: Forwarded to the underlying Node process when executing a binary
    -B, --binaries-only: Ignore any user defined scripts and only check for binaries
    -T, --top-level: Check the root workspace for scripts and/or binaries instead of the current one
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `yarn run` is a command used in Yarn package manager to execute a defined script written in a `package.json` file under the key `scripts`. For instance, running `yarn run build` would execute the `build` script defined in the `scripts` section of your project''s `package.json` file. This allows for easy execution of common tasks within a project.'
    flag:
        binaries-only: '[AI] `yarn run --binaries-only` is a command used with Yarn, a popular JavaScript package manager. This command instructs Yarn to only install and build the binary executables defined in the `package.json` file''s scripts section without running them. It can help save time by installing just the binaries needed for a project without running any additional scripts.'
        inspect: '[AI] `yarn run --inspect` is a command used with Yarn, a popular package manager for JavaScript projects. The `--inspect` flag instructs Yarn to start a new Node.js process and attach the Chrome DevTools Debugger to it. This allows developers to inspect, debug, and set breakpoints in their Node.js application while it''s running. It is typically used with development scripts defined in a package.json file for easier debugging.'
        inspect-brk: '[AI] `yarn run --inspect-brk` is a command used with Yarn, a popular package manager for JavaScript projects. This command starts a new development server using the Node.js inspector tool in breakmode (--inspect-brk). Breakmode allows the debugger to pause execution when a specified exception or error occurs. It''s commonly used for debugging Node.js applications and is particularly helpful when working on complex codebases, as it helps identify issues at their source.'
        top-level: '[AI] The `yarn run --top-level` command is used in Yarn, a popular package manager for JavaScript projects. It specifies that the given script should be executed at the root level of the project, without traversing up to find a package.json file. This can be useful when working with monorepos or multi-package projects where multiple package.json files exist, and you want to ensure that a specific script runs in the context of the root project.'
