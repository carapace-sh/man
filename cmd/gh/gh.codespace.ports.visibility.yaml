    command: |-
        [AI] The `gh codespace ports visibility` command in GitHub CLI (GitHub's command-line tool) is used to manage the visibility of ports exposed in a GitHub Codespace. This command allows you to control whether the ports are publicly accessible or only accessible from specific IP addresses. The usage is:

        ```bash
        gh codespace port <port> visibility [--ip-addresses <IP_ADDRESS|IP_CIDR>] [--public | --private]
        ```

        Here, `<port>` represents the number of the specific port you want to configure. You can set the visibility as either public or private. If you choose the `--public` option, the ports will be accessible from anywhere. By contrast, if you use the `--private` option, you'll need to specify one or more IP addresses (in CIDR notation) using the `--ip-addresses` flag for the ports to be accessible only from those specified addresses.
