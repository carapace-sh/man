        [AI] `gh repo delete` is a GitHub CLI (Command-Line Interface) command used to delete a repository from your local machine or a specific GitHub account. The basic usage is as follows:

        1. Authenticate with GitHub using the CLI with the `gh auth login` command if not already logged in.
        2. Provide the GitHub username or organization name and repository name in the following format: `gh repo delete [USERNAME|ORGANIZATION]/[REPOSITORY-NAME]`.
        3. Confirm the deletion by entering "yes" when prompted, or use the `--force` flag to bypass confirmation: `gh repo delete --force [USERNAME|ORGANIZATION]/[REPOSITORY-NAME]`.
        4. The command will then delete the specified repository from GitHub. Be aware that this action cannot be undone once completed.
    flag:
        confirm: '[AI] `gh repo delete --confirm` is a command used in GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, `gh`. This command is used to permanently delete a repository from your GitHub account. The `--confirm` flag is optional but recommended for security reasons. It adds an extra confirmation step before the deletion process. When you run this command without `--confirm`, GitHub will ask you to type "yes" in the terminal to confirm the deletion. However, using the `--confirm` flag forces GitHub to require you to input a personal access token (PAT) or two-factor authentication code for an additional layer of security before executing the command. This helps prevent accidental deletions.'
        "yes": '[AI] `git hub repo delete --yes` is a GitHub CLI command used to permanently delete a repository from your GitHub account. The `--yes` or `-y` flag is used to confirm that you want to perform this action without any further prompts for confirmation. This command should only be used with caution as deleting a repository cannot be undone.'
