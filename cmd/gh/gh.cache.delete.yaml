description: Delete Github Actions caches
flags:
    -a, --all: Delete all caches
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh cache delete` is a GitHub Action command used to remove specific cached items from GitHub''s global caches. By default, it deletes all cached data. However, you can specify a key or pattern to delete specific entries. For example, `gh actions run my_workflow --cache=node_modules:v1` sets a cache key for Node.Modules and running `gh cache delete node_modules:` removes the cache entry with that key. This command improves workflow execution time by reusing previously built dependencies or data.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `gh cache delete --all` is a command used in GitHub''s Ghost CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. It instructs the tool to delete the entire content of the local cache. This can help resolve issues with outdated or corrupted cached data, particularly when working with large repositories or complex workflows. Using this command will clear the cache and require more time for future GitHub-related operations as the data needs to be fetched anew.'
