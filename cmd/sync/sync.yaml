documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `sync` command is a Linux utility used to ensure that data has been safely written to stable storage, such as a hard drive or solid-state drive. It synchronously writes data from volatile memory (RAM) to non-volatile storage, minimizing the risk of data loss due to power outages or system crashes. By invoking `sync`, the operating system will flush all dirty buffers in the page cache to the disk. This command is often used before shutting down a system to ensure that all changes are persisted before rebooting.'
    flag:
        data: '[AI] The `--data` flag in the `sync` command is used with Git, a version control system. When this flag is passed to the `git sync` command, it instructs Git to pull any new changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local repository. This also updates your local repository with any new data or files from the remote repository without requiring an interactive commit message for each change. In essence, it ensures that both your local and remote repositories have the same content.'
        file-system: |-
            [AI] The `sync --file-system` command in Linux is used to ensure that all pending file system operations are written to disk, making the file system consistent. This can help prevent data loss or corruption, especially during power failures or system crashes.

            The `--file-system` option specifies that only the specified file systems should be synchronized, rather than all of them. If no file system is specified, then all mounted file systems are synced by default. The command does not return until all filesystems have been successfully synchronized.
        help: '[AI] The `--help` option when used with the Git command `git sync` displays detailed help information about how to use the `git sync` command. This includes information about what `git sync` does, its various options and arguments, and examples of how it can be used to synchronize repositories or branches between remotes and local repositories. It is a way to quickly familiarize yourself with the usage and functionality of this specific Git command.'
        version: '[AI] `sync --version` is a command used in various file systems and distributed systems, including Linux file systems and Git version control system. Its primary function is to display the current version or information about the specific synchronization tool being used. When run with this command, it will output the name of the software, its version number, and sometimes additional details such as compilation flags or build date.'
