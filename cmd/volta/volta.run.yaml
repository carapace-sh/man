documentation:
    command: '[AI] `volta run` is a command used in Volta, a new and open-source toolchain manager for JavaScript projects. This command is utilized to execute a specific task or script defined in a `volta.yml` file within your project. It automatically installs and manages the dependencies needed to run the task, ensuring a consistent environment for your project.'
    flag:
        bundled-npm: '[AI] `volta run --bundled-npm` is a command used in Volta, a modern toolkit for managing Node.js projects. This command runs a project using Volta''s built-in NPM package manager with all dependencies bundled inside the project. It ensures a consistent and reproducible environment by avoiding the use of system or global NPM installations.'
        env: '[AI] The `volta run --env` command is used with Volta, a toolchain manager for Node.js projects. This command allows running a script within a specific environment defined in an `.env` file. The flag `--env` followed by the name of the environment to use tells Volta to load and use the corresponding environment variables from the specified `.env` file while executing the script. This can be helpful for managing different environments, such as development, testing, or production, each with its own set of required configurations.'
        help: '[AI] The `--help` option when used with the Volta CLI command `run`, displays detailed information about how to use the `run` command for managing tasks and workflows in Volta projects. This includes options for specifying a task name, passing arguments to tasks, using environments, and more. For comprehensive usage instructions, refer to the output of `volta run --help`.'
        no-yarn: '[AI] The `volta run --no-yarn` command is used in Volta, a modern toolkit for JavaScript projects, to execute a script without using Yarn as the package manager. Instead, Volta will use its built-in package management and node version management capabilities. This can be useful when you want to avoid using Yarn or have specific requirements for your project''s dependency resolution.'
        node: '[AI] The `volta run --node` command is used in Volta, a tool for managing Node.js projects, to execute a script with Node.js as the runtime environment. The `--node` flag indicates that Volta should use Node.js to run the specified script or task. It''s equivalent to running `npx node <script>` or `npm run node <script>`, but with the added benefits of using Volta for project management and package installation.'
        npm: '[AI] `volta run --npm` is a command used with Volta, a modern JavaScript tool manager. It instructs Volta to execute an NPM (Node Package Manager) script within the context of a specific project. The project must have a `volta.yml` file defining its tools and dependencies, including scripts that can be run using Volta. This command facilitates running these defined scripts with NPM''s capabilities, making it a versatile way to manage and execute project-specific tasks.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `volta run --quiet` command is used with Volta, a modular toolsuite for Node.js projects. The `--quiet` flag instructs Volta to run the specified command without printing any informational or status messages in the console. This option is useful when running automated scripts or continuous integration workflows where silence is desired.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `volta run --verbose` command is used in Volta, a unified tool for managing JavaScript projects and their dependencies. When this command is executed, Volta runs the specified task or script with increased output detail, providing more information about each step taken during the process. This can be helpful for debugging or understanding what Volta is doing behind the scenes.'
        yarn: |-
            [AI] The `volta run --yarn` command is used with Volta, a modern JavaScript tooling installer and package manager, to run a script using Yarn as the package manager.

            When you use `volta run`, it checks for a `package.json` file in the current directory and looks for a script named "start" or one defined by the user. Then, it creates a new child process with the specified package manager (in this case, Yarn) to install the project's dependencies and run the script.

            So, running `volta run --yarn` is equivalent to using Yarn to manage your project dependencies and then running your project using the 'start' script or a custom script defined in your `package.json`.
