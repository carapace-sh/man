    command: '[AI] The `brew sh` command is not a valid command in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The correct usage to run a shell script installed by Homebrew would be `brew run <package-name>` or `brew exec <package-name> -- <args>`. The former runs the script in a new process, while the latter runs it in the current terminal session. `sh` is just a generic Unix shell name and doesn''t interact with Homebrew specifically.'
    flag:
        cmd: |-
            [AI] The command `brew sh --cmd` is not a standard or valid command in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command does not exist as-is in Homebrew's toolset.

            However, we can infer that this command might be an attempt to use Homebrew with the `sh` shell instead of its default `zsh`. To achieve that, you should configure Homebrew to use `sh` by editing your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile` file (depending on which shell you want to change). Add this line: `eval $(/usr/local/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)`.

            After configuring the file, run `source <filename>` to apply the changes. Now, when using the terminal with your chosen shell, you can use Homebrew commands like `brew install`, etc., without having to prefix them with 'brew' or 'brew exec'. The full command would look like: `sh -c 'brew install <package-name>'`.

            The `--cmd` argument doesn't seem to have any relevance to this scenario.
        debug: |-
            [AI] `brew debug` is not a valid command in Homebrew, which is a popular package manager for macOS. The correct command to start a Homebrew installation or upgrade with additional output for debugging purposes is `brew install --debug <package>` or `brew upgrade --debug <package>`.

            When executed, these commands initiate the installation or upgrade process while providing detailed information about each step taken, making it easier to diagnose potential issues.
        env: |-
            [AI] The `brew shell-env` command is a function provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, that allows you to easily activate the Homebrew environment in your terminal sessions.

            When executed, it sets several variables in your shell's environment, such as `PATH`, which includes the Homebrew directories where binaries and other packages are installed. This ensures that you can run Homebrew-installed programs from anywhere on your system without having to prefix their commands with the path to the installation directory.

            This command is typically used in your shell startup files, like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, so it gets executed whenever a new terminal session is started. This ensures that your Homebrew environment is always available in your terminal sessions.
        help: '[AI] `brew help sh` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command displays detailed help information about the Homebrew formula for installing and managing the GNU Shell (sh). It shows options that can be passed during installation or updating, dependencies, and other relevant details.'
        quiet: '[AI] `brew` is a package manager for macOS using Homebrew. The command `brew install --quiet` installs a package silently, meaning it will not display any progress messages or other output during the installation process. This can be useful if you want to run multiple installations in the background without interruptions from terminal output.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] The `brew` command is a package manager for Homebrew, a popular software installation system for macOS. The `sh` following `brew` suggests that this is being used within a shell environment, such as Bash or Zsh.

            The `--verbose` flag is an option to provide more detailed information about the commands and actions being performed by Homebrew during package installations or other tasks. When you run `brew sh --verbose`, it executes the next Homebrew command with enhanced verbosity output, making it easier to understand the sequence of events and troubleshoot any issues that might arise.
