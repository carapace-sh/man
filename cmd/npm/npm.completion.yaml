description: Tab Completion for npm
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm completion` command is not a valid NPM (Node Package Manager) command. It seems like there might be some confusion with other terminal commands or autocompletion features that different terminal applications or IDEs might provide. In general, NPM provides various commands for managing packages in Node.js projects, such as `npm install`, `npm update`, and `npm run`. For autocompletion, you can use the built-in tab completion feature in your terminal or set up an IDE or text editor to provide suggestions based on the installed NPM packages and package.json file.'
