documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `systemctl` command with the argument `service-log-level` is used to inspect or modify the log level of a systemd service. The log level determines the severity of messages that get recorded in the journal files. For instance, `sudo systemctl --no-pager status myservice --follow --level info` will display the real-time log output of the "myservice" service with an info log level, while `sudo systemctl is-enabled myservice --level=err` checks if the error logs for "myservice" are currently enabled.'
