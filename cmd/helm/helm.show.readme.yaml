flags:
    --ca-file=: verify certificates of HTTPS-enabled servers using this CA bundle
    --cert-file=: identify HTTPS client using this SSL certificate file
    --devel: use development versions, too. Equivalent to version '>0.0.0-0'. If --version is set, this is ignored

    --key-file=: identify HTTPS client using this SSL key file
    --keyring=: location of public keys used for verification
    --pass-credentials: pass credentials to all domains
    --password=: chart repository password where to locate the requested chart
    --repo=: chart repository url where to locate the requested chart
    --username=: chart repository username where to locate the requested chart
    --verify: verify the package before using it
    --version=: specify a version constraint for the chart version to use. This constraint can be a specific tag (e.g. 1.1.1) or it may reference a valid range (e.g. ^2.0.0). If this is not specified, the latest version is used
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `helm show readme` is a Helm command used to display the contents of the README file for a specific chart. This command retrieves the latest version of the chart from the Helm repository and outputs its README content in the terminal. It''s commonly used for quickly reviewing the documentation or understanding the usage and features of a particular Helm chart.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] `helm show readme` is a Helm command used to display the contents of a Helm chart''s `Chart.yaml` file and its associated `values.yaml`, `readme.md`, and `values.schema.json`. The `--ca-file` flag is an optional argument provided with this command for specifying a custom CA (Certificate Authority) certificate to use for SSL/TLS verification when communicating with the remote Helm repository. This flag helps ensure secure communication between your local machine and the Helm chart repository, especially in cases where you''re using self-signed or custom certificates.'
        cert-file: '[AI] `helm show readme` is a Helm command used to display the contents of the Chart''s `Chart.yaml` file and its `values.yaml` file, which provide essential metadata and configuration details for the Helm chart respectively. The `--cert-file` option is used in conjunction with this command to specify a custom SSL certificate file to be employed when communicating with the remote Helm repository over HTTPS. This helps ensure secure and encrypted communication during the installation or upgrading of Helm charts from the specified repository.'
        devel: '[AI] `helm show readme --devel` is a command used with Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes. This command retrieves and displays the content of the `README.md` file from a specific Helm chart repository or local chart, in its development (or "raw") state. The flag `--devel` indicates that the output should include all files present in the chart directory, including those not typically exposed by default. This can be useful when working on chart development or customization.'
        insecure-skip-tls-verify: |-
            [AI] `helm show readme` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to display the details of a Helm chart, including its description, installation instructions, and other metadata.

            The `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` flag is an optional argument that can be passed to this command to disable TLS certificate verification during communication between Helm and the remote chart repository. This means that Helm will not check the authenticity of the SSL certificates presented by the repository, and may trust potentially malicious or untrusted sources.

            Using this flag is generally not recommended for production environments, as it poses a significant security risk by allowing man-in-the-middle attacks and other forms of certificate spoofing. It should only be used in controlled environments where the security risks are understood and acceptable.
        key-file: |-
            [AI] `helm show` is a Helm command used to retrieve information about a specific chart or release. The `readme` subcommand displays the contents of the `Chart.yaml` file and other files in the chart's `values.yml`, `templates`, and `README.md` (if present).

            The `--key-file` option specifies the path to a file containing an RSA private key used for authentication when accessing a Helm repository hosted over TLS. This is necessary if you don't have the certificate authorities trusted by your system or if you want to use a specific client certificate for authentication. The flag helps ensure secure communication and access to the desired chart repository.
        keyring: '[AI] `helm show readme` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager, to display the details of a specific chart repository or release. The `--keyring` flag is an optional argument that specifies the location of the Helm keyring file. This file stores encryption keys used for authentication and communication with Helm repositories that use TLS encryption. By providing this flag, Helm will use the specified keyring file to decrypt and access the repository data.'
        pass-credentials: '[AI] `helm show readme` is a Helm command used to display the contents of a Helm chart''s `Chart.yaml` file and its associated `values.yaml`, `readme.md`, and other files. The `--pass-credentials` flag is an optional argument that allows passing Helm''s authentication data (e.g., Tiller server access token or Kubernetes context) to downstream commands, such as those invoked by the `helm install` or `helm upgrade` commands. This ensures that the authenticated user has the required privileges for interacting with the targeted cluster or chart repository.'
        password: |-
            [AI] The `helm show readme` command in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager, displays the contents of the `Chart.yaml` file and other relevant files in a Helm chart repository. The `--password` flag is not part of this standard command. It seems you might have accidentally included it in your query. If you meant to run the command without any password-related options, just use:

            ```bash
            helm show readme <chart-name>
            ```
        repo: '[AI] `helm show readme` is a Helm command used to display the contents of a Helm chart''s `Chart.yaml` file and its associated `values.yaml`, `readme.md` or any otherMarkdown files in the chart repository. The `--repo` flag specifies that Helm should fetch the information from a specific Helm repository instead of using the local chart directory. For example, `helm show readme mychart --repo https://myregistry.com/charts`. This command is helpful when you want to review the documentation and usage instructions for a Helm chart before installing or upgrading it in your Kubernetes cluster.'
        username: |-
            [AI] The `helm show readme` command is used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager, to display the contents of a Helm chart's `Chart.yaml` file and its associated `README.md` file. This provides useful information about the chart, such as its version, description, and installation instructions.

            The option `--username` is used with this command for authentication purposes when accessing a private Helm repository that requires credentials. By providing a username with this flag, Helm will include the necessary authorization header in the request to the repository server. This ensures that the correct user account is identified during the chart installation process.
        verify: '[AI] `helm show readme` is a Helm command used to retrieve the contents of the `Chart.yaml` file and other files in the specified Helm chart''s `values.yaml`, `templates`, and `readme.md` directories. By adding the `--verify` flag, Helm will validate the retrieved chart against the Helm Hub repository or a local chart repository to ensure its authenticity and integrity before displaying the output. The combined command checks if the chart can be installed and gives information about it, as well as verifying the chart''s metadata and contents.'
        version: '[AI] `helm show readme --version` is a command used with Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes. This command displays the Readme file of a specific Helm chart, along with its current version number. The Readme file typically includes important information about how to install and use the application or service represented by the chart. By including the `--version` flag, you can see both the documentation and the exact version of the chart that you are working with.'
