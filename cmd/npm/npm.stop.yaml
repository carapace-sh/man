    --ignore-scripts: do not run scripts specified in package.json
    --script-shell=: shell to use
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `npm stop` is a command used in Node.js projects managed with npm (Node Package Manager). It gracefully terminates all running processes related to the current node project by sending SIGTERM signals to the child processes, and waits for them to finish before exiting. This avoids forcing termination of processes which can lead to data loss or inconsistent state in the application.'
    flag:
        ignore-scripts: '[AI] The `npm stop` command with the `--ignore-scripts` flag is used to stop all running scripts in a Node.js project without terminating the node process itself. This can be useful when you want to gracefully shut down a long-running process or when scripts are causing issues but you don''t want to completely terminate the node process. The `--ignore-scripts` flag prevents npm from attempting to run any pre- or post-install, prepare, or start scripts during the stop process.'
        script-shell: '[AI] The command `npm stop` is used to gracefully shut down a Node.js application that was started with `npm start`. The `--script-shell` option specifies which shell should be used to run the scripts defined in your `package.json` file. By default, this is set to `node-scripts` or `sh`, depending on your system. It''s important to note that this command does not stop any child processes, meaning you might need to use other methods like sending a SIGTERM signal to the parent process if your application has forked children processes.'
