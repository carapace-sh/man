documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `go-tool-cov` is a set of Go tools for profile and test data analysis. The `merge` command is used to combine multiple coverage data files generated during testing, into a single file. This merged data can then be used to produce reports that show the overall coverage of your codebase. The output file will contain the merged coverage information in a format suitable for input to other tools like `go-tool-cov`.'
    flag:
        cpuprofile: '[AI] The `go-tool-covdata merge -cpuprofile` command is a part of the Go toolchain used for code coverage analysis. This specific command merges multiple `.coverprofile` files generated during testing into a single `.cover.xml` file, and also merges multiple CPU profiles into a single CPU profile using the `-cpuprofile` flag. The merged results provide a more comprehensive view of code coverage and CPU usage across multiple tests or test runs.'
        hw: |-
            [AI] `go-tool-covdata` is a command-line tool in the Go programming language used for merging and processing code coverage data. The specific command `go-tool-covdata merge -hw` performs the following tasks:

            1. Merge: It merges multiple `.gcov` or `.coverprofile` files generated from separate Go source files during testing into a single coverage data file. This is useful when you have tested your application as a whole, rather than individually testing each component.

            2. -h (--header): This flag instructs the tool to add a header to the merged coverage data file. The default header includes information such as the Go version, operating system, and compiler used during the test run. You can customize the header by providing a `--headerfile` option instead.

            3. -w (--write): This flag specifies that the tool should write the resulting merged coverage data to a file rather than printing it directly to the console. The output file is specified using the `--output` or `-o` flag. For example, you might use `go-tool-covdata merge -hw --output merged_coverage.out coverfile1.gcov coverfile2.gcov`.
        i: '[AI] The `go-tool-covmerge` command with the `merge -i` flag is a part of the Go programming language''s testing and coverage analysis tools. This specific command merges individual test result coverage files into a single file. The `-i` option indicates an interactive merge, which allows the user to resolve any conflicts manually. In other words, it consolidates multiple coverage data sets from individual tests into one comprehensive dataset for further analysis.'
        memprofile: |-
            [AI] `go-tool-covdata merge -memprofile` is a command used in Go programming language for merging and generating memory profile data from multiple test runs. Here's a brief explanation of the flag:

            1. `go-tool-covdata`: This is a Go tool that processes coverage data generated during testing or profiling.
            2. `merge`: This action merges the results of multiple coverage analysis reports into a single one, improving accuracy and reducing noise.
            3. `-memprofile`: This flag instructs the tool to merge memory profiles instead of coverage data. Memory profiles show how much memory is allocated and used by each part of your code at different points in time during a test run or program execution.
            4. The output of this command will be a single merged memory profile file that can be analyzed using other tools, like the `pprof` tool from Go, to gain insights into memory usage patterns and potential memory leaks in your code.
        memprofilerate: |-
            [AI] The command `go-tool-covdata merge -memprofilerate` is used in Go programming language to merge multiple coverage files produced during testing, and also merge memory profile data from the Go profiling tool `pprof`.

            Here's a brief explanation of each part:

            1. `go-tool-covdata`: It's a command line tool that comes with the Go programming language for handling test coverage data.
            2. `merge`: This is an action taken by the tool to combine multiple input files into a single output file.
            3. `-memprofilerate`: This flag instructs the tool to merge memory profiles (produced using `pprof`) along with the coverage data. The `memprofilate` rate specifies the sampling interval for generating memory snapshots during profiling.

            In summary, this command merges multiple test coverage files and memory profile data into a single output file. This merged data can be used to analyze both the code coverage and memory usage patterns of your Go application.
        o: '[AI] `go-tool-covmerge` is a command-line tool in Go''s `$GOPATH/bin` directory used for merging multiple COV (code coverage) data files into a single one. The specific command `go-tool-covmerge -o merged_file.cov` instructs the tool to read input COV files from the standard input and merge them into a new file named `merged_file.cov`, which is then saved to the current directory. This operation is useful when analyzing the code coverage of multiple Go source files built with different test cases or runs, allowing for consolidated coverage reports.'
        pcombine: |-
            [AI] `go-tool-covdata` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language's standard library, used for managing and processing coverage data generated during testing.

            The `merge` subcommand merges multiple coverage data files into one. The `-pcombine` flag tells it to perform a per-file merge operation instead of a line-by-line merge, which results in more accurate coverage information when dealing with large or complex source code bases where multiple tests may modify the same source file.

            In summary, this command merges multiple Go test coverage data files using a per-file merge strategy to maintain accurate and consolidated coverage information.
        pkg: '[AI] The `go-tool-covdata merge -pkg` command is a part of the Go coverage tooling (gcov). This specific command merges the coverage data files generated by `gcov` for multiple packages into a single file. The `-pkg` option indicates that the input files are package-level coverage data files, which are created when running tests with the `cover` command followed by the `go test -cover` flag. By merging the data, we get an aggregate view of the coverage across all specified packages. This can be useful for analyzing the overall code coverage in larger projects with multiple interconnected packages.'
        v: '[AI] `go-tool-covdata` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library for handling code coverage data. The `merge` subcommand combines multiple `.gcov` or `.cover` files generated during testing into a single output file. The `-v` flag sets the verbosity level, providing more detailed information about the merging process.'
