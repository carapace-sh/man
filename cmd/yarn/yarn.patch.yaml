    command: '[AI] `yarn patch` is a command used with Yarn, a popular JavaScript package manager. It''s used to update dependencies in your project''s `package.json` file to the next minor version. This means that it will apply any bug fixes and improvements in the current minor release without affecting major or breaking changes. The command automatically identifies packages with outdated minor versions and updates them accordingly. To use it, simply run `yarn patch` from your project directory in the terminal.'
    flag:
        json: '[AI] `yarn patch --json` is a command used with Yarn, a popular package manager for JavaScript projects. This command applies a series of patches represented in a JSON format to manage and update specific files or directories within your project. The JSON format typically includes information such as the file path, the type of change (add, remove, or modify), and the content of the change. By using `--json` flag, Yarn processes these patches as JSON data instead of traditional patch files (e.g., .diff or .patch). This command is particularly useful when dealing with automated or scripted updates to your project''s dependencies or codebase.'
