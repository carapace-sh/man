    command: '[AI] The `tmux select-layout` command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, is used to change the layout of the attached windows within a TMUX session. It allows you to switch between different window arrangements such as horizontal or vertical splitting, or even tiling layouts like 2x2 or 3x3. By default, it selects the next available layout in the list, but you can specify a specific layout name if desired. This command is essential for efficiently managing multiple terminal sessions within TMUX.'
    flag:
        E: '[AI] The `tmux select-layout` command in TMUX is used to change the layout of the current pane or window. The `-E` option with this command enables an interactive editor to customize the layout. This means that instead of choosing from predefined layouts, you can design your own by splitting panes and windows as needed using keys like `%` for vertical splits and `z` for new windows. Once done, press `Enter` to apply the changes.'
        "n": '[AI] The `tmux` command `select-layout -n` is used to select a named window layout in the Terminal Multiplexer (tmux) application. The `-n` option specifies the name of the layout to be selected without activating it. This means that only the layout is changed, and the currently active window remains unchanged.'
        o: '[AI] The `tmux select-layout -o` command in Tmux is used to switch the currently selected window''s layout to the next one in the order defined by the `-L`, `-T`, and `-S` flags used with the `neww` or `new-session` commands. This allows for easily cycling through different pane arrangements within a single window, facilitating efficient multitasking in terminal-based workflows.'
        p: '[AI] The `tmux select-layout -p` command in TMUX is used to select a specific layout for the current pane or window. The `-p` option makes tmux print the name of the selected layout to the status bar without actually applying it. This means you can see which layout will be applied if you run this command, but it won''t change your panes or windows until you use a command like `select-layout <layout>` without the `-p` option.'

            [AI] The `tmux select-layout` command with the option `-t tag` in Tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) is used to apply a specific layout definition to the current window or selected windows.

            The layout definition is identified by a given tag, which can be named and saved using the `new-session -s session_name -d -c command "tmux neww -t layout_tag splitw -h 50 %"`, where `layout_tag` is replaced with the desired name.

            When using `select-layout -t tag`, Tmux will attempt to apply the defined layout that corresponds to the provided tag on the current or selected windows. The layout may consist of splitting panes horizontally (splitw), vertically (splitv), or both (split).
