        [AI] The `jj` command is a Git flow extension for Mercurial, which helps to implement Git-like workflows in Mercurial. The `branch create` subcommand creates a new branch and checks out the newly created branch in one step.

        Syntax: `jj branch create <new_branch_name> [<start_point>]`

        * `<new_branch_name>`: A descriptive name for the new branch.
        * `[<start_point>]`: An optional argument specifying where to start the new branch based on existing branches or commits. If not provided, it will create a new branch from the current head.

            [AI] The `jj branch create` command is a Git extension provided by JIRA Software Data Center and Server to create a new Git branch directly from the Jira interface, linked with a Jira issue. The `--help` option displays the detailed usage and available options for this command. Here's a brief summary:

            ```
            jj branch create [options] <branch_name> [<commit>]: Create a new Git branch from a commit or a tag, linking it to an issue

            Options:
              --issue=<issue_key>: Link the newly created branch to the given Jira issue (required)
                  --no-issue: Do not link the branch to an issue
                  --force: Force creation of a new branch even if it already exists and is not linked to an issue
                  --strategy=<strategy>: Specify the Git merge strategy (default: 'rebase')
                      --strategy=merge|rebase|ff-merge|squash|rebase-merge|no-ff
              --commit=<commit_message>: Set the commit message for the new branch creation
              --tags: Create a tag for the given commit (applies when creating a new branch from an existing commit)
              --force-push: Force push the new branch to the remote repository
            ```

            This command helps create a Git branch with linking it to a Jira issue, providing options such as selecting a merge strategy, setting a custom commit message, and force pushing the new branch.
        revision: '[AI] The `git jj branch create --revision` command creates a new Git branch starting from a specific commit revision instead of the current HEAD. This can be useful when creating a new branch based on a specific tag or commit, rather than the most recent one. The `--revision` option followed by the commit hash specifies the desired starting point for the new branch.'
