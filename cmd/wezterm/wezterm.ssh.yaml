documentation:
    command: '[AI] `wezterm ssh` is a command used in the Terminal to open an SSH (Secure Shell) connection with a remote server using WezTerm as the terminal emulator. It combines two actions: starting WezTerm and initiating an SSH session in one step. This can be convenient for users who prefer using WezTerm for their terminal sessions. The command assumes that an SSH config file is set up, specifying the remote server details.'
    flag:
        class: '[AI] `wezterm ssh --class` is a command used in the Wezterm terminal emulator to open an SSH (Secure Shell) session with the specified host, using the given class for window management. The class argument helps in organizing and managing multiple terminal windows or tabs, allowing users to apply custom decorations, floating mode, or other window behavior options.'
        help: '[AI] `wezterm ssh --help` is a command used in Wezterm, a terminal emulator for Unix and Wayland compositors. This specific command displays help information regarding Wezterm''s SSH (Secure Shell) functionality. It provides an overview of the various options that can be passed when using Wezterm to establish an SSH connection to a remote server, such as specifying the host address, port number, user name, authentication keys, and more. The help text also explains the general syntax and usage of the `wezterm ssh` command.'
        position: '[AI] `wezterm ssh --position` is a command used in the Wezterm terminal emulator to establish an SSH (Secure Shell) connection with a remote server while specifying custom positioning of the terminal window on the local machine. The `--position` option allows users to set the x and y coordinates or percentage values for the window''s placement, providing flexibility in managing multiple terminal sessions running concurrently.'
        ssh-option: '[AI] `wezterm ssh --ssh-option` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for Unix and Windows, to open an SSH (Secure Shell) session with specified options. The `--ssh-option` flag allows passing additional SSH configuration options as arguments, such as `-i keyfile` to specify the path to an SSH key file or `-o ServerAliveInterval=60` for keeping a connection alive. These options enhance the security and functionality of the SSH session.'
        v: '[AI] `wezterm ssh -v` is a command used in the terminal application, WezTerm, to start an SSH (Secure Shell) session with verbose output. The `-v` flag turns on the verbose mode, which means that WezTerm will print additional information about the connection establishment process, such as the SSH protocol versions being used, the keys being exchanged, and any potential errors or warnings. This can be useful for debugging SSH connections or understanding the underlying details of the connection process.'
