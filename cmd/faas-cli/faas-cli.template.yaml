        [AI] `faas-cli template` is a command provided by FaaS (Function as a Service) CLI, an open-source toolchain for building and deploying serverless functions using Docker containers. This command is used to generate a new Faas application based on a selected template.

        The available templates include different function programming languages such as Node.js, Go, Python, and Ruby, along with specific runtime environments or frameworks. When invoked, this command creates a new project directory with the specified structure and necessary configuration files, allowing you to start developing your serverless functions immediately.
