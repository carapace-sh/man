    command: '[AI] The `systemctl is-enabled` command is a part of Systemd, a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. This command is used to check whether a service has been enabled to start automatically at boot time or not. It returns one of the following outcomes: "enabled", "disabled" or "masked". A value of "enabled" indicates that the service will be started automatically upon boot, while "disabled" means it won''t. This command is typically used when managing services and ensuring their desired start-up behavior.'
