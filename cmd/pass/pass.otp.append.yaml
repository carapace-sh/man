documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pass otp append` command in GnuPG (GPG) is used to add a one-time password (OTP) to an existing key or seed file in OpenTPM format. This command appends the provided OTP data to the existing key or seed file without overwriting it. This allows for the use of multiple OTPs with a single key or seed, increasing security by adding an additional layer of protection beyond the primary private key.'
    flag:
        account: '[AI] The `pass otp append` command in the `GPG key management tool`, `GnuPG` or `GPG`, is used to add One-Time Passwords (OTP) to an existing key. The `--account` option specifies the account name associated with the key. In summary, this command appends a new OTP to the given account''s private key in GPG.'
        echo: |-
            [AI] The `pass otp append --echo` command in GNU `pass`, a password manager, appends a one-time password (OTP) to an existing record and displays the updated record on the terminal.

            Here's a brief explanation of each part:

            * `pass`: It's the name of the password manager tool.
            * `otp append`: This is the subcommand that deals with one-time passwords. The `append` part tells it to add a new OTP to an existing record.
            * `--echo`: This flag instructs the command to output the details of the updated record on the terminal after the operation is completed.
        force: '[AI] The command `pass otp append --force` is used in the Password Store application (GPG-protected keyring file) to add a one-time password (OTP) to an existing entry with an OTP secret. The `--append` option adds the new OTP to the existing list, and the `--force` option overwrites any conflicting data in the entry. If used without `--force`, Pass would raise an error if there''s a conflict.'
        issuer: '[AI] The `pass otp append --issuer` command is a flag used in the Google Authenticator tool for generating and managing two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. This specific flag is used to append an issuer string to the 2FA secret when generating a new code. An issuer is a human-readable identifier associated with the authenticator, which can help users distinguish between different services or applications using the same 2FA method. For example, an issuer might be the name of a service provider or a specific application within that provider''s ecosystem. The resulting OTP secret will include both the standard secret and the issuer string, allowing the user to identify the associated service upon scanning the QR code or entering the key manually.'
        secret: '[AI] The `pass` command is a password manager utility in Unix-like operating systems. The `otp append --secret` option is used to add an One-Time Password (OTP) secret key to an existing entry in the GPG-encrypted database managed by `pass`. With this option, you provide the secret as an argument for appending it to the corresponding record in the password database.'
