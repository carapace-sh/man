documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `hugo new site` command is used in Hugo, a popular open-source website framework written in Go. This command creates a new Hugo site project with default configuration files and directories in a specified local directory. It sets up the basic structure for a new Hugo site, including an `archetypes`, `content`, `data`, `layouts`, `static`, and `themes` folder. This is the starting point to build your website using Hugo''s powerful features like theming, static site generation, and Markdown support.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `hugo new site --force` is a command used with Hugo, a popular static website engine written in Go. The `new site` sub-command creates a new Hugo site from a given template or using the default one if none is specified. The `--force` flag is used to overwrite an existing site directory without asking for confirmation. This can be useful when accidentally creating a new site with the same name as an existing one, and you want to replace it rather than starting a new project.'
        format: '[AI] `hugo new site --format` is a command used in Hugo, a popular static site generator written in Go. This specific command creates a new Hugo site with a default structure using a specified output format. The `--format` option allows users to specify the desired format for the output files, which can be either "single" or "theme". A single site generates separate files for each page, while a theme consists of a directory containing all the necessary files to create a customizable site design.'
