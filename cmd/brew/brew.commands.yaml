    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `brew commands --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to run a specific Homebrew command with additional debugging output. When you run `brew commands --debug`, it will execute the next Homebrew command (which should follow in the same terminal session) with verbose debugging information. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and understanding what actions Homebrew is taking behind the scenes.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `brew help commands` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to display help information about available Brew commands. When you run this command in your terminal without any specific command argument, it will provide a list of all available Brew commands and a brief description of what each command does.

            If you provide the name of a specific command as an argument (e.g., `brew help install`), Homebrew will display more detailed help information about that particular command, including its usage and available options.
        include-aliases: '[AI] The `brew commands --include-aliases` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command modifies the output of other Brew commands by including aliases for installed packages and formulae in the terminal output. It doesn''t perform any installation or update actions but provides more detailed information when listing packages or searching for them.'
        quiet: '[AI] `brew commands --quiet` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--quiet` option suppresses informational output during the execution of other Homebrew commands. This means that only error messages will be displayed if any occur, allowing for a quieter and more focused terminal session when running Homebrew commands.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew commands --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output during command execution. When you run a Homebrew command with this flag, it will print detailed information about each step it takes to fulfill your request, including the exact paths to files being installed or updated, and any other relevant information. This can be helpful for troubleshooting, understanding what Homebrew is doing behind the scenes, or simply for learning more about how Homebrew functions.'
