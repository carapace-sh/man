    command: '[AI] The `tsh request drop` command is used in Tenable Security Center''s Tenable Security Logistics (TSH) tool to drop, or remove, an existing log ingestion request from the system. This command is typically invoked when a user has made a mistake while creating a new log ingestion request and wants to delete it to avoid processing or storing incorrect data. The `request` parameter specifies the ID of the log ingestion request to be dropped. For example, `tsh request drop <REQUEST_ID>`.'
