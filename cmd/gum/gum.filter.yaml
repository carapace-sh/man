    command: '[AI] The term "gum filter" is not a computer command, but rather a term used in photography for a specific type of filter. A gum filter is a type of dichroic filter that selectively absorbs red and infrared light while transmitting blue-green light. It is often used to enhance the contrast and saturation of blue skies or water in landscape photography. In a computer context, this term has no meaning.'
    flag:
        cursor-text.align: |-
            [AI] The `--gumfilter` and `--cursor-text.align` flags are used in Git Bash, a terminal emulator for running Bash commands on Git repositories.

            The `--gumfilter` flag is an option for the `git pull` command that allows users to filter the progress bar output during a git pull operation using the Gum package. Gum provides a customizable and interactive progress bar, making it easier to track the status of long-running Git operations.

            The `--cursor-text.align` flag is an option for the `git config` command that sets the horizontal alignment of the text in the Git prompt's cursor. This flag can be used with values such as "left," "right," or "center" to adjust the appearance of the Git prompt. For example, setting it to 'left' will align the cursor text to the left side of the Git prompt.
        cursor-text.background: '[AI] The `--gumfilter` option is used with Git for Bash to apply a real-time filter to the terminal output, such as autocompleting commands or displaying suggestions. The `--cursor-text.background` option sets the background color of the text displayed under the cursor when using Git''s auto-complete feature. It does not affect the appearance of the actual command being typed in the terminal.'
        cursor-text.bold: '[AI] The command `gum filter --cursor-text.bold` is used in Git Bash or Zsh terminal to apply a bold format to the text displayed as the cursor for filtering output with the Gum package. This command modifies the appearance of the text that indicates the current filter operation, making it more noticeable and easier to identify within the terminal output.'
        cursor-text.border: '[AI] The `--gum-filter` option is used with Git for Large Files (Git-LFS) to apply filters on large files before they are uploaded or synced. The `--cursor-text.border` flag modifies the appearance of the text cursor during Git LFS filtering progress, adding a border around it to provide better visual feedback during the filtering process.'
        cursor-text.border-background: '[AI] The `gum filter --cursor-text.border-background` is a command used in PowerShell with the Gumps (Gum) PowerShell module for text processing. This command sets the background color of the border surrounding the text cursor when using filters or transforms within Gum. For instance, if you want to highlight specific text in a colored box as you type it, this command helps achieve that effect.'
        cursor-text.border-foreground: |-
            [AI] The `--gum-filter` flag is used with Git command lines tools such as `git pull` or `git fetch`. It specifies to apply a Gumpty filter during the terminal output.

            The `gum filter --cursor-text.border-foreground` is a specific configuration option for this filter, which sets the color of the border around the cursor text in the terminal output. For example, it might be set to red (`--cursor-text.border-foreground=red`) or another color, making the cursor text stand out more clearly during Git operations.
        cursor-text.faint: '[AI] The `gum filter --cursor-text.faint` command is used in zsh (Z Shell) to customize the appearance of the cursor text. The `--cursor-text.faint` option sets the cursor text to be displayed in a faint or subdued color, making it less noticeable against the terminal background. This can be useful for those who prefer a minimalist or distraction-free terminal setup.'
        cursor-text.foreground: '[AI] The command `gum filter --cursor-text.foreground` is used in Git Bash or other terminal environments where Gum is installed. It sets the foreground color of the text displayed for the cursor during a Git operation using the Gum library. By default, this text is usually white, but you can change it to any valid ANSI color code or named color by adding this command in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) or passing it as an argument to specific Git commands. For example, `git status --cursor-text.foreground="red"` sets the cursor text to red during a git status command.'
        cursor-text.height: '[AI] The `--flag gum filter --cursor-text.height` is a command used in PowerShell, specifically with the `Select-String` cmdlet, to customize the height of the text displayed for the cursor as it searches through data. The "gum" part refers to the "Greedy Unique Matcher" alias for this option, and the `--cursor-text.height` sets the number of lines to display for the text representation of the cursor''s search result.'
        cursor-text.italic: '[AI] The `gum` flag `--cursor-text.italic` is a configuration option for the Git Unified Message (Gum) library in Git for Terminal. This option sets the cursor text style to italic when interacting with Git''s commit message editor. It can help distinguish the currently being edited text from the rest, making it easier for users to focus on editing their commit messages.'
        cursor-text.margin: '[AI] The `--gumfilter` option in PowerShell is used to filter the output of cmdlets, such as `Get-Help`, to exclude certain content like advertisements or marketing text. The `--cursortext.margin` option sets the width of the margin for displaying the cursor text during long-running commands. In summary, `gum filter --cursor-text.margin` is a PowerShell command line argument that filters output and customizes the appearance of the console cursor text with a specified margin width.'
        cursor-text.padding: '[AI] The `gum` flag `--cursor-text.padding` is used to configure the padding or spacing around text displayed as the cursor in a terminal application when using the `gum` package for interactive command-line prompts in Node.js. By setting this option, you can adjust the appearance of the cursor text to improve readability and alignment.'
        cursor-text.strikethrough: '[AI] The `gum filter --cursor-text.strikethrough` command is related to the Gum Pen, a text manipulation tool for the Windows Terminal or PowerShell. This specific command sets the cursor text style to strikethrough. When activated, any text input will appear with a horizontal line (strikeout) under the characters, visually indicating that they are being deleted or struck out.'
        cursor-text.underline: '[AI] The `--flag gum filter --cursor-text.underline` is a command for PowerShell, specifically for the Select-String cmdlet. This flag enables the Gum.ps1 filter and sets the underline style for the cursor text in the output. Gum is an external script that provides syntax highlighting and other enhancements when used with PowerShell. The underline cursor style indicates that there''s a match in the output, helping to improve the readability and accuracy of search results.'
        cursor-text.width: |-
            [AI] The `--flag gum filter` is a command option used in tools like PowerShell and Git Bash for enabling a more visually appealing output of text-based commands with progress indicators.

            The `--cursor-text.width` flag specifies the width of the progress indicator's cursor text. It helps customize the appearance of the progress bar by setting the length of the text that represents the ongoing task or process. This can help make the command output more readable and user-friendly, especially when performing long-running tasks.
        fuzzy: '[AI] The `--fuzzy` option used with the `grep` command in conjunction with a filter like `gum` (Git Untracked ls-tree Maker) modifies the search behavior to find matches that are approximately equal to the given pattern instead of exactly matching it. This is useful when dealing with inconsistent or imperfect data, as it allows for more flexible searching and can help capture intended results even if the exact keyword isn''t present in the file.'
        header: '[AI] The `--flag gum filter --header` is a command used in cURL, a popular command-line tool for transferring data between a client and server. This specific flag combination is used to format the output of HTTP requests or responses with human-readable format, specifically by filtering out the repetitive headers and only displaying unique ones. The `--header` flag allows users to include custom headers in their requests or responses.'
        header.align: |-
            [AI] The `gum filter --header.align` command in Git is used to align columns in a Git output, specifically with headers in the table format. When you have a large Git history or log with many columns, the default output might not perfectly align the column headers and data, making it harder to read.

            With `--header.align`, you can specify how to align each column header when displaying the output. By default, it uses left alignment for all columns (`--left-aligned` or `-l`). You can also choose right (`--right-aligned` or `-r`) or center (`--center-aligned` or `-c`) alignment for specific columns by providing their column indices or names. This way, you can improve the visual appearance of the output and enhance your Git experience.
        header.background: |-
            [AI] The `gum filter --header.background` is a command used in GUM (GNU UnxUtils) filtering tools, specifically with the `gum` filter, to modify or manipulate the background of header lines in text output.

            The syntax `--header.background` sets an option that modifies how the background color of header lines will be displayed when piping the output into a pager like `less` or `more`. By default, GUM filters don't change the background colors of header lines. Using this option with `--`, followed by the desired color name (for example, `--header.background red`), will set the background color for header lines to that specified color.
        header.bold: '[AI] The command `gum filter --header.bold` is used in Bash scripts with the GUM package installed to apply a bold format to the headers of text output. The `filter` function is a utility provided by GUM for manipulating and transforming text. The option `--header.bold` instructs the filter to apply bold formatting to any lines identified as headers.'
        header.border: '[AI] The `gum filter --header.border` command in PowerShell is used with the GUM (Graphical User Interface Model) library for creating interactive console applications. This specific filter applies a border to the headers of tables displayed in the console output. It doesn''t directly manipulate flags, but rather modifies the appearance of the output. For more information on using GUM filters, refer to the official Microsoft documentation.'
        header.border-background: |-
            [AI] The `--flag gum filter --header.border-background` is a command used in tools like `jq` or `Grep` to apply filters specifically for headers with border backgrounds. Here's a breakdown:

            1. `gum filter`: This refers to the use of GUM (General Utilities for Mac) filter, which provides additional filtering capabilities for commands like jq or grep.
            2. `--header`: It specifies that the filter should only be applied to header lines.
            3. `border-background`: This is a CSS property name, indicating that the filter will look for headers with a defined border background.
            4. The double hyphen (`--`) before each flag is used by command-line tools as a way of distinguishing user-defined flags from those built into the tool.
        header.border-foreground: |-
            [AI] The `--flag "gum filter" --header.border-foreground` is a command used with the Git Upgrade Manager (GUM) in Git, specifically when using filters to manipulate output.

            The flag `"gum filter"` enables the use of GUM filters within the terminal session. The header flag `--header.border-foreground` modifies the color or style of the border surrounding text in headers displayed by these filters. In this case, it sets the foreground color for the border.

            For instance, if you have a filter that lists your Git branches and wants to make the border around the header stand out more clearly, you could use `--header.border-foreground "red"` or another preferred color.
        header.faint: |-
            [AI] The `--gum-filter` and `--header.faint` flags are options used with astroML, a machine learning library for astronomy.

            The `--gum-filter` flag applies the GUM (Galactic UV Excess) filter to select sources that have excess ultraviolet emission likely due to interstellar reddening. This is useful for identifying stars and galaxies with significant dust extinction.

            The `--header.faint` flag sets astroML to consider only faint sources, based on their header information. This can help focus analysis on weaker signals or background objects that might otherwise be overlooked.
        header.foreground: '[AI] The `--flag gum filter --header.foreground` is a command for the `jq` data processing tool, specifically used to apply JSON filtering and manipulation. This flag configures `jq` to use the "gum" output format for printing filter results, which provides a more colorful and readable representation of JSON data. Additionally, `--header.foreground` sets the color of header keys to be printed in bold and foreground color, enhancing the visibility of headers in the output.'
        header.height: '[AI] The `--flag gum filter --header.height` is a command used in tools like `jq`, a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. This specific flag is used to apply a filter named `gum` to the JSON data, which is assumed to be stored as standard input (`-`). The `--header.height` parameter specifies the height of the header in the output. In other words, this command processes JSON data and applies a custom filter called `gum`, while setting the output''s header height according to the provided value.'
        header.italic: '[AI] The `gum filter --header.italic` command is used in Bash scripting to apply an italic format to the headers of table outputs generated by the `gum` package. The `gum filter` is a filter for formatting and transforming data streams, while the `--header.italic` option sets the header text to be displayed in italic style. In other words, it makes the headers stand out visually when displaying tabular data.'
        header.margin: '[AI] The `gum filter --header.margin` command is used in Git Unified Model (Gum) to modify the display margin of header lines in the diff output. Specifically, it sets the width of the left and right margins for header lines such as file names and commit messages in a Git diff or patch. By default, Gum sets this margin to be 72 columns wide, but you can adjust it using this command followed by the desired column width. For example, `gum filter --header.margin=50` would set the left and right margins for header lines to be 50 columns wide each.'
        header.padding: '[AI] The `--flag gum filter` is a command-line option for tools like `curl` or `axios`, which enables real-time JSON output formatting with colorized keys and values. The `--header.padding` flag, when used in combination, adds indentation and padding to make the headers more readable and easier to parse. Together, they help format HTTP request and response headers for better understanding and debugging.'
        header.strikethrough: '[AI] The `gum filter --header.strikethrough` is a command used in Zsh (Z Shell) or Bash (Bash Shell) to apply a strikethrough effect to the headers of the output of a `git` command. It''s a combination of `gum`, a terminal rendering library, and `filter`, which is a Git extension for applying filters to Git output. The specific flag `--header.strikethrough` instructs this filter to display header lines with a strikethrough effect, making it easier to visually distinguish between headers and regular text in the Git log or other Git outputs.'
        header.underline: '[AI] The `gum filter` is a command in the GNU UnxUtils package used for filtering text streams, specifically for handling compressed or non-text data. The option `--header.underline` creates an underlined line below each header line in the output of the filter. This can be useful when displaying tables with distinct header rows for better visual separation.'
        header.width: '[AI] The `--header.width` option in the `gum filter` command is used to specify the width of the headers in characters when displaying the output of a filtered command or stream. This can be useful for ensuring that headers align properly when dealing with large or wide output. For example, if you''re using `gum filter cat --header.width 50 < file.txt`, the headers of each line in `file.txt` will have a width of 50 characters.'
        height: '[AI] The `gum filter --height` command is related to GUM (Graphical User Interface for Unix-like Systems) and specifically its filter functionality. This command sets the height of the display area for filters, which determines how many lines of text or data are shown in the output at a time. For example, `gum filter --height 20` would set the height to display 20 lines at once.'
        indicator: '[AI] The `--indicator` flag for the `grep` command with the `gum` filter is used to display a progress indicator during the search operation. This can be helpful when working on large files or complex search queries, as it provides visual feedback that the command is still running and processing data. The `gum` filter is an enhanced interface for `grep`, providing features like real-time results, autocomplete suggestions, and a user-friendly interface.'
        indicator.align: '[AI] The `gum filter --indicator.align` is a command used in GNU UnxUtils'' `grep` utility with the `ag-grid` library for text filtering in grid data. This command sets the alignment of the filter indicator, which indicates the state of the active filter, to align with the left edge of the filter column. This ensures proper visual alignment and makes it easier to identify the applied filters within the grid view.'
        indicator.background: '[AI] The `--indicator.background` flag in the `gum filter` command is used to set the background color for status indicators displayed during the execution of a Git command using GUM (Git Understanding Made Easy) library. By default, these indicators have a transparent background, but this flag allows you to specify a different background color if desired. For example, `--indicator.background red` would make all indicators display on a red background.'
        indicator.bold: '[AI] The command `gum filter --indicator.bold` is used in Bash scripting with the Gum package for interactive text filtering and prompting. This specific command sets the indicator text to be displayed in bold format when using filters or prompts.

It accepts a numerical value in pixels, and adjusts the width accordingly. For example, using `--indicator.width 50` sets the indicator width to 50 pixels.'
        limit: '[AI] The `gum filter --limit` command is a part of the GUM (GNU Unified Modeling Language) filtering language in GNU Grep. This command sets a limit on the number of matching lines that are displayed or processed by subsequent filters in a pipeline. For instance, `grep ''pattern'' file | gum filter --limit 10` will show only the first 10 lines that match the given pattern from the input file. This can be useful for processing large files where you only need to examine a small subset of the matching data.'
        match.align: |-
            [AI] The `gum filter --match.align` command is a part of the Genomic Mapping Units (gum) tool in the BCFtools package from the SAMtools suite. This filter is used to select alignment records based on their alignment score or mapping quality.

            The `--match.align` option specifies that only alignments will be processed by the filter. The `--match` flag followed by a number (e.g., `--match 5`) sets a minimum threshold for the number of reads supporting an alignment, while `--align-filtergq <QUAL>` sets a minimum quality score (QUAL) for the alignment's base quality. In this context, `--match.align --filter gq <QUAL>` is used to set both the minimum read support and base quality threshold simultaneously.

            Therefore, the command `gum filter --match.align --filter gq <QUAL>` selects only high-quality alignments with sufficient read support (based on the value of `<QUAL>`).
        match.background: |-
            [AI] The `grep` command with the flag `--match-background` and option `--match` is used to perform a regular expression search in a file or input, but instead of printing matching lines, it highlights the matched parts within each line by displaying them in reverse video mode.

            The `gum filter` argument refers to an external tool named Gum, which is a pager for grep output that provides real-time filtering and interactive navigation capabilities. With this flag, Gum will highlight the matching text as you navigate through the search results.
        match.bold: |-
            [AI] The `grep` command with the flags `--gum` and `--match-file=<filename>` (often written as shorthand `--match` followed by `--bold`) is used for searching text files for regular expression patterns.

            The `--gum` flag enables an interactive pager mode where each match is highlighted in the output. The `--match-file` flag tells `grep` to search for lines containing the pattern found in the specified file, rather than providing the pattern as a separate argument. The `--bold` option makes grep display the matched text in bold in the terminal.
        match.border: |-
            [AI] The `grep` command's `--filter` option is used to apply a test on each file in a directory, and only process the files that match the test. The `gum filter` is not a built-in `grep` filter but an external filter provided by a tool like `gum`.

            The `--match.border` option is a specific filter used with `gum`. It matches lines where the text matched by a regular expression is located exactly at the border between two fields in CSV format (comma-separated values). In other words, it checks if the matched text is separated by commas from the surrounding data.
        match.border-background: '[AI] The `gum filter --match.border-background` is a command in the GUM (GNU Unix Utilities) toolset, specifically the `gumdiff` utility. This filter is used to highlight differences between two files or sets of data that only affect the background color of border regions. When applied to the output of `gumdiff`, it modifies how the visual representation of the differences is displayed, making it easier for users to identify and focus on changes related to border backgrounds.'
        match.border-foreground: '[AI] The `--match.border-foreground` option in the `gum filter` command is used to specify a regular expression pattern for matching the foreground color of borders in text output. When this option is provided along with other filters, only the lines containing borders with the specified foreground color will be processed by the following filters in the pipeline.'
        match.faint: '[AI] The `gum filter --match.faint` is a command used in Astronomy, specifically with the GALAXY evolution and UNiverse MONitoring (GALUMP) software. This command filters the output of astronomical data analysis to only show faint objects or sources, based on their magnitude levels. The `--match.faint` flag sets a threshold for what is considered "faint," typically representing objects with low brightness levels that may be difficult to detect in large data sets.'
        match.foreground: '[AI] The `gum filter --match.foreground` command in PowerShell is used to apply filters in the Git Unified Model (GUM) viewer for PowerShell Git modules. Specifically, this command filters the output to only show changes in the foreground color, meaning it will highlight lines that have been added or modified in the files being compared. The `--match` parameter is used to specify filtering rules, and the `foreground` parameter determines which changes to display in a different color.'
        match.height: '[AI] The `gum filter --match.height` is a command used in Git Bash or Git for Unix to apply filters on git diff output. Specifically, this command filters the diff output to only show changes related to the height of matched lines between two files. In other words, it displays differences that affect the number of lines in matching parts of the files.'
        match.italic: '[AI] The `gum filter --match.italic` is a command used in GitUp (Git for Windows with a Tmux-like interface) to apply filters on text matches within the git diff output. This specific filter, `--match.italic`, highlights italicized text in the diff results. It can help in identifying and focusing on changed or added text that appears in italics within the source code files.'
        match.margin: '[AI] The `gum filter --match.margin` command is used in Git to apply a filter, specifically the `gum` filter, only to lines that match a particular margin pattern in the diff output. The option `--match.margin` allows specifying a regular expression for matching the whitespace before and after each hunk''s changed lines. This can be useful when dealing with files containing large blocks of whitespace or indentation changes. The filter itself, `gum`, is an external tool that provides a more user-friendly interface to review and edit diff hunks.'
        match.padding: |-
            [AI] The `gum filter --match.padding` command is used in Git Large File Storage (LFS) with the Git Unified Modeling Language (GUM) filtering system. It filters files that have large binary contents, which are tracked by Git LFS and not directly in the Git repository.

            The `--match.padding` option specifically tells Git LFS to include leading or trailing whitespace, also known as padding, when filtering files. This means that if a text file contains leading or trailing whitespace, it will be preserved during the Git LFS filtering process and won't be stripped out unintentionally.
        match.strikethrough: |-
            [AI] The `grep` command with the flags `--gum` and `--match-strikethrough` is used for searching text in a file or input stream.

            `--gum` flag enables the interactive pager mode where the output is displayed one page at a time, allowing users to search for specific patterns using visual cues like highlighting.

            The `--match-strikethrough` flag adds strikethrough text styling to the matching lines in addition to the standard highlighting provided by the `--gum` flag. This makes it easier for users to visually identify and compare the context of the matches with the surrounding text.
        match.underline: |-
            [AI] The `grep` command with the flags `--gum` and `--match-output=.<variable>` is used for searching text in files or input streams.

            The `--gum` flag enables the display of color-coded matched lines in the terminal, making it easier to identify matching results. The `--match-output=.<variable>` flag specifies that only the matched parts of each line should be printed and stored into the variable named `<variable>`.

            So, the command `grep --gum --match-output=.<out> <pattern> <file_or_input>` searches for lines in a file or input stream containing the specified pattern (`<pattern>`) and only displays the matching parts of each line while colorizing the entire line. The matched parts are stored into the variable `<out>`.
        match.width: '[AI] The `gum filter --match.width` command is used in Elastic''s Logstash data processing pipeline to filter events based on a specific width of a particular field''s value, which is specified by the `--match.width` option. In simpler terms, it filters logs where the given field''s length matches the defined width.'
        no-limit: '[AI] The `gum filter --no-limit` command is a data processing instruction used in AstroPy''s GUM (Galactic Usable Maps) package for handling large sky surveys. The `--no-limit` flag disables any limit on the amount of data processed or stored. This can be useful when dealing with vast datasets where memory limitations are not a concern. By default, GUM processes data in chunks due to computational and memory efficiency considerations; however, setting `--no-limit` allows for processing the entire dataset at once. Note that this operation may require significant resources and time.'
        placeholder: |-
            [AI] The `--placeholder` option is not a valid flag for the `gum filter` command in Node.js or other similar contexts. The `gum filter` command is typically used with filters, each represented by a specific flag followed by options and arguments as necessary. For example:

            ```bash
            gum filter jshint --silent
            ```

            In this case, `jshint` is the name of the filter to apply. The `--silent` option suppresses output from warnings and errors. There's no widely-used `--placeholder` flag for `gum filter`. If you meant something else by that term, please clarify and I'll do my best to help!
        prompt: '[AI] The `--prompt` flag for the `gum` filter in PowerShell is used to specify a custom prompt string that will be displayed before each new command or input line in the console. This can help users keep track of their commands and sessions, especially in lengthy scripts or complex workflows. For example, setting `--prompt ''MyCustomPrompt$>'' would display `MyCustomPrompt$>` before each new line in the PowerShell console.'
        prompt.align: '[AI] The `--prompt.align` flag in the `gum` CLI filter is used to align multi-line prompts when piping input and output between different command-line tools. It ensures that the prompts of consecutive commands are displayed at the same indentation level, making the output look cleaner and more organized in the terminal.'
        prompt.background: '[AI] The `--prompt.background gum filter` is a command used in PowerShell and other terminal applications that runs the Gum Prompt Theme engine filter to customize the appearance of the PowerShell prompt.

        reverse: |-
            [AI] The `gum filter --reverse` command is a data manipulation command used in Unix-like operating systems, specifically within the context of the GUM (GNU Unxutils) package. This command reads input data and applies the reverse filter to each line separately.

            In more detail, the `--reverse` option reverses the order of bytes in each line, while the `gum filter` part specifies that this is being done with a filter, which is a small program used for processing text streams. The effect is that the command reads data line by line, and outputs the reverse of each line back to the output stream.
        select-if-one: '[AI] The `gum filter --select-if-one` is a command used in Git Large File Storage (LFS) to select and download only one version of a large file that has multiple versions in the Git LFS history. The `--select-if-one` option ensures that only the latest or the first version of the file is retrieved, effectively filtering out the need to download other versions. This can save bandwidth and time when dealing with large repositories containing many versions of large files.'
        selected-indicator.align: '[AI] The `gum filter --selected-indicator.align` is a command in Git Updates Manager (Gum) that configures the alignment of selected indicator within the Git UI. It does not directly apply filters to data, but instead affects how indicators for selected items are displayed. The exact behavior can depend on the specific Git UI being used with Gum, as each may have its own interpretation of "align" for the selected indicator.'
        selected-indicator.background: '[AI] The `--gum-filter` flag with the argument `"--selected-indicator.background"` is used in command-line interfaces, typically in tools like Fish or PowerShell, to apply a specific filter to items that are currently selected.

        selected-prefix: '[AI] The `gum filter --selected-prefix` command in Git is used to apply a GUM (Git Usage Minimizer) filter with the selected prefix as an argument. This means that only Git commands beginning with the specified prefix will be affected by the filter. For instance, if you run `gum filter --selected-prefix git push`, then only Git "push" commands will be modified or replaced by GUM filters defined in your configuration file (e.g., ~/.config/gumrc). This can help streamline and customize your Git usage.'
        sort: |-
            [AI] The command `gum filter --sort` is used with the GUM (Grep Usage Minimizer) tool in Linux. It applies a filter to the output of a grep command, and then sorts the results based on some criteria, such as alphabetical order or numerical value.

            Here's a breakdown of each part of the command:

            1. `gum`: This invokes the GUM tool.
            2. `filter`: This is the command to apply a filter to the output of another command.
            3. `--sort`: This option sorts the filtered output based on some criteria, such as `-n` for numerical sort or `-k1` followed by a letter for alphabetical sort based on the first column. For example, `--sort -k1` will sort the output by the first column in alphabetical order.

            So, `gum filter --sort` alone might not do much, but when combined with other commands and options like `grep` and `--sort-key`, it can be used to process and organize command line output in a more efficient way.
        strict: '[AI] The `--strict` flag in the `gum filter` command is an option that enforces strict validation rules when processing input data. This means that if any record or field in the input does not conform to the expected format, the entire filtering process will fail and no records will be processed further. By using `--strict`, you ensure that only perfectly formatted data passes through the filter, enhancing the overall data quality and accuracy of downstream processes.'
        text.align: |-
            [AI] The `gum filter --text.align` command is used in Git Bash, a Unix-like environment for Windows, to apply text alignment filters with Gum, a popular terminal paste and text manipulation tool.

            Specifically, the `--text.align` option aligns the pasted or piped text based on its columns (left, right, center) as specified by the user. For instance, `gum filter --text.align=right` would right-align the text when pasting or piping it into the terminal.
        text.background: '[AI] The `--text.background` flag in the `gum` CLI filter command is used to set the background color of the text output. When this option is provided with a value, the filter will display its output with that specified background color. If no value is given, the default background color is transparent. This flag does not change the appearance of the input text itself but only the background color behind it.'
        text.bold: |-
            [AI] The `--flag "gum filter" --text.bold` is a command or option used with certain text editing or processing tools, such as Git or Markdown processors. This specific combination of flags has the following meanings:

            * `--flag "gum filter"`: Applies a filter or transformation to the text using Gum, a CLI tool for editing and transforming text streams. The exact nature of the filter depends on how it is defined and configured in Gum.
            * `--text.bold`: Formats the selected text in bold format. In contexts like Markdown or Git commit messages, this can be used to make specific words or phrases stand out visually.
        text.border: '[AI] The `--flag "gum filter --text.border"` is a command-line option used with GNU Parallel to apply the `gum filter` to text output with added borders around each line of text for better visualization. This can be useful when processing large data sets or scripts that produce textual outputs in a more organized and distinguishable way. The flag `--text.border` is responsible for enabling the border feature.'
        text.border-background: '[AI] The `gum filter --text.border-background` command is used in Git Bash (a Unix-like environment for Windows) with the Git tool `gum` for interactive git prompts. This specific command sets the background color of text borders displayed by gum filters, which are customizable graphical interfaces for various Git commands. When invoked, it changes the border''s background color without affecting other aspects of the terminal appearance.'
        text.border-foreground: '[AI] The `--flag "gum filter" --text.border-foreground` is a command option for GUM (Generic Utilities for Mansions), a popular Git hook management tool. This flag enables the use of GUM filters, which are custom scripts to modify or validate Git commit messages. The `--text.border-foreground` modifier changes the color of the border around text in the filter output to the foreground. In summary, this option configures GUM to apply filters with a colored border on their text output.'
        text.faint: |-
            [AI] The `gum filter --text.faint` command is related to the `grep` utility in Unix-like operating systems. It's not a single flag but rather a combination of two flags:

            1. `--text`: This flag instructs `grep` to process the input data as plain text, ignoring any line breaks or special characters that might be treated as new records or fields if the data is in a different format like CSV or tab-separated values.

            2. `--faint`: This flag modifies the output of `grep`. When used with `--text`, it results in minimal, monochrome output. The terminal will display the matching text without any color or other non-textual attributes. This can be useful when working in a terminal-based environment where color might not be supported or preferred for various reasons.
        text.foreground: '[AI] The `--text.foreground` option in the `gum filter` command is used to specify the foreground color for text output displayed in the terminal. It takes a valid color name or hexadecimal code as an argument. When you pipe output from one command to `gum filter` with this option, the filtered text will be displayed in the specified color.'
        text.height: '[AI] The `gum filter --text.height` command is a part of GUM (GNU Unix-utils), a text processing filter in the UNIX ecosystem. This specific command processes text and sets the height of each line of text to be exactly `HEIGHT` characters, trimming any excess whitespace or content beyond that length. The input text is read from standard input (STDIN), and the output is written to standard output (STDOUT). It can also take an optional filename argument for reading input from a file instead. This command is useful when dealing with text where uniform line lengths are desired, such as in scripts or config files.'
        text.italic: '[AI] The `gum filter --text.italic` is a command used in the GUM (Graphical User Meeting) shell for Unix-based systems. It applies an italic text filter to the specified text that follows this command. In other words, it makes the text appear italicized when displayed on the terminal or in the output of a script or pipeline.'
        text.margin: '[AI] The `gum filter --text.margin` command is used in Git Bash, a terminal for Git version control system. This command invokes the GUM (Git Utilities for Mac) package filter with the argument `--text.margin`, which configures the text display settings in Git. Specifically, it sets the margin size for text output to be displayed in the terminal. A larger margin value results in more whitespace between the text and the terminal border, making the output easier to read when the text is long or wraps around multiple lines.'
        text.padding: '[AI] The `gum filter --text.padding` command in Git is used to apply text padding to the output of a Git filter. This means that the filter will add characters before or after the text it processes, increasing its length without modifying its content. The flag `--text` specifies that the filter should be applied to plain text data, while `--padding` indicates that the filter will add padding. The exact format and characters of the padding can be specified using additional options with this command.'
        text.strikethrough: '[AI] The `gum filter --text.strikethrough` is a command used in the Git Ultimate Mercure (Git-Lab Unified Model) (Git) version control system. This command applies the strikethrough text format filter to selected text within a commit message or within files being committed. The filter changes the selected text into strikethrough format, which is displayed as a line of hyphens (-) above and below the text in the Git interface. It''s often used for indicating retracted or removed content during collaboration.'
        text.underline: |-
            [AI] The `--flag "gum filter --text.underline"` is a command-line option used with various text processing tools, such as `sed` or `perl`, to apply underlining formatting to specified text within input data. The exact implementation may depend on the specific tool being used. Generally, it can be broken down into two parts:

            1. `gum filter`: This is likely a reference to an external filter or plugin that provides underlining formatting functionality.
            2. `--text.underline`: This option flag instructs the tool to apply the underlining formatting to the specified text within the input data.
        text.width: |-
            [AI] The `gum filter --text.width` command is used in Git Bash (a Unix-like environment for Windows, based on the Git project) to apply a text filter named `gum` with an optional argument `--text.width`. This argument sets the width of the terminal text display for the filter's output. For instance, if you have long command outputs and want them wrapped at specific columns in your terminal, you can use this command:

            ```bash
            $ git filter-branch --index-filter "gum filter --text.width=80" --tag-name-filter="v*" --prune-empty-commits
            ```

            Here, `gum filter` is the name of the text filter, and `--text.width=80` sets the width to 80 characters. This command will rewrite the Git history (including branches and tags) with the given text filter applied, wrapping long lines at 80 characters.
        timeout: |-
            [AI] The `gum filter --timeout` is a command used in Git Bash, specifically with Gitty (Git for Unix-like shells), to apply filters on file contents during a Git operation while setting a timeout for the filter process.

            The `gum filter` is a Git extension providing an interactive filtering experience with various options and filters. The command `--timeout` sets the time limit in seconds before the filter process gets terminated if it takes longer than expected to prevent potential long-running processes that could impact performance or cause delays.

            For instance, to apply an `aspell` filter with a timeout of 5 seconds, you would use:
            ```bash
            git filter-branch --index-filter 'gum filter branch --script=". filter_script.sh" --timeout 5' --prune --tag --force
            ```
            Replace the script name (`.filter_script.sh`) with your preferred filter script and adjust the timeout value as needed.
        unselected-prefix: '[AI] The `gum filter --unselected-prefix` is a command used in Git Unified Message (Gum) for PowerShell, a Git interface that provides an enhanced user experience. This specific command prefixes unselected changes with an "X-" symbol during a Git commit message review. It helps visualize which hunks or changes have not been selected for inclusion in the commit message by the reviewer. The `--unselected-prefix` option sets the prefix to "X-".'
        unselected-prefix.align: |-
            [AI] The `--gum-filter` option with the argument `--unselected-prefix.align` is used in Bamboo, a continuous integration and delivery tool. This flag is related to the GUM (GitHub Universally Mirrored) data model and filtering.

            The `--unselected-prefix.align` argument specifies an alignment rule for unselected items in a list or table output, where each item has a prefix. The prefix can be of different lengths for each item. The flag ensures that the unselected items are horizontally aligned based on their prefix length, making the output look cleaner and easier to read.
        unselected-prefix.background: |-
            [AI] The `gum` flag `--unselected-prefix.background` is used in Git bash or Git for Unix scripts to customize the appearance of unselected branches or commits in the output of git commands like `git branch` or `git log`.

            The prefix is usually represented by an asterisk (*) for selected branches and a caret (^) for remote tracking branches. This flag modifies the background color of these prefixes, typically setting them to stand out against the terminal background, making it easier to visually distinguish between selected and unselected items in the output.
        unselected-prefix.bold: '[AI] The `gum` flag `--unselected-prefix.bold` is used to make the prefix of unselected options in `gum` prompts appear in bold text when displayed in the terminal. This can help distinguish between selected and unselected options during user interaction with command-line applications built using `gum`.'
        unselected-prefix.border: '[AI] The `gum` flag `--unselected-prefix.border` is used in Git Unified Model (GUM) for filtering output. Specifically, it adds a border around the hunks or files that do not have any selected changes (i.e., unchanged or deleted lines). This visual differentiation helps users identify and focus on the parts of the diff where changes occurred.'
        unselected-prefix.border-background: '[AI] The `--gum-filter` option in a Git command is used to apply filters during the git diff output. Specifically, `--gum-filter "gum filter" --unselected-prefix.border-background` sets up a custom GUM (Git Unified Model) filter named `gum filter`. This filter modifies the appearance of unselected changes by applying a border-background to their diff output in the Git terminal interface.'
        unselected-prefix.border-foreground: |-
            [AI] The `gum filter --unselected-prefix.border-foreground` is a command used in Git Unified Model (Gum) for Git Bash or PowerShell. This command applies a filter to the Git diff output, specifically modifying unselected changes with a prefix and setting the border foreground color.

            The prefix is typically added to lines that have been modified but not selected for a commit, providing additional context when reviewing changes. The `--unselected-prefix` option enables this feature, while `.border-foreground` sets the color of the border around these unselected lines.
        unselected-prefix.faint: '[AI] The `gum filter --unselected-prefix.faint` is a command used in the GALactic Usher Mapper (GUM) software, specifically for applying filters to astronomical data. This command removes sources from the output that have a faintness value (as specified by the `--unselected-prefix` argument) below a certain threshold, which helps to exclude weak or noisy detections in the resulting map or catalog of astronomical objects.'
        unselected-prefix.foreground: '[AI] The `--gum-filter` option with the argument `--unselected-prefix.foreground=""` is a configuration setting for Git Upgrade Migration Assistant (GUM) in Git. It sets the foreground color of unselected prefixes, which are prefixes that indicate an action or selection but have not been chosen, to none or no color. This means that they will not stand out in the terminal output. The overall effect is to make the selected items clearer against the background by reducing visual noise from the unselected prefixes.'
        unselected-prefix.height: |-
            [AI] The `gum` flag `--unselected-prefix.height` is used in Git Bash or Git for Unix to modify the height of the text displayed before unselected branches in the output of the branch listing command (e.g., `git branch`).

            The prefix is usually "`*`" for the currently checked out branch and "`[`" for other local or remote branches. This flag lets you customize the height of that prefix, allowing for better visibility when dealing with long branch names. For instance, `--unselected-prefix.height 3` sets the height to three characters, making it suitable for shorter branch names.
        unselected-prefix.italic: '[AI] The `gum filter --unselected-prefix.italic` is a command in Git Unified Message (Gum) filtering tool. It''s used to italicize the prefix of unselected items during git commit message interaction. This can help distinguish unselected changes from those that have been selected for commitment.'
        unselected-prefix.margin: '[AI] The `gum filter --unselected-prefix.margin` command is used in Git Bash (Git Unified Model) to apply a filter named `gum` with an option `--unselected-prefix "margin:"`. This option prefixes the labels of unselected items with the given string "margin:" when displaying a list of files or hunks for staging or committing. The flag is helpful in keeping track of which items have been selected or not while working on Git operations.'
        unselected-prefix.padding: |-
            [AI] The `--gum-filter` option with the argument `"--unselected-prefix.padding"` is a command used in Git to modify the output format of the Git status command, specifically for filenames that are not being tracked or have uncommitted changes.

            Here's a breakdown:

            * `--gum-filter`: Enables filtering and formatting of Git output using Gum, which is a library for interactive command line interfaces.
            * `"--unselected-prefix"`: Specifies the prefix to be used when displaying untracked files or files with local changes that are not being tracked by Git.
            * `.padding`: Indicates that the specified prefix should be padded with spaces, allowing for better alignment and readability in the output.

            So, this command sets up Git's status output to display a padding-enabled, distinct prefix for untracked files or local changes that are not being tracked by Git. This makes it easier to visually identify these files when working with your Git repository.
        unselected-prefix.strikethrough: '[AI] The `gum filter --unselected-prefix.strikethrough` is a command used in Git Bash or Git for Windows terminal to apply a strikethrough text format to unselected prefixes when displaying the list of available git commands or branches. This can be helpful to visually distinguish the currently unselected items from the selected ones, improving the user experience and reducing potential confusion during git operations.'
        unselected-prefix.underline: |-
            [AI] The `--gum-filter` option with the argument `"--unselected-prefix.underline"` is used in Git for formatting the output of git commands, specifically when dealing with branch names.

            With this flag, any branch name that is not currently selected (i.e., not checked out) will be underlined in the output. This can be helpful when working with multiple branches and wanting to quickly identify which ones are currently active versus which ones are not.
        unselected-prefix.width: '[AI] The `gum` flag `--unselected-prefix.width` is used in Git to configure the width of the prefix displayed for unselected branches or commits in a list. For example, when using the `git branch` command, by default, only selected branches have an asterisk (*) symbol before their names. Unselected branches display with a colon (:) followed by their names. This flag sets the number of columns used to display the prefix for unselected items. So, if set to a value of 3, the prefix for unselected branches would be displayed as "::" followed by the branch name, taking up three columns in the output.'
        value: '[AI] The `--value` option in the `gum filter` command is used to specify a specific value that a filter should output when executed. Gum filters are custom scripts or functions that can be used with the Git Unified Modeling language (Git-Lint, Husky, etc.) to perform various checks and transformations on Git files during the commit process. When using the `--value` option, the filter will return the provided value instead of its usual output, making it useful for enforcing specific values or behaviors in your workflow.'
        width: '[AI] The `--width` option in the `gum filter` command is used to specify the width of the terminal window for the output of the filter. It''s a parameter passed to some filters within the Gum package for Node.js, which allows users to apply various transformations to text or streams. Setting an appropriate width helps ensure that the filtered output fits well on the user''s terminal screen.'
