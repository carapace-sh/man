documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tofu workspace new` is a command used in Tofu, a Git-based data management system. This command creates a new Tofu workspace with an empty Git repository. When you run this command in your terminal, it initializes a new Git repository and sets up the necessary Tofu configuration files within that directory. You can then use Tofu to manage and track changes to data files within this workspace.'
    flag:
        lock: '[AI] `tofu workspace new -lock` is a command used in Tofu, a Git-based data management tool. This command creates a new workspace with an initial commit and immediately locks it to prevent other users from modifying the workspace concurrently. The lock ensures data consistency while multiple users collaborate on different workspaces based on the same repository.'
        lock-timeout: '[AI] The `tofu workspace new -lock-timeout` command in Tofu, a Git workflow management tool, creates a new workspace with a specified lock timeout. This flag sets the maximum duration that a lock on the workspace can be held before it is released automatically to prevent long-term blocking of other users attempting to use the same workspace. The time is typically set in minutes. If no `-lock-timeout` flag is provided, Tofu uses a default value or no timeout at all, depending on the configuration.'
        state: '[AI] The command `tofu workspace new -state` is used to create a new Tofu workspace in the Terraform configuration management tool, setting its initial state to be empty. Tofu workspaces are a feature that allows managing multiple isolated configurations within a single Terraform working directory. By using the `-state` flag with the `new` command, you''re indicating that a new, unsaved, empty state file will be created for the newly generated workspace.'
