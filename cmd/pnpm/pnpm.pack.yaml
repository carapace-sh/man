documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pnpm pack` is a command used in the PNPM package manager for creating a new, production-ready archive (also called bundle or package) from the source files of an existing project or package in Node.js. It builds and optimizes the project based on its `pnpm-workspace.yaml` or `package.json` file and generates a `.tgz` file containing the compiled code and necessary metadata for distribution and dependency management.'
    flag:
        pack-destination: '[AI] `pnpm pack --pack-destination` is a command provided by pnpm, a package manager for JavaScript projects. This command is used to create an archived (tarball or zip) distribution of a specific project and save it as a custom scope package in the local pnpm registry. The `--pack-destination` option allows specifying a local directory path where the packaged distribution will be saved. This can be useful for creating and sharing custom packages within an organization without publishing them to a public registry like npm or yarn.'
