        select: '[AI] `i3-scrot --select` is a command used in the i3 window manager for Linux systems to take a screenshot of a specific selection or a window, rather than the entire screen. The `--select` option specifies that only the selected region or window should be captured in the screenshot. When executed, this command will open a cursor, allowing the user to draw a box around the desired area by clicking and dragging, releasing the mouse button to confirm the selection. Once confirmed, i3-scrot will save the screenshot as a PNG file with a default filename containing the current date and time.'
        window: '[AI] The `i3-scrot --window` command is used in the i3 window manager to take a screenshot of an individual open window instead of the entire desktop. The `--window` option specifies that only the current focused window should be captured in the screenshot, making it helpful when you want to save a specific application''s output or UI as an image file.'
