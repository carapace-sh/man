documentation:
    command: '[AI] "clamdtop" is a command-line tool used to monitor and display statistics about the Clam Antivirus daemon (clamd). It provides real-time information on various aspects of clamd''s performance, such as the number of scanned files, scanning speed, memory usage, and virus definition updates. This data can be helpful for system administrators to optimize and troubleshoot their antivirus solution. By default, it displays the output in a tabular format and continuously updates it to reflect real-time information.'
    flag:
        config-file: |-
            [AI] `clamav-daemon` is an antivirus software used to scan files and email messages in real time. The `--config-file` option is a command-line argument for the `clamdscan` or `clamdtop` utility, which comes with the ClamAV package. This argument specifies the path to the configuration file for customizing various aspects of the ClamAV scanning process.

            For instance, in the context of `clamdtop`, it is used to display real-time statistics about running scans and their results. By providing the `--config-file` option followed by the path to a valid ClamAV configuration file, you can customize what data `clamdtop` displays or even change other settings related to the scanning process.

            Using this command:
            ```bash
            clamdtop --config-file /path/to/your/custom/clamav.conf
            ```
            will make clamdtop use your customized configuration file located at `/path/to/your/custom/clamav.conf`. This file can contain various directives and settings to customize the behavior of ClamAV.
        defaultcolors: '[AI] `clamdtop` is a command-line utility for monitoring and managing the ClamAV antivirus daemon, `clamd`. The option `--defaultcolors` changes the colors used by `clamdtop` to be the default colors defined by the terminal or terminal emulator. It does not alter the functionality of `clamdtop`, but makes its output more visually distinguishable based on the user''s preference for color-coding in their terminal.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `clamdtop` is a command-line tool for displaying real-time statistics about the ClamAV antivirus daemon, `clamav-daemon`.
