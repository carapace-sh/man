    command: '[AI] "Conky" is a free and open-source, highly configurable system monitor for the X Window System. It can display various system statistics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, and weather information, among others, in the form of graphical widgets or text on the desktop or in the terminal. Users can customize its appearance and functionality through configuration files. Conky runs continuously in the background and updates the displayed data in real-time.'
    flag:
        alignment: |-
            [AI] `conky --alignment` is an option used with Conky, a graphical system monitoring tool for the Linux desktop. This option determines how the output of Conky is aligned on the screen. The possible values are:

            * `l` (left): Aligns the output to the left of the monitor.
            * `c` (center): Centers the output on the monitor.
            * `r` (right): Aligns the output to the right of the monitor.

            By default, Conky does not have any alignment and will be placed at the location specified in its configuration file.
        config: '[AI] `conky --config` is a command used in Linux to configure the Conky window manager, which is a highly flexible and powerful system monitoring tool. The `--config` option is followed by a filename containing Conky configuration settings written in its own custom language. These settings define various aspects of Conky''s appearance and functionality, such as monitors to be used, layout, colors, fonts, and the types of information to be displayed (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, network statistics). The provided configuration file is parsed and loaded by Conky at start-up, allowing users to customize its behavior to suit their preferences and system monitoring needs.'
        daemonize: '[AI] `conky --daemonize` is a command-line option used with Conky, a popular system monitoring tool for Linux desktop environments. This option instructs Conky to run as a background service or daemon after being started. It keeps the monitoring process running even when a user logs out or closes the terminal window where it was initially executed. This is particularly useful if you want Conky to start automatically during system boot, or if you prefer to keep it running continuously in the background without having an open terminal window for it.'
        debug: '[AI] `conky --debug` is a command used to start the Conky window manager with debug mode enabled. This mode provides more detailed output and can help in diagnosing issues or understanding the behavior of Conky. The debug messages are typically displayed in the terminal, providing information about various aspects of Conky''s execution such as configuration parsing, module loading, and drawing operations.'
        display: '[AI] The `--display` option in Conky, a popular system monitoring tool for Linux desktop environments, specifies the X11 display or monitor where Conky should be drawn. It takes as its argument the name or identifier of the display or a list of displays if running on a multi-monitor setup. For example, `--display :0` refers to the first display or `--display HDMI-0 1920x1080` sets the resolution for the HDMI output at 1920x1080 pixels. The primary goal is to ensure Conky runs on the intended display.'
        double-buffer: '[AI] The `--double-buffer` option in Conky is used to enable double buffering. Double buffering is a technique that improves the visual display of Conky by rendering the new frame off-screen, reducing flicker and improving performance, especially on systems with high refresh rates or complex configurations. When enabled, Conky will draw each frame to a temporary buffer before swapping it with the previous frame on the screen.'
        font: '[AI] `conky --font` is a command-line option used with Conky, a graphical system monitoring tool for Linux and BSD systems. This option sets the font family and size for text displayed by Conky. For example, `--font "Monospace 12"` would set the font to Monospace with a size of 12 pixels. Multiple fonts can be specified in case different parts of the output require different fonts. The goal is to customize the appearance of the monitoring information provided by Conky.'
        help: '[AI] `conky --help` is a command used in Linux to display the help information for Conky, a graphical system monitoring tool. When executed with this option, it provides a brief explanation of Conky''s usage and options. It explains how to configure and run Conky scripts, along with a list of available configuration variables and their functions. This helps users understand how to effectively use Conky to monitor various system statistics.'
        i: '[AI] The `-i` option in Conky, a system monitoring tool for Linux and BSD, stands for "interactive." When used, it enables user interactions with the Conky configuration file through the mouse or keyboard. This allows users to dynamically modify the appearance and content of their Conky widget without having to edit the configuration file directly.'
        interval: '[AI] The `--interval` option in Conky is used to set the time interval between two consecutive script executions or updates. It takes an argument representing the number of seconds, minutes, hours, or any combination thereof to wait before the next execution. This option helps manage system resources by reducing the frequency of script checks and minimizing the impact on system performance.'
        own-window: '[AI] `conky --own-window` is a command line argument used with Conky, a graphical system monitoring tool for the Linux desktop environment. This option makes Conky create a new, top-level X11 window instead of attaching to an existing one. When using `--own-window`, Conky runs as a standalone application and can be moved, resized, and managed independently from other windows in the desktop environment.'
        pause: '[AI] `conky --pause` is a command-line option used with Conky, a popular system monitoring tool for Linux and BSD desktop environments. This option instructs Conky to pause its configuration updates and ongoing monitoring process. It can be useful when troubleshooting or making changes to your Conky configuration files without disrupting the real-time monitoring of system statistics. Once you''re satisfied with the modifications, simply restart Conky without using the `--pause` flag for the changes to take effect.'
        print-config: '[AI] The `conky --print-config` command is used in Conky, a popular system monitoring tool for Linux and BSD systems. This command is used to display the current configuration of the running Conky instance. It prints out all the settings, variables, and customizations that have been applied to the Conky script, helping users understand and modify its behavior. The output can be saved or redirected to a file for future reference.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `conky` command with the `--quiet` option is used to run Conky, a system monitoring tool for X, without displaying any output on the terminal. This option is useful when running Conky as a background process or in scripts where you don''t need to see the real-time monitoring output.'
        text: '[AI] `conky --text` is a command-line option used with Conky, a flexible and powerful system monitoring tool for Linux and other Unix systems. With this option, Conky is run in text mode instead of graphical mode, displaying output directly on the terminal screen as plain text, rather than creating a graphical window. The text output can be configured using Conky''s customizable configuration files to show various system statistics, clocks, weather information, and other data.'
        version: '[AI] `conky --version` is a command used in Linux and Unix-based systems to display the version information of Conky, a free, lightweight, and highly configurable system monitoring tool. When executed in a terminal or console window, it returns the current version number and build details of the installed Conky software.'
        window-id: '[AI] The `--window-id` option in Conky, a popular system monitoring tool for Linux, is used to specify the ID of a particular X11 window to attach the Conky configuration to. When this option is set, Conky will not create its own separate window but instead be drawn on the specified window''s background. This can be useful when you want to monitor system information directly within other applications, such as file managers or text editors.'
        x: '[AI] The `-x` option in Conky is used to force Conky to run in X11 mode, which means it will be displayed as a graphical widget on your desktop environment or window manager. In other words, it tells Conky to create a window and draw its output there, rather than just outputting text to the console.'
        xinerama-head: '[AI] The `--xinerama-head` option in Conky is used to configure Conky to run on a multi-head X server setup, where multiple displays are connected to a single computer. With this option, Conky will be able to identify and use the primary display head as its drawing surface, ensuring that the output is correctly displayed across all connected monitors according to their physical arrangement in the Xinerama configuration.'
        "y": '[AI] The `-y` flag in Conky, a system monitoring tool for Linux desktops, is used to force Conky to output text in vertical alignment. By default, Conky arranges its output in horizontal alignment. With the `-y` flag, each new line or widget starts below the previous one, stacking up vertically instead of horizontally. This can be useful for creating a columnar layout with multiple widgets or information streams.'
