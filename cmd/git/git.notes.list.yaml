documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git notes list` is a Git command used to display a list of all annotated notes (also known as "tagged notes") in the current repository. Annotated notes are similar to tags but store arbitrary key-value pairs along with a message and a tag. This command shows the note names, the messages associated with them, and other relevant information such as the tag object name and the creation date.'
