    command: |-
        [AI] The `git notes remove` command is used to delete a note in Git. Notes are annotated tags that can be used to store arbitrary data along with a commit. To remove a note, you would use the following syntax:

        ```bash
        git notes delete <note-tag>
        ```

        Replace `<note-tag>` with the tag name of the note you want to delete. Once you run this command, Git will permanently delete the specified note tag and its associated data.
    flag:
        ignore-missing: '[AI] The `git notes remove --ignore-missing` command is used to delete notes in Git, which are annotations or messages attached to specific commits. The `--ignore-missing` option tells Git to proceed with the operation even if some of the referenced commits are missing or not found. This can be useful when working with large repositories or when dealing with commits that have been force-deleted or rewritten, as it allows you to remove notes without having to first locate and retrieve all the associated commits.'
        stdin: '[AI] `git notes remove --stdin` is a Git command used to remove notes stored in the Git system''s note store. The `--stdin` option allows you to pass notes to be removed via standard input, making it useful when dealing with a large number of notes or when notes are listed in a script output. When you pipe or redirect the output of a Git command that lists notes into this command, each note is removed as it is read from standard input.'
