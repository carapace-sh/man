name: kill [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]
description: Kill one or more running containers
flags:
    -s, --signal=: Signal to send to the container
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker container kill` is a command used to forcibly stop and terminate one or more running Docker containers based on their container ID or name. It sends a SIGKILL signal (ungraceful shutdown) to the container processes, causing them to be stopped immediately without any grace period for saving data or performing orderly shutdown procedures. This command is typically used when you need to terminate a container forcefully due to unresponsiveness or other critical situations where waiting for a normal stop is not an option.'
    flag:
        signal: '[AI] The `docker container kill` command is used to send a signal to one or more running Docker containers to stop and terminate them. The `--signal` option allows specifying the type of signal to send, with common signals including `SIGTERM` (default) or `SIGKILL`. A signal is a method for sending an unambiguous message to a process to request that it stop its execution. `SIGTERM` sends a graceful termination request, allowing the container to clean up and exit in an orderly fashion, while `SIGKILL` forces immediate termination, bypassing any attempts at graceful shutdown.'
