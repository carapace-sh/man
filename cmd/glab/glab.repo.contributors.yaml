    command: '[AI] The `glab` command `repo contributors` is used with GitLab CLI (Command Line Interface) to list down all the users who have contributed to a specific repository by making commits, creating merge requests, or reviewing changes. This command helps in identifying the active members and their contributions to the project.'
    flag:
        order: '[AI] `glab repo contributors --order` is a command used in GitLab''s CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool, Glab. This command lists all the contributors to a specific GitLab repository, ordering the output by some criterion. The `--order` option specifies how the list should be sorted: it can take values like "alphabetically", "reverse alphabetically", or other options based on the number of contributions, such as "most" (for most contributions) or "least" (for least contributions).'
        page: '[AI] `glab repo contributors --page` is a GitLab CLI command used to list the top contributors of a specific GitLab repository based on the number of commits they have made. The `--page` option allows you to navigate through multiple pages of results, displaying only a specified number of items per page. This command helps in identifying active developers and their contributions within the given repository.'
        per-page: '[AI] The `glab repo contributors --per-page` command is a GitLab CLI (Command Line Interface) tool provided by Glab, an unofficial GitLab client for Git. This command is used to list the number of contributions made by each contributor to a specific GitLab repository in pages. The `--per-page` option sets the maximum number of contributions displayed per page. For instance, running `glab repo contributors <repository_URL> --per-page 10` will return the top 10 contributors'' details along with their respective contribution numbers. This command is helpful when dealing with large repositories with numerous contributors and provides a convenient way to view contributions data in manageable chunks.'
        sort: |-
            [AI] The `glab repo contributors --sort` command is used with GitLab's CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, Glab, to list the contributors for a specific repository in descending order based on their total number of commits.

            Here's a breakdown:

            1. `glab`: It is GitLab's official command-line interface tool.
            2. `repo`: The command specifies that you want to work with a repository.
            3. `contributors`: This subcommand lists the users who have made commits to the repository.
            4. `--sort`: The option sorts the list based on the specified criterion, which in this case is total number of commits (default is alphabetical order).
