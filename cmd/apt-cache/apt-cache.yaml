    command: '[AI] `apt-cache` is a utility in Debian-based Linux distributions for interacting with the package indexes. It allows users to search, retrieve metadata about packages (such as their dependencies and descriptions), and verify if a new version of a package is available without installing it. Commonly used commands include `apt-cache search <keyword>` to find packages that match a given keyword in their names or descriptions, `apt-cache show <package-name>` to display detailed information about a specific package, and `apt-cache policy <package-name>` to view the version, installation status, and availability of updates for a package.'
    flag:
        all-names: '[AI] `apt-cache --all-names` is a command used with APT (Advanced Package Tool), which is a package manager for Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions. The `--all-names` option asks apt-cache to retrieve a list of all available packages names in the system''s repositories, without installing or updating them. This command is useful when you need to search for a specific package name or want to see the full list of packages available for installation.'
        all-versions: '[AI] `apt-cache --all-versions` is a command used with APT (Advanced Package Tool), which is a package manager for Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions. The `--all-versions` option instructs apt-cache to retrieve information about all available versions of a particular package in the local package index or repositories, rather than just the latest version. This can be useful when you need to check which older versions of a package are available, for example, before upgrading or downgrading a package.'
        config-file: '[AI] `apt-cache` is a command-line tool in Debian-based Linux distributions for interacting with the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) repository index files. The `--config-file` option is used to specify an alternative APT configuration file instead of the default one located at `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/*` and `/etc/apt/apt.conf`. This can be useful when working with multiple configurations or when using a customized configuration for a specific task. The specified configuration file should conform to the Debian APT config format, which allows defining sources, repositories, and other APT settings.'
        full: '[AI] `apt-cache --full` is a command used with APT (Advanced Package Tool), which is a package management system in Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions. The `--full` option instructs `apt-cache` to download and index all available metadata about packages, including their dependencies and descriptions from the repositories. This data can then be searched or retrieved using other APT commands. It is often used when an upgrade or installation of software requires resolving complex dependency issues or when working offline.'
        generate: '[AI] `apt-cache --generate` is a command used with APT (Advanced Package Tool), which is a package manager for Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions. The `--generate` option generates a list of packages and their respective metadata, such as dependencies and descriptions, that would be obtained by running `apt-get install <package>`. This output can be saved to a file or used in scripts for further processing.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `apt-cache` is a command-line utility that comes with the Advanced Package Tool (APT) in Debian and Ubuntu based systems. It's used for interacting with the local package index.

            The command `apt-cache --help` displays detailed help information about all available subcommands and options for apt-cache. This is particularly useful when you want to remember or learn how to use certain features of apt-cache effectively. The help text covers topics like:

            1. Listing available cached packages (`apt-cache pkgnames [pattern]`)
            2. Displaying detailed information about a package and its dependencies (`apt-cache show <package>`)
            3. Searching for packages based on their names or descriptions (`apt-cache search <searchterm>`)
            4. Listing the packages that depend on, or are depended by, a given package (`apt-cache depends <package>`, `apt-cache reverse-depends <package>`)
            5. Getting information about obsolete packages (`apt-cache obsolete [package]`)
            6. Displaying available virtual packages (`apt-cache policy --virtual`)
            7. Updating the local package index (`apt-cache update`)
            8. and more!

            Overall, `apt-cache --help` is a quick and convenient way to get familiar with the functionality of apt-cache and effectively utilize it for managing your Debian/Ubuntu system's software packages.
        implicit: '[AI] `apt-cache` is a command-line tool in Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions for querying the package indexes. The option `--implicit` is used with the `apt-cache search` command to display packages that depend on the specified package but do not have that package as a dependency themselves. This can be helpful when trying to find packages related to a given package or component.'
        important: '[AI] `apt-cache --import` is a command used with APT (Advanced Package Tool), which is a package manager for Debian and Ubuntu based systems. This command imports a Packages file into the local APT database, allowing you to access and install packages that aren''t available in your current repositories but have been signed by the same keys as those in your existing trusted keys. The `--important` flag is optional; it only affects how the imported packages are labeled within the APT database. Packages labeled as important will be given a higher priority during system upgrades, indicating they contain essential components for the proper functioning of the system.'
        installed: '[AI] `apt-cache --installed` is a command used with APT (Advanced Package Tool), which is a package manager for Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions. This command generates a list of packages currently installed on the system, along with their versions and installation paths, by querying the local package cache. It helps in identifying the specific packages that are presently installed without having to rely on the output from `dpkg --list` or checking each file manually.'
        names-only,: '[AI] `apt-cache --names-only` is a command used in Debian-based Linux distributions to query the package cache for a list of available package names without downloading or installing them. The `--names-only` option specifies that only the package names should be displayed and not any other information such as versions or descriptions. This can be useful for quickly checking which packages are available to be installed without having to manually search through package lists or online repositories.'
        no-breaks: '[AI] `apt-cache --no-breaks` is a command used with APT (Advanced Package Tool), which is a popular package manager for Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions. This command retrieves information about packages from the local package index, but it does so without considering dependencies that would cause a break in the current system. In other words, `apt-cache --no-breaks` allows you to search for packages without installing or upgrading them if they have unmet dependencies, ensuring the stability of your system.'
        no-conflicts: '[AI] `apt-cache --no-conflicts` is a command used with the Advanced Package Tool (apt) in Debian-based Linux distributions. It retrieves a list of available packages and their dependencies, but with the added flag `--no-conflicts`, it will exclude any packages that have conflicts with packages already installed on the system. Conflicts occur when two or more packages require the same file to be modified incompatible ways. This command is useful for avoiding potential package installation issues due to conflicts and for planning package upgrades or installations carefully.'
        no-depends: '[AI] `apt-cache --no-depends` is a command used in Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions to search for packages in the local package cache without retrieving their dependencies. This means that only the specified package and its basic information will be displayed, excluding any dependent packages that would normally be shown when using other `apt-cache` commands. It can help reduce the amount of data transferred and processing time, especially when dealing with large systems or multiple packages at once.'
        no-enhances: '[AI] `apt-cache --no-enhances` is a command used with APT (Advanced Package Tool), which is a package management system for Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions. This command is used to search or retrieve metadata about packages in the local repository without applying any enhancements. Enhancements are optional repositories that provide additional packages or updates to those in the main repository, and they can be enabled or disabled. By using `--no-enhances`, you''re instructing apt-cache to only consider the packages available in the main repository and not include any from enhancements.'
        no-pre-depends: |-
            [AI] `apt-cache --no-pre-depends` is a command used with APT (Advanced Package Tool), which is a package manager for Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions.

            The `apt-cache` part of the command refers to the cache functionality, allowing users to search and retrieve metadata about packages without actually installing them. The option `--no-pre-depends` instructs APT not to include pre-dependencies while showing the dependency tree of a specific package. Pre-dependencies are packages that must be installed before a particular package can be installed, but they do not have a direct requirement on the target package. By omitting them, the output focuses only on essential dependencies.
        no-recommends: '[AI] `apt-cache --no-recommends` is a command used in Debian-based Linux distributions to query the package index without retrieving recommended packages. The `--no-recommends` option instructs the Advanced Package Tool (apt) cache to exclude recommended packages from the search results, allowing users to focus on specific packages and their dependencies.'
        no-replaces: '[AI] `apt-cache` is a command-line tool in Apt package manager for Debian and Ubuntu systems. The `--no-replaces` option when used with `apt-cache search` or `apt-cache show` commands, prevents the display of packages that are automatically replaced by other packages with the same name but different versions. This can be useful if you want to focus on a specific package without being distracted by its replacements.'
        no-suggests: '[AI] `apt-cache --no-suggests` is a command used with Apt, a package manager in Debian and Ubuntu based systems. The option `--no-suggests` asks apt-cache not to show suggested packages during the search result. It only returns the exact match or near-match packages for the given search query without any additional suggestions. This can help in filtering out unnecessary packages from the search results and making the search more focused.'
        option: '[AI] `apt-cache` is a command-line tool in Debian and Ubuntu packages management systems (APT). The option `--option <key> <value>` is used to override certain configuration settings for this specific command invocation. For instance, `apt-cache search --option Diversity true <package-name>` will enable the "Show packages that are similar but not exactly matching" option while performing a package search.'
        pkg-cache: '[AI] `apt-cache` is a command-line tool in Debian and Ubuntu''s Advanced Package Tool (APT) package manager. The `--pkg-cache` option is used to inspect the local package cache. The cache stores downloaded packages and their dependencies for efficient package installation. By using `apt-cache --pkg-cache`, you can query information about the packages in the local cache, such as their versions, sizes, and dependency trees. This can be useful for troubleshooting package management issues or for preparing offline installations.'
        quiet: '[AI] `apt-cache --quiet` is a command used in Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions to query the local package cache for available packages without displaying any verbose output or messages. The "--quiet" option suppresses all non-error messages, making it suitable for use in scripts or automated tasks where only the presence or absence of matching packages is required.'
        recurse: '[AI] `apt-cache` is a command-line tool that is part of the APT (Advanced Package Tool) software handling system used by Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions. The `--recurse` option, when used with `apt-cache`, instructs it to perform a recursive search through the package indexes for dependencies of a given package or for packages that match a specified regular expression. It returns a list of packages along with their respective versions and architectures that meet the search criteria. This information can be useful for analyzing dependencies, planning upgrades or installations, and troubleshooting package management issues.'
        src-cache: '[AI] `apt-cache` is a command-line tool in Debian and Ubuntu package management systems (Apt) for querying its local data files. The option `--src-cache` tells apt-cache to look in the source package archive cache instead of the regular package cache when searching for packages or their information. This can be useful when working with multiple sources or building packages from source.'
        version: '[AI] `apt-cache --version` is a command used in Debian-based Linux distributions to display the version information of the APT (Advanced Package Tool) cache tool. APT is a package management system that allows users to install, remove, and manage software packages in Debian and its derivatives. The `apt-cache` subcommand provides additional functionality like searching for packages and showing their available versions. Running `apt-cache --version` shows only the version number of this particular cache utility, helping users keep track of which APT tool version they are using.'
        with-source: '[AI] `apt-cache --with-source` is a command used with apt-get, a package management tool in Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions. This option retrieves not only the metadata of the available packages from the repositories but also their source code packages. The output includes information about the source packages, such as their location, size, and checksums. This command can be useful for developers who need to build packages from source or for system administrators who want to inspect the source code before installing a package.'
