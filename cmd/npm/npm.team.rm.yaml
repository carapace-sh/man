description: remove a user from a team they belong to
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm team rm` command is used to remove a member from an npm team in a scoped package registry, such as npmjs.com or GitHub Packages. It requires the user to have appropriate permissions (like owner or admin) on the team and the package project. The syntax is typically `npm team rm MEMBER_USERNAME --scope=SCOPE`, where MEMBER_USERNAME is the username of the member to be removed, and SCOPE is the scope of the package if it''s a scoped package (e.g., @myorg). This command updates the team information in the package.json file and also removes the member from the team on the registry.'
