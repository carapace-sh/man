        [AI] `gh cache` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to interact with GitHub's local cache feature. This command allows you to retrieve, store, or update files and data from GitHub's caching system without having to re-download them over the network.

        Using this command, you can:

        1. Fetch cached contents of a specific file or repository by using `gh cache get <key>`.
        2. Store local files or directories in the cache with `gh cache add <file/directory>`, which generates a key for the added content.
        3. Update the cached content by using `gh cache put <key> <new_content>` to replace existing cached data.
        4. Remove cached contents using `gh cache rm <key>`.
        5. List all cached items with `gh cache list`.

        This command can help improve your workflow by reducing network traffic and download times for frequently accessed files or dependencies.
