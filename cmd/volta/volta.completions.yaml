        force: '[AI] `volta completions --force` is a command used in Volta, a modern toolkit for managing JavaScript projects. This command is used to update or install completion scripts for your favorite terminal autocomplete system (like Tabzimzee, Fish, or Bash), forcing an update even if the local installation is already up-to-date. It ensures that you always have the most recent completions for Volta-managed projects in your terminal autocomplete suggestions.'
        help: '[AI] `volta completions --help` is a command used in Volta, a modern toolkit for managing and deploying applications. This specific command displays help information about Volta''s autocompletion feature. It provides details on how to install, enable, and use Volta''s autocompletion for various shell types (like bash or zsh) to get suggestions as you type commands related to Volta-managed tools in your terminal.'
        output: '[AI] The `--output` flag in Volta, a command-line interface for managing tools and workflows for JavaScript projects, specifies where to output the result of a given Volta command. By default, Volta outputs messages to the console. However, with `--output` flag, users can redirect the output to a file or a specific location such as stdout or stderr. For instance, `volta completions --output json file.json` will produce the completion suggestions in JSON format and save it to the specified file.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `volta completions --quiet` command is used with Volta, a modular package manager for JavaScript projects. This command generates and installs completions (autocompletion suggestions) for your terminal or shell in a quiet mode, which means that it will run without displaying any informational messages during the process.'
        verbose: '[AI] `volta completions --verbose` is a command used in Volta, a modular and universal tool manager for JavaScript projects. This command generates autocompletion suggestions for various shells (like bash or zsh) with Volta-managed packages. The `--verbose` flag increases the output level of information provided during the generation process, allowing users to better understand what is being generated and any potential issues that may arise.'
