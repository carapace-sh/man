documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nfpm completion zsh` command is used to install Zsh completions for Node.js package manager `nfpm`. This allows for tab-completion of packages and commands when using `nfpm` in the Zsh shell. It''s usually installed as a part of the `node-zsh-developer-tools` package or by manually downloading the completion file from npm and adding it to your Zsh configuration.'
    flag:
        no-descriptions: |-
            [AI] The command `nfpm completion zsh --no-descriptions` is related to the Node.js package manager, npm, and the shell `zsh`.

            The `nfpm` part indicates that this is a custom script for interacting with npm, possibly created by the user for convenience or personal preference. The rest of the command is about setting up tab completion for zsh using npm's package information.

            `completion` is the action, meaning it configures tab completion. `zsh` specifies that this setup is for the Zsh shell. `--no-descriptions` is an option which instructs the command not to display package names as descriptions when you press the 'Tab' key while typing them in the terminal. This can make your terminal session run faster by reducing the time it takes to display the description each time.
