    command: |-
        [AI] The `brew extract` command is not a built-in Homebrew (macOS package manager) command. There seems to be some confusion as it's not part of Homebrew's core functionality.

        However, there exists a third-party tool called `brew-extract` which can be used to extract the source code of Homebrew installations. This tool requires `brew` and `git` to be installed in your system. To use it, run `brew extract [formula_name]` where `[formula_name]` is the name of the specific Homebrew installation you wish to extract. The command will clone the corresponding GitHub repository associated with the formula into a local directory.
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `brew extract --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command is used to extract the source code of a Homebrew formula or cask with debug information. The debug information includes additional data that can be useful for troubleshooting and understanding how the formula or cask functions. The extracted code can then be studied locally for further analysis or modification.'
        force: '[AI] `brew extract --force` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to force extract files from a previously downloaded Homebrew bottle instead of redownloading it. The `--force` option overrides the default behavior and extracts the contents even if the checksum or file size does not match the expected values. It''s useful when dealing with corrupted or incomplete downloads, allowing users to resume the installation process from where it left off.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `brew extract` is a command-line tool provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--help` option is used to display detailed information about how to use this command. When you run `brew extract --help`, the terminal will show a help message that includes:

            1. A brief description of what `brew extract` does: extracts a bottle (Homebrew's term for a package) from a Homebrew Cellar (Homebrew's repository), usually creating a symlink to it in /usr/local.
            2. Usage examples and syntax:
               ```
               brew extract [--force] [--verbose] formula-name
               ```
            3. A list of options:
               - `--force`: Overwrites an existing symlink without asking for confirmation.
               - `--verbose`: Displays detailed information about the extraction process.
            4. Examples with explanations:
               ```
               # Extract 'python@3.9' and create a new symlink named 'python3.9'.
               brew extract python@3.9 python3.9

               # Extract 'python@3.9', overwriting the existing symlink without confirmation, and display verbose output.
               brew extract --force --verbose python@3.9
               ```
        quiet: '[AI] The `brew extract --quiet` command is a function in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, used to extract the contents of an installed Homebrew formula into a separate directory. The `--quiet` flag is optional and, when used, suppresses informational output during the extraction process, making the terminal window display only error messages if any occur.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew extract` is a command-line tool from Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output during the extraction process. It displays detailed information about each step in the process, including the files being extracted and any messages or warnings that may occur. This can be helpful for troubleshooting issues or understanding the specifics of the extraction operation.'
        version: '[AI] `brew extract --version` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is utilized to retrieve the version number of a specific Homebrew installation or formula. The output will display the exact version of the software that is currently installed, providing users with essential information about their setup.'
