documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "downgrade" command refers to the action of reducing the version or level of something, often used in the context of software to revert from a newer version to an older one due to compatibility issues or other reasons. This can be achieved by uninstalling the latest version and installing an earlier one manually or using specific tools designed for this purpose.'
    flag:
        ala-only: '[AI] The `downgrade --ала-only` command is used in Subversion (SVN), a popular version control system, to downgrade a specific revision of a working copy to an older revision while keeping all local changes and keeping the working copy in a detached state. This means that the working copy will no longer track any further changes in the repository. It''s important to note that using this command can lead to data loss or inconsistencies if used improperly.'
        ala-url: '[AI] The `downgrade --alpine-url` command is used in Docker to downgrade an Alpine-based Docker image to a specific version specified by the `--alpine-url` argument. This command pulls the new image, checks its digital signature for security, and then forcefully replaces the current image with it. The downgraded image will have the same name as the original image but with a different tag representing the new version. It is important to note that using an outdated image can expose vulnerabilities and potential security risks, so it''s crucial to understand the implications and ensure the downgraded image is safe for use.'
        cached-only: '[AI] The `--cached-only` option when using the `downgrade` command in Docker refers to downgrading an image or container while keeping only the cached data and not affecting the running instance. This means that any changes made to the running container will not be affected, and the new image will only overwrite the cached data. It is useful for updating an image without disrupting the current state of a container.'
        help: '[AI] The `downgrade` is a command-line tool used in various packages, including Python''s pip, to roll back the installed version of a package to a previous one. The `--help` option, when used with `downgrade`, displays detailed help information about how to use the command. It explains that you can specify the target package and its desired version using arguments or by providing a requirements file, and it shows possible options like `--quiet`, `--no-deps`, and others, which can influence the downgrading process. For instance, `downgrade package_name 1.0 --help` will provide information on how to downgrade ''package\_name'' to version 1.0 with additional help details.'
        maxdepth: '[AI] The `--maxdepth` option in the `downgrade` command in Git is used to specify the maximum number of parent commits that should be kept when downgrading the version of a dependency. By default, `downgrade` keeps all ancestor commits, but this option allows limiting the depth to a certain level. For example, `downgrade --maxdepth 2` would only keep the two most recent parent commits of the dependency. This can be useful when you want to downgrade to an older version but don''t need all the historical commits between that version and the current one.'
        pacman: |-
            [AI] The `downgrade` command in Pacman, a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives, is used to reinstall a previously installed package at a specific version. The `--pacman` option is not a separate flag but specifies that the downgrade command should be run using the Pacman system itself, rather than an external tool like `bsdfw`.

            So, when you use the command `downgrade --pacman <package> <version>`, it tells Pacman to downgrade the specified package to the given version. This can be useful if you encountered a problem after updating a package and want to revert to a previous working state.
        pacman-cache: '[AI] The `downgrade --pacman-cache` command is used in Arch Linux and its derivatives to force the Pacman package manager to use an older version of a cached package instead of the latest one. This can be useful when encountering compatibility issues or wanting to revert to a previously working setup. By downgrading, you are essentially replacing the currently installed package with an older version from your local cache or the Arch Linux repository. However, note that using this command may introduce security vulnerabilities or other issues if the downgraded package contains known fixes for security flaws or other important improvements. Always carefully consider the potential risks before running such a command.'
        pacman-conf: '[AI] The `downgrade` command in Arch Linux is used to roll back the version of a specific package to an earlier one. The option `--pacman-conf` is used to modify Pacman''s configuration file during the downgrade process, instead of using the global settings. This can be useful when you need to downgrade a package while maintaining certain Pacman configurations that might affect the downgrade operation. It''s essential to know what those configurations are and how they influence the downgrade, as making incorrect changes could lead to unwanted side effects or issues in your system.'
        pacman-log: '[AI] The command `downgrade --pacman-log` is a command used in Arch Linux and its derivatives to downgrade specific packages and their dependencies to previously installed versions while keeping Pacman''s log file. This command helps maintain a clean record of the package version history when performing system updates or rollbacks. It does not modify the log file but rather keeps it intact during the downgrade process.'
        version: '[AI] The `downgrade` command with the `--version` option is used to intentionally reduce the installed version of a Python package to an earlier one. This can be helpful when encountering compatibility issues between packages or when needing to use a specific version for testing or development purposes. By specifying the desired version number, this command modifies the virtual environment or project''s `requirements.txt` file accordingly and installs the downgraded package version.'
