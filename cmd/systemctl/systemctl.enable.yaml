    command: '[AI] `systemctl enable` is a command used in Linux systems to create or modify systemd unit files, enabling them to automatically start during boot or on various other events. This command essentially sets the desired target state of a service or a systemd unit to "enabled" and creates or updates the corresponding symlink under `/etc/systemd/system` or `/etc/init.d`, allowing the specified unit to be started at system startup or when certain conditions are met.'
