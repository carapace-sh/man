    command: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud box` command is used to search for and download Vagrant boxes (pre-configured virtual machines) from the Vagrant Cloud repository. The syntax is typically in the following format: `vagrant box list <box_name> | vagrant box download`. For instance, `vagrant box list precise64 | vagrant box download precise64` will search for a 64-bit Precise version box and then download it. The boxes are available in various configurations based on different operating systems and versions.'
