documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker container logs` is a command used to view the output of the most recent logs from a specified Docker container. It can be executed by providing the container ID or name as an argument. The command displays the log data in real time, with the latest entries appearing first. Options like `--since`, `--until`, and `--tail` can be used to filter the logs based on timestamps or number of lines.'
    flag:
        details: '[AI] `docker container logs --details` is a command used in Docker to view the detailed logs of a specific container. The `--details` option increases the amount of output displayed, including timestamps, container ID, and process IDs associated with each log entry. This can be helpful for debugging issues within the container or for understanding the flow of events as they occur in real time.'
        follow: '[AI] `docker container logs --follow` is a command used in Docker to view real-time logs from a specified container. The `--follow` or `-f` flag enables following log output in real time, meaning the latest logs are displayed as they''re written, rather than only displaying logs that have already been saved. This allows users to monitor a container''s activity continuously.'
        since: '[AI] `docker container logs` is a command used to view the logs of a running Docker container. The `--since` option filters the output to show only the logs generated after a specific time. For example, `docker container logs <container_name> --since=1h` will display the logs generated in the last 1 hour. This can be useful for troubleshooting or monitoring container activity.'
        tail: '[AI] `docker container logs --tail` is a command used in Docker to view the most recent output from the specified container''s standard output stream (stdout). The `--tail` option followed by a number specifies the number of most recent log lines to display. For example, `docker container logs --tail 10 my_container` would show the last 10 lines of output for the container named "my\_container".'
        timestamps: '[AI] `docker container logs --timestamps` is a command used to view the logs of a running Docker container. The `--timestamps` option adds timestamps to each log line for easier identification and tracking of when each message was produced. This can be helpful when working with large or complex logs and wanting to quickly locate specific messages based on their timestamp.'
        until: '[AI] `docker container logs` is a command used to view the logs of a running Docker container. The `--until` option specifies a time limit for the output, showing only the logs that were generated since the specified time. For example, `docker container logs <container_name> --until=1h` would display the logs generated in the last hour. This can be useful for quickly reviewing recent log activity or troubleshooting issues in a container.'
