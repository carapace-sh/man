    command: '[AI] The `avdmanager list avd` command is used with the Android Studio''s AVD Manager tool to display a list of installed Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) on your system. It allows you to see the names, API levels, and other relevant details of each AVD that has been configured for use in your development environment.'
    flag:
        compact: '[AI] `avdmanager list avd --compact` is a command used in Android Studio or command line tools like SDK Manager to display a compact list of installed Android Virtual Devices (AVDs). The `--compact` option makes the output more succinct by showing only the names and IDs of the AVDs, without additional details such as configuration overrides. This can be useful for quickly checking which AVDs are currently available in your environment.'
        "null": '[AI] The command `avdmanager list avd --null` is used with the Android Virtual Device Manager (AVD) in the Android Studio environment. This command specifically requests a list of available AVDs, but with an added option to return an empty list if no AVDs are found. The `--null` flag instructs the command to output an empty line for each missing or nonexistent AVD. In essence, it returns a blank list when no AVDs are present.'
