    -u, --user=: The account to log out of
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `gh auth token` command is used to generate a new GitHub authentication token in the Git Bash or Git for Windows terminal environment. This command interacts with GitHub''s web interface through the `gh` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. Once executed, it opens your web browser and guides you through the process of logging into your GitHub account and authorizing the creation of a new token. The generated token is then printed to the terminal for easy copying and usage in Git commands.'
    flag:
        hostname: '[AI] The `gh auth token --hostname` command is used in GitHub''s `git-credentials-helper` and `gh-auth` tools to generate or manage personal access tokens (PATs) for authentication with GitHub. This specific command generates a new token or shows the currently set token, along with its expiration date, associated hostname(s), and scopes. The hostname argument specifies which GitHub instance or organization''s token will be displayed or created. For example, to generate or update a token for a specific GitHub hostname like ''github.com'', you would use the command `gh auth token --hostname github.com`. This helps ensure that the correct tokens are used for authentication with the appropriate GitHub instances.'
        secure-storage: '[AI] `gh auth token --secure-storage` is a command used in GitHub''s Git CLI (git-hub.exe) to create, manage, and revoke personal access tokens (PATs) with enhanced security by storing them in the Windows Secrets Manager or Keychain on macOS instead of exposing them as plain text in environment variables or config files. This adds an extra layer of protection for sensitive information.'
        user: '[AI] The `gh auth token --user` command is used with GitHub''s git-credentials helper to create or manage a new authentication token for Git over the command line. The `--user` option specifies the name of the user account associated with the token. The command generates or updates an existing token and saves it in your Git credential helper store for secure use in authenticating with GitHub during git operations.'
