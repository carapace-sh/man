    command: '[AI] `tmux list-sessions` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to display a list of current sessions. When run, it prints out session names and their associated statuses (e.g., "attached", "detached") allowing users to easily identify and manage their active sessions.'
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `tmux list-sessions` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to display a list of currently available sessions. The `-F` option modifies the output format of the command. Specifically, it allows users to customize the output by specifying one or more strings to be displayed for each session. For example, `tmux list-sessions -F "#S: #I"`, would display the session name (#S) and the session ID (#I). In the case of `tmux list-sessions -F`, no additional format string is provided, so it defaults to showing only the session names.'
        f: '[AI] `tmux list-sessions` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer utility, used to display a list of current sessions. The `-f` (or --full-name) option is used with this command to display the full session names instead of the default abbreviated format. So, `tmux list-sessions -f` will show the complete names of all active TMUX sessions.'
