documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `git instaweb` command is not a standard Git command. It seems to be specific to certain Git workflows or tools, possibly related to integrating web content into Git repositories using Instant Web Share or similar tools. The exact functionality and usage would depend on the specific implementation of this command in those workflows or tools. For general Git usage, there is no such command as `git instaweb`.'
    flag:
        browser: '[AI] `git instaweb` is a Git extension that allows you to fetch and push web content, such as HTML files or entire websites, along with your code using Git. The `--browser` option opens the fetched web content in your default web browser after the fetch or pull operation is completed. This can be useful for collaborative web development projects where both code and content need to be synchronized.'
        httpd: '[AI] The `git instaweb` command is a Git extension for serving web content from a local repository using an embedded lightweight HTTP server. The `--httpd` option starts the HTTP server, making it accessible at a specified port number or by linking it to another web service. This command allows easy sharing and collaboration on static website projects directly from a Git repository.'
        local: '[AI] `git instaweb` is a Git extension that allows pushing and pulling web files to and from a repository using Git commands. The `--local` option specifies that the operation should be performed on the local files, without affecting the remote repository. This can be useful for testing or synchronizing local web files with a Git workflow. When used with `git pull`, it fetches the latest web files from the remote repository but keeps your local changes; when used with `git push`, it pushes only the local web files to the remote repository while keeping remote changes.'
        port: '[AI] The `git instaweb` command is not a standard Git command, but rather a custom script or tool used for pushing or fetching content from a Git repository hosted on the Instant Web Hosting Platform (instaweb.io). The `--port` option specifies which port number to use for connecting to Instant Web Hosting''s Git server. By default, it may use port 22, but if there''s a need to connect using an alternative port, that can be specified with this option. For instance, `git instaweb --port 2222` would connect to the Git server on Instant Web Hosting using port 2222.'
        restart: '[AI] The `git instaweb` command is not a standard Git command, but rather a custom Git extension or alias used for interacting with web repositories hosted on GitHub or similar platforms. The `--restart` option is passed to this command to fetch and reload the latest changes made to the remote repository, discarding any local changes that might conflict. It effectively resets your local repository to match the current state of the remote, encouraging a smooth workflow for collaborative development.'
        start: '[AI] `git instaweb` is a Git extension for working with web repositories hosted on Instagram, such as those used for static websites or Jupyter Notebooks. The `--start` option initiates a new synchronization between the local Git repository and the remote web repository. When you run `git instaweb --start`, it fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local branch if necessary, applying any local changes as well. This command sets up the connection between the Git repository and Instagram web service for further interactions like pushing or pulling changes.'
        stop: '[AI] `git instaweb` is a Git extension for syncing Git repositories with remote web files. The command `git instaweb --stop` is used to pause or stop the ongoing synchronization process between a local Git repository and its corresponding web files. This can be useful when you want to temporarily halt the syncing process due to network issues, or if you need to manually modify some files before continuing with the sync.'
