    --user=: the username for new keys
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `restic key` command in Restic, a backup program, is used to manage encryption keys. It allows users to create, list, import, or delete encryption keys. Encryption keys ensure data security by encrypting backups before they are stored offsite or in the cloud. Using the `restic key` command helps ensure that only authorized individuals can access the backed-up data.'
    flag:
        host: '[AI] The `restic key --host` command is used in the data backup and sync tool, restic. This command generates a new encryption key and stores it on the specified host. The `--host` option indicates the remote server or host where the key will be stored. By default, restic uses local files for keys, but this option allows you to store keys remotely over SSH, for example. This is useful in setting up a distributed backup system with multiple hosts.'
        new-password-file: '[AI] The `--new-password-file` flag in `restic`, a backup program, is used to provide a file containing the new password for creating or updating an encrypted backup repository. This flag helps maintain security by avoiding transmitting the password over the network during the backup process. Instead, the password file is read locally on the client machine before creating the encrypted backup.'
        user: '[AI] `restic key --user` is a command used in Restic, a backup program that provides an efficient incremental data transfer and storage. This specific command is for setting or displaying the encryption key user passphrase. The `--user` flag indicates that the key being set or displayed is associated with the user account instead of the system account. The passphrase protects the data encryption key, ensuring that only authorized users can access the encrypted backups.'
