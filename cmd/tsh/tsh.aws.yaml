documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "tsh aws" is not a standard Linux or Unix command, but rather a potential alias or shortcut in a specific configuration, possibly for using the Telescope SHell (TSH) to interact with Amazon Web Services (AWS) through AWS CLI commands. It may be set up by users or system administrators to provide easier access to commonly used AWS commands within the TSH environment. For more information on its usage and available functionalities, it is recommended to consult the documentation of the specific TSH implementation being utilized.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `tsh aws --app` command is a part of the TSH (Telstra Shell) CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for managing AWS (Amazon Web Services) resources. The specific `--app` flag is used to identify the name or alias of an application in AWS. This command helps users interact with various AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk, CodePipeline, and AppRunner by allowing them to specify the application name during execution of TSH commands for easier management and deployment of applications within their AWS environment.'
        endpoint-url: '[AI] The `tsh aws --endpoint-url` command is used with the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains (TSH), which is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA and other JetBrains IDEs to interact with Amazon Web Services (AWS). This command specifically sets or retrieves the endpoint URL for an AWS connection. The endpoint URL specifies the location of the AWS region where the API calls will be made, such as `us-west-2.amazonaws.com` for the US West (Oregon) region. Setting this URL allows TSH to authenticate and send requests to the correct AWS region.'
        exec: '[AI] `tsh aws --exec` is a command used in the TSH (Terraform State House) CLI tool for managing AWS resources using Terraform. The `--exec` option instructs TSH to execute an inline Terraform configuration script, allowing users to apply Terraform actions without creating or modifying a Terraform configuration file. This command is useful when you want to perform ad-hoc actions on AWS infrastructure managed by Terraform without altering the main configuration files.'
        no-endpoint-url: '[AI] The `--no-endpoint-url` flag is used with the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) `tsh` (Telnet SSH) command for connecting to an Amazon Elastic Beanstalk environment or EC2 instance in a private registry. This flag tells the CLI not to include the endpoint URL while generating the SSH config file, allowing you to manually specify your own URL when using the generated SSH key. In essence, it allows for more customized control over the connection setup.'
