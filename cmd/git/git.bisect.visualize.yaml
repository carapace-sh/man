documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git bisect visualize` is a Git command used to display a graphical representation of the commit history involved in a bisect operation. Bisect is a Git feature for finding the commit that introduced a bug. This command generates an interactive TUI or web interface using tools like `gitk`, `git gui`, or `gitk --web`, allowing users to visually inspect and interact with the commits during the bisect process, making it easier to identify the problematic commit.'
    flag:
        p: '[AI] `git bisect visualize --p` is a Git command used to display a graphical representation of the commit history during a git bisect operation. The `--p` option stands for "patch", which means it shows the difference between the good and bad commits in the graph. This can help identify the specific commit that introduced a regression or bug, making it easier to fix the issue.'
        stat: '[AI] `git bisect visualize --stat` is a Git command used to display a graphical representation of the commit history during a git bisect operation. The `--stat` option adds an additional column in the output showing the file modifications between each commit, making it easier to identify the commit causing the issue or regression. The resulting visualization helps developers find the commit responsible for introducing a bug by narrowing down the range of commits that need further investigation.'
