documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command `toit lsp toitdoc` is used in Toit programming language environment. It invokes the Language Server Protocol (LSP) for Toit, which enables advanced editing features like autocompletion, code navigation, and error checking in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The `toitdoc` part of the command likely refers to generating or updating documentation using Toit''s built-in documentation tool.'
    flag:
        exclude-sdk: '[AI] The `toit` command with the given flag `--exclude-sdk` is used in the Toit programming language for building projects without including the SDK (Standard Development Kit) during the build process. This means that only the project code will be compiled, and not any SDK libraries or headers. It''s helpful when trying to minimize the built binary size or when working with external dependencies.'
        include-private: '[AI] `toit lsp` is a Text Editor plugin for the Toit programming language, providing features like autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and error reporting. `toitdoc` is a tool that generates documentation for Toit code. The command `toit lsp toitdoc --include-private` asks for both the Language Server Process (LSP) functionality and document generation with the option `--include-private`. This flag tells `toitdoc` to include private members in the generated documentation, making all documentation visible to users even if they are not part of the public API.'
        out: |-
            [AI] The command `toit lsp toitdoc --out` is used in Toit programming language for generating documentation from source code using the Toit Language Server Process (LSP) and Toit Documentator tool.

            The `toit` keyword refers to the Toit executable or runtime environment. `lsp` is a subcommand that starts the Toit Language Server, which provides features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and code validation for Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

            `toitdoc` is the name of the tool used to generate documentation from comments in the source code. The `--out` flag specifies the output directory where the generated HTML files will be saved.
        parallel: '[AI] `toit lsp toitdoc --parallel` is a command using Toit programming language''s tools for Live Server Previewing (LSP) and documentation generation (toitdoc). The `--parallel` flag enables parallel processing, meaning multiple tasks are executed concurrently to improve build time efficiency. This command sets up the development environment to display real-time code edits in an external editor and generates updated documentation simultaneously.'
        root-path: |-
            [AI] The command `toit lsp toitdoc --root-path` is used in Toit programming language for starting the Toit Language Server Process (LSP) and generating documentation with ToitDoc.

            The `toit` keyword is a reference to the Toit executable or interpreter. `lsp` stands for Language Server Process, which provides intelligent editing features like autocompletion, code formatting, and error checking for IDEs and text editors. The flag `--root-path` specifies the root directory of the project being worked on, providing context for the LSP and documentation generation process.
        sdk: |-
            [AI] The command `toit lsp toitdoc --sdk` is used in the Toit programming language for setting up integrated development environment (IDE) features. Here's a brief explanation of each part:

            1. `toit`: This is the name of the Toit command-line interface or compiler.
            2. `lsp`: LSP stands for Language Server Protocol, which enables advanced IDE features like code completion, error checking, and hover information.
            3. `toitdoc`: This is the Toit documentation generator tool that creates API documentation from annotated source files.
            4. `--sdk`: The `--sdk` option specifies the installation directory of the Toit Software Development Kit (SDK). It includes the compiler, standard library, and other development tools.
        toitc: |-
            [AI] The command `toit lsp toitdoc --toitc` is used in Toit programming language for building and documenting source code.

            - `toit`: This is the name of the Toit compiler or build tool that executes the command.
            - `lsp`: It stands for Language Server Protocol, which enables editor integration for features like autocompletion, error checking, and code navigation.
            - `toitdoc`: It is a documentation generator for the Toit language, used to create and update the API documentation.
            - `--toitc`: This option is passed to the compiler or build tool, instructing it to generate compiled Toit code (`.toitc`) files instead of running the built targets by default.
        verbose: |-
            [AI] `toit lsp toitdoc --verbose` is a command used in the Toit programming language's development environment. The command consists of three parts:

            1. `toit`: This is the name of the Toit compiler and toolchain, which provides various utilities for building, testing, and documenting Toit code.
            2. `lsp`: This part specifies that the command invokes the Language Server Protocol (LSP) component of Toit's development tools. LSP enables advanced editing features in IDEs and text editors, such as autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and error checking.
            3. `toitdoc --verbose`: The last part is an optional flag passed to the `toitdoc` utility, which generates documentation for Toit projects using Markdown format. The `--verbose` flag enables detailed output during the documentation generation process.
        version: '[AI] `toit lsp toitdoc --version` is a command used in Toit programming language development environment. It requests the version information for both Toit Language Server (LSP) and ToitDoc documentation generator. The `--version` flag is an option that instructs the command to print out the current versions of these tools.'
