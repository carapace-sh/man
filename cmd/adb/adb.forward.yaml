name: forward
description: forward socket connection
flags:
    --list: list all forward socket connections
    --no-rebind: don't replace existing connection
    --remove: remove specific forward socket connections
    --remove-all: remove all forward socket connections
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `adb forward` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to establish a TCP connection between the host and the device, allowing data to be tunneled through it. This command forwards a specific port from the device to the host machine. Once established, applications on the host can connect to that port to access services or data on the device. It''s commonly used for debugging and testing networked applications.'
    flag:
        list: '[AI] `adb forward` is a command-line tool in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) that allows establishing ports for forwarding traffic between a local and remote system. The `--list` option is used to display the current list of active forwarded ports. Essentially, `adb forward --list` shows all the existing port mappings established between your local and device or emulator.'
        no-rebind: '[AI] `adb forward` is a command in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) used to establish a TCP connection between the device and the host computer. The `--no-rebind` option prevents ADB from automatically assigning a local port number for the forwarded connection, instead requiring the user to specify their own port number. This can be useful when setting up custom applications or services that require specific port numbers for communication between the device and the host computer.'
        remove: '[AI] `adb forward --remove` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB), a versatile tool for communicating with an Android device for debugging and managing it from a command-line interface. This command removes a previously established forwarded local port to local device port binding. By using this command, the connection between the device and the local port on your development machine is terminated. It''s helpful when you no longer need the forwarding or want to use another port for the same purpose.'
        remove-all: '[AI] `adb forward --remove-all` is a command used with Android Debug Bridge (ADB), which allows establishing a communication link between an Android device and a computer. This specific command removes all previously set up port forwardings, effectively cutting off any established remote connections to the device. It''s useful when you want to terminate ongoing ADB sessions or reset network forwarding settings for security or troubleshooting purposes.'
