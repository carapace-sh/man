documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `minikube addons images` command is used to pull and manage additional Kubernetes add-on images in Minikube, a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. By default, Minikube comes with some commonly used add-ons like Docker, Fluentd, and Prometheus, but you can install more by specifying their names as arguments to this command. For example, `minikube addons images enable dashboard` will download the latest image for the Kubernetes Dashboard addon. The `images` subcommand checks for updates and manages the availability of these add-on images in your local Minikube environment.'
