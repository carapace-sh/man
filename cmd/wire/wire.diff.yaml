documentation:
    command: '[AI] `wire diff` is a command in the Open Source System-on-Chip (SoC) design automation tool, called "Wire," developed by Google. This command compares two versions of a Wire definition file and generates a patch file showing the differences between them. The patch file can then be applied to update one definition file to match the other, helping in version control and collaboration for complex SoC designs.'
    flag:
        header_file: '[AI] The `wire diff` command is a tool used in Git and other version control systems to generate a patch file, showing the differences between two commits or two branches. The `-header_file` option tells `wire diff` to include a custom file with a predefined header text at the beginning of each generated patch file. This can be useful for adding a standardized format, such as a company logo or legal disclaimer, to every patch file.'
        tags: '[AI] `wire diff -tags` is a command used in the Wire dependency manager for Haskell. It compares the current project configuration with the last committed version in the Git repository and shows the differences between the two, specifically focusing on changes to tags (dependency versions). This can help identify added, removed, or updated dependencies, as well as version upgrades or downgrades.'
