documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vcs` (version control system) completion script for Zsh is called `zsh-complesions/_vetcs`. The command `vcs completion zsh` refers to installing or enabling this specific Zsh completion script. This script enhances the autocompletion functionality for various version control systems such as Git, Mercurial, and Subversion in the Zsh shell. It suggests possible repository names and branch/tag names when typing in the terminal, making it easier to navigate and use these systems.'
    flag:
        no-descriptions: '[AI] The command `vhs completion zsh --no-descriptions` is a custom Zsh completion configuration for the VHS (Vim-style Helm) plugin. The `--no-descriptions` flag disables the display of descriptions or tooltips while using the completion feature in Zsh. This can help to make the completion experience more streamlined and less cluttered, reducing visual noise and potential distractions. By using this flag, users can quickly cycle through completion suggestions using the arrow keys without interruptions from additional text on the screen.'
