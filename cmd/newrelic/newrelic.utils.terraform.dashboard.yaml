    command: '[AI] The `newrelicutils terraform dashboard` command is a custom Terraform module provided by New Relic to configure and manage New Relic dashboards using Terraform infrastructure as code. This command helps create, update, or delete New Relic dashboards as part of your Terraform configuration, ensuring consistency between your infrastructure and monitoring setup.'
    flag:
        file: '[AI] The `newrelic utils terraform dashboard --file` command is a Terraform utility script provided by New Relic. It generates a Terraform configuration file (in HCL format) for creating and managing New Relic dashboards using the Terraform infrastructure as code tool. By including `--file`, users can specify an output file to save the generated configuration. This enables infrastructure management, versioning, and automated deployment of New Relic dashboards alongside other resources managed by Terraform.'
        label: '[AI] The `newrelic utils terraform dashboard --label` command is a Terraform utility script provided by New Relic, which generates and configures an New Relic dashboard using the Terraform configuration file. The `--label` flag is used to provide labels for the generated resources or dashboards in the New Relic UI. These labels help to easily identify and manage specific resources within the platform.'
        out: '[AI] The `newrelic utils terraform dashboard --out` command is a Terraform utility script provided by New Relic. It generates an Output File for Terraform state in JSON format, which can be used to configure the New Relic Dashboard. The flag `--out` specifies the file name and path where the generated output will be saved. This allows users to easily import and manage their dashboard configuration within their Terraform infrastructure as code.'
        shiftWidth: '[AI] The command `newrelic utils terraform dashboard --shiftWidth` is used to adjust the width of columns in New Relic Terraform-generated dashboards by a specified number of pixels (represented by the `--shiftWidth` flag). This can be helpful for better visualization and comparison of metrics within the dashboard. The `newrelic utils terraform` part refers to the New Relic Utilities command-line tool, which is used in conjunction with Terraform for managing New Relic infrastructure.'
