        [AI] `vercel` is a platform for static sites and serverless functions, and the `deploy` command is used to build and deploy your project on Vercel. Here's a brief explanation of how it works:

        1. First, you need to have your project initialized with Vercel by running `npm init vercel` or `yarn init vercel`. This creates a `vercel.json` file in your project directory, where you can configure build settings and other options.
        2. Once your project is initialized, you can run `vercel` or `vercel --prod` to start the development server and deploy your site or function locally for testing.
        3. To deploy your project to Vercel's production environment, use the command `vercel --prod`. This will trigger a build of your project using the configured build settings, and then deploy the built files to Vercel. The URL of your deployed site or function will be displayed in the terminal output.
        4. If you have multiple projects in different directories, you can specify the directory path as an argument to the `deploy` command, like `vercel my-project/ --prod`.
        5. Vercel also supports continuous deployment from Git repositories, which means that every time you push changes to your repository, Vercel will automatically build and deploy the updated version of your project. To enable this feature, follow the instructions in the Vercel documentation.
