documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "wire wire" is not a valid command in any common programming or scripting language. It seems to be a misspelled or incorrect combination of the word "wire," which could refer to electrical wiring or data transmission, and the verb "wire," which means to provide someone with confidential information. Without more context, it''s impossible to determine what this command is intended to do.'
    flag:
        tags: '[AI] The `--wire --tags` flag is used with Git to push or fetch branch changes while keeping track of wire-linked commits. These commits represent work in progress that''s not yet ready for merging into the main branch but needs to be shared with collaborators. By using this flag, Git will transfer only the tags associated with those wire-linked commits, allowing team members to see and discuss the ongoing changes without pulling or pushing the entire branch.'
