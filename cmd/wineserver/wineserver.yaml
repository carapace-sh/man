documentation:
    command: '[AI] `wineserver` is a background daemon in Wine (an compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux and other systems). It manages the creation and termination of Wine sessions, allowing remote connections via SSH or other means to run Windows applications using X Windows System for graphical output. When started, it listens for incoming connections and handles them as necessary.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] The `wineserver --debug` command is used to start the Wine application server with debugging enabled. Wine is a compatibility layer that allows Windows applications to run on Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The `--debug` flag enables various debugging features, such as printing more detailed information to the console or writing debug output to a file. This can be useful for developers who are trying to diagnose and fix issues with Wine or specific Windows applications running under it.'
        foreground: '[AI] `wineserver --foreground` is a command used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix-based systems. This specific command starts the Wine servers in the foreground instead of as background processes. By doing this, you can monitor the server''s output and have better control over its execution. It''s useful when troubleshooting or during the initial setup and configuration of Wine applications.'
        help: '[AI] `wineserver --help` is a command used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix-like operating systems. This command displays the help information for the `wineserver` utility. The `--help` option requests that `wineserver` prints out detailed usage instructions and options available. It explains how to use `wineserver` to run a Windows application in a new Wine process, and may also list various debugging or troubleshooting flags.'
        kill: '[AI] `wineserver --kill` is a command used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix-like operating systems. This command is used to forcefully stop the Wine server process. The "--kill" option signifies that the process should be terminated without regard for any open connections or resources it may have. It''s typically employed when the server becomes unresponsive or causes issues, requiring an immediate restart.'
        persistent: '[AI] `wineserver --persistent` is a command used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix-based systems. This specific command starts the Wine servers in persistent mode, meaning it keeps running even after launching the Windows application that depends on it. The Wine server provides the necessary Windows environment for the application to run effectively on Linux or macOS. In summary, `wineserver --persistent` ensures a continuous Wine server session for efficiently running Windows applications within the Unix-based system.'
        version: '[AI] `wineserver --version` is a command used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix-like operating systems. This command is used to display the version number of the installed Wine implementation. When executed, it prints out information about the version, including the major and minor release numbers, revision level, and the date of the build. For example, "Wine 5.21 DLLs, x86_64, built on darwin-x86_64-portable, commit hash 9c7a38d Mercurial-361 (2021-12-15)" indicates that the Wine installation is version 5.21 and was built on a Darwin system with an x86_64 architecture. The revision level is 9c7a38d, and the last commit was made on December 15, 2021.'
        wait: '[AI] The `--wait` flag for the `wineserver` command in Wine (Windows Emulation for Linux) is used to start the Wine server in a mode where it waits for a client to connect and provide instructions. This is typically used when running graphically demanding Windows applications on a headless (without a display) Linux system, as the Wine server can be started in the background without starting a desktop session or GUI, and the application''s window can be controlled remotely using tools like VNC or RDP once a connection has been established.'
