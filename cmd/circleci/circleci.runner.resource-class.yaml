description: Operate on runner resource-classes
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `circleci runner resource-class` command is not a standard CircleCI command as it seems to be specific to certain CircleCI setups or custom scripts. In general terms, this command might be used to configure the resource class for a CircleCI runner. Resource classes define the hardware and software capabilities of a CircleCI runner, allowing you to assign jobs to runners based on their capabilities. By setting the `resource-class` property, you can control which runner will execute your CircleCI workflows. For example, if you have defined different resource classes for CPU-intensive or memory-intensive tasks, this command could be used to ensure that those tasks are executed on runners with the appropriate resource class.'
