documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux lock-client` command is a TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) session manager''s built-in subcommand used to acquire a write lock on an active session from another terminal or session, preventing any further modifications without releasing it. This can be useful when working collaboratively or in situations where multiple users need to ensure that only one person can make changes at a time. It requires the `server` and the `client` to both have TMUX installed and be connected to the same server session.'
    flag:
        t: '[AI] `tmux lock-client -t` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to acquire a session lock. When you run this command with the `-t` option followed by a session name, Tmux sets a lock on the specified session, preventing other users or processes from attaching to it unless they provide the session password or use `tmux attach -f -T <session-name>` with the `-F` flag to break the lock. This can be useful in shared environments where multiple users may attempt to access a single session.'
