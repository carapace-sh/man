documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `newrelic workload create` command is used in New Relic''s CLI (Command Line Interface) to create a new synthetic workload test. Synthetic monitoring allows users to monitor the availability and performance of their applications from multiple locations and user perspectives, even when real user traffic is low or nonexistent. This command takes various options such as workload name, application ID, location, browser type, and test schedule to configure a new synthetic test.'
    flag:
        entityGuid: '[AI] The `newrelic workload create --entityGuid` command is used in New Relic''s command-line interface (CLI) to create a new workload profile with a specific Entity Guid. A workload profile in New Relic represents a collection of application components and their associated infrastructure, allowing for performance monitoring and analysis. The `--entityGuid` option specifies the unique identifier for the entity being monitored, such as an application or a Kubernetes cluster. By invoking this command, you''re instructing New Relic CLI to create a new workload based on the provided Entity Guid.'
        entitySearchQuery: |-
            [AI] The `newrelic workload create` command is used to create a New Relic workload in their Performance product, which helps monitor and analyze application performance over time. The `--entitySearchQuery` option is an argument that allows specifying a query string for filtering entities (such as applications or services) when creating the workload. This can be useful for targeting specific sets of data for analysis. For example:

            ```bash
            newrelic workload create my_workload --entitySearchQuery "appName:myapp AND environment:production"
            ```

            This command creates a new workload named 'my\_workload' that only includes data related to the production environment of the application called 'myapp'.
        name: '[AI] The `newrelic workload create` command is used to create a new workload definition in New Relic, which is a tool for monitoring and managing application performance. The `--name` option sets the name for this new workload definition. This flag is required when creating a new workload using the command-line interface provided by New Relic. It identifies the new workload with a descriptive label to facilitate easier organization and management within the platform.'
        scopeAccountIds: '[AI] The `newrelic workload create` command is used to create a new workload in New Relic One. The option `--scopeAccountIds` allows users to specify one or more account IDs that the workload will apply to. By specifying multiple account IDs, you can create a workload that affects multiple New Relic accounts at once. This can be useful for applying monitoring configurations or other settings consistently across multiple accounts.'
