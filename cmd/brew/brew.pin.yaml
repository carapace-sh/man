    command: '[AI] `brew pin` is a Homebrew command used to lock the version of a specific package at its current installation. This means that Homebrew will not upgrade or downgrade the package, maintaining the current installed version until it is explicitly unpinned with `brew unpin`. It helps in managing dependencies and ensuring consistency across different system configurations.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `brew pin --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to override the Homebrew formula for a specific package and force it to use a pinned version instead. The `--debug` flag enables verbose output during the installation process, providing more detailed information about what Homebrew is doing behind the scenes. This can be helpful when troubleshooting or understanding how Homebrew works under the hood.'

            [AI] The `brew pin` command is a part of Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. It's used to lock a specific version of a Homebrew formula to prevent it from being automatically upgraded.

            When you run `brew pin --help`, you will see the following output:

            ```bash
            Usage: brew pin [formula]

            Pin a formula to its current version, preventing auto-upgrades and deferring
            security vulnerability notices for that formula.

            Options:
              --deferred DEFERRED           Defer security vulnerability notices (default false)
              --force                      Force pinning (even if pinned or already installed)
              --linked LINKED              Pin a linked formula instead of the main one
              --quiet                      Suppress progress and error messages
              --recurse RECURSE             Recursively pin dependencies as well
              --verbose                    Show detailed information about what is being pinned
            ```

            In summary, `brew pin` is a command for locking the version of a Homebrew formula to prevent automatic upgrades and defer security vulnerability notices. The command accepts various options for more granular control, like deferring security notices or recursively pinning dependencies.
        quiet: '[AI] `brew pin --quiet` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `pin` sub-command is used to lock a specific version of a formula or cask (package) and prevent it from being automatically updated in the future. The `--quiet` flag reduces the amount of output during the command''s execution, providing a quieter terminal session.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew pin --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to lock down the version of a specific package or dependency that is currently installed. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output displayed during the command''s execution, providing more detailed information about what Homebrew is doing behind the scenes. Essentially, `brew pin --verbose` locks in a package version and provides comprehensive feedback on the process.'
