        [AI] `sudo replay` is not a standard Linux command. It seems to be a typo or misunderstanding of the `sudo`, `restorecon` and `--verbose` commands.

        The correct command combination would be:
        1. `sudo`: runs a command with administrative privileges.
        2. `restorecon`: a SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) utility that restores the security context of files or directories.
        3. `--verbose`: an option to display detailed information about the actions taken by `restorecon`.

        So, there is no such command as "sudoreplay" in a standard Linux environment.
    flag:
        directory: '[AI] `sudoreplay` is a tool used for privilege escalation and post-exploitation in Linux systems. The command `sudoreplay --directory` is used to replay the collected SUDO privileged access sessions stored in a directory. This allows an attacker to elevate their privileges again, or explore further the compromised system by using the previously recorded SUDO commands.'
        filter: '[AI] `sudo replay` is a command-line tool used to apply changes made in a saved filter file to a system or application. The `--filter` option specifies the path to the filter file that contains the desired changes. In summary, `sudo replay --filter <path-to-filter-file>` applies the contents of the specified filter file to the system or application.'

            [AI] `sudo replay` is a command-line utility used to apply a saved input session, also known as a script or macro, on another system's terminal output. The `--help` option provides a brief explanation of the available commands and their usage when running the `sudo replay` command in a terminal.

            Here's a concise summary of the help information:

            - `sudo replay [OPTIONS] FILE`: Applies the input script specified by the given file to a terminal session.
            - `--help, -h`: Displays this usage message and exit.
            - `--version, -V`: Output version information and exit.

            Usage example: `sudo replay my_input_script.txt`
        list: '[AI] `sudoreplay --list` is a command used in Sudo, a popular access control system for Linux operating systems. This specific command displays a list of available Sudo roles and their corresponding descriptions. Roles define sets of permissions for users or groups, allowing fine-grained access control. The output shows each role name followed by its description, providing an overview of the available configurations for Sudo use.'
        max-wait: '[AI] `sudo replay` is a tool used in debugging and testing kernel modules or system configurations with the SystemTap language. The `--max-wait` option sets a maximum waiting time for SystemTap scripts to finish execution. If a script takes longer than this specified time, it will be forcefully terminated. This can help prevent long running or unresponsive scripts and reduce potential issues during debugging and testing.'
        no-resize: '[AI] `sudoreplay` is a tool used for system image restoration in Linux. The command `sudoreplay --no-resize` instructs it to restore a previously created system image without changing the size of the partitions during the restoration process. This can be useful when the original and target systems have identical partition sizes, ensuring a smooth restoration without potential data loss or partition resizing issues.'
        non-interactive: '[AI] `sudoreplay` is a Linux command-line tool used to replay a previously saved terminal session using sudo privileges. The option `--non-interactive` instructs the tool not to pause and ask for user input during the session replay, allowing automated or scripted execution.'
        speed: '[AI] `sudoreplay --speed` is a command used in forensics and data recovery with the SudoReplay tool. This command replays an existing sudo access log file at an increased speed. By default, the log file playback runs in real-time. However, using `--speed` option increases or decreases the playback speed by a factor specified as an argument (e.g., `--speed 2` for double speed). This feature can be helpful when analyzing large logs to save time or inspect finer details.'
        suspend-wait: '[AI] `sudo replay` is a tool in the `Strace` package used for system call tracing. The option `--suspend-wait` instructs the tool to pause the traced process and wait for the user to continue after each system call is executed. This allows for detailed examination of the system call behavior without interfering with the normal execution flow of the process.'
        version: '[AI] `sudo replay` is a command-line tool for applying pre-recorded input events (also known as macros or scripts) on Linux systems. The `--version` option is used to display the version information of the `sudoreplay` utility, including its name, version number, and other relevant details such as compilation date and author. This can be helpful for checking which version of `sudoreplay` is being used, ensuring compatibility with certain configurations or identifying potential bug fixes or new features in newer versions.'
