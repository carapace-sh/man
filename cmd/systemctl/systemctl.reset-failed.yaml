documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `systemctl reset-failed` command is used in Linux systems with systemd init system to reset the state of all units that have previously failed to start. It does not restart or affect currently running services. Instead, it returns the units to their configured initial states and removes any failure marks from them. This command can be useful when investigating why certain services fail to start on boot and can help in identifying underlying issues by resetting the state of the problematic units before further troubleshooting.'
