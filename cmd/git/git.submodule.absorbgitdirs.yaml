description: Move submodules git dir to superproject
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git submodule absorbgitdirs` is a Git command used to absorb or integrate all the submodules with their own repositories into the main repository as subtrees instead of submodules. This means that the entire history and files of the submodules will be included in the main repository, rather than being stored as separate entities. This can simplify the repository structure and make it easier to manage dependencies between projects. However, note that absorbing submodules cannot be reversed, so use this command with caution.'
