            [AI] The `brew debug` command is a diagnostic tool for Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. It runs the installation or update process with increased output to help identify issues during software installations.

            When you execute `brew install --debug <package>`, Homebrew will provide detailed information on each step it takes, including which files are being installed and any error messages that may arise. Similarly, for an update, use `brew upgrade --debug <package>`. The debug flag helps troubleshoot installation or update problems by providing more extensive diagnostics.

This command displays comprehensive help information about Homebrew and its various sub-commands, their usage, and available options. It provides an overview of how to install, update, remove, and manage software packages using Homebrew. The output includes detailed descriptions, examples, and interactive usage guides to facilitate effective use of the system.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `brew` command with the `--quiet` flag is used to suppress informational messages or output from Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. When you run a Homebrew command followed by `--quiet`, it will execute the command silently without displaying any progress or status messages. This can be useful if you want to run several Homebrew commands in succession and don''t want the extra clutter from each command''s output.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `brew command --verbose` in Homebrew is used to run a Homebrew installation or upgrade command with detailed output. The `--verbose` flag enables verbose mode, which means that Homebrew will print out additional information about each step it takes during the installation or upgrade process. This can be helpful for troubleshooting or understanding what Homebrew is doing behind the scenes.'
