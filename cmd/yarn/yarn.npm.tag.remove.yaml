        [AI] The `yarn npm tag remove` command is not a valid command as it seems to be a combination of two different package managers, Yarn and NPM, with an incorrect usage of NPM's `tag` command.

        NPM's `tag` command is used for managing tags in a Git-linked repository, and it doesn't support removing specific tags directly. If you want to remove a local tag, use Git commands instead. For example, you can use `git tag delete <tag>`.

        If you meant to remove a tag from the npm registry using Yarn, there isn't a built-in Yarn command for that. Instead, use the npm CLI with your Yarn login credentials:

        ```bash
        npm login --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
        npm remove <package>@<tag> --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
        ```

        Replace `<package>` and `<tag>` with the appropriate values for your use case. Remember to log in using your npm account credentials, or set up a `~/.npmrc` file with the necessary authentication information before running these commands.
