    --owner-root: use 'root' as the owner of files and dirs
    --path*=: only consider snapshots which include this (absolute) `path`
    --snapshot-template=: set `template` to use for snapshot dirs

documentation:
    command: '[AI] `restic mount` is a command from the restic backup tool. It''s used to mount a specific backup repository as a read-only file system in Linux. This allows users to access and restore files directly from the backup without having to perform a full restoration of the entire backup set. The syntax is typically `restic mount REPOSITORY_PATH MOUNT_POINT --read-only`. Replace `REPOSITORY_PATH` with the path to your backup repository, and `MOUNT_POINT` with the desired mount point for the file system.'
    flag:
        allow-other: '[AI] The `restic mount` command in `restic`, a backup program, is used to mount a remote repository as a local file system for easy access and faster backups. The option `--allow-other` grants read and write permissions to all other users on the mounted filesystem. This means that any user can read or write data in the mounted directory, making it useful when multiple users need to access the same backup data.'
        host: |-
            [AI] The `restic mount --host` command is used in the data backup and synchronization tool called 'restic'. This command is responsible for mounting a remote repository over the Network File System (NFS) or other network protocols, making it accessible as a local directory.

            The `--host` flag specifies the hostname or IP address of the remote server that hosts the restic repository. By executing this command, you enable read and write access to the backup data stored on the remote repository from your local machine, allowing for efficient data transfer and retrieval.
        no-default-permissions: '[AI] The `restic mount` command is a feature of the data backup tool, `restic`. It allows you to mount backups as filesystems for easy access and restoration. The option `--no-default-permissions` tells restic not to set default file permissions on mounted directories or files. By using this flag, you retain control over the permissions of the mounted data and can manage them as desired in your file explorer or other tools. It''s useful when working with systems that have specific permission requirements or when collaborating with team members who need access to different levels of data.'
        owner-root: '[AI] `restic mount` is a command from the restic backup tool used to mount a restored file or directory as a read-only filesystem in Linux. The `--owner-root` option sets the owner of the mounted files and directories to be the root user (0). This may be necessary in some cases, such as when accessing the mounted data from other processes or users that do not have the same UID as the original file owner. Without this option, the restored files would keep their original ownership and might cause access issues when mounted.'
        path: '[AI] `restic mount --path` is a command used with the data backup tool, `restic`. It mounts a previously created backup archive as a filesystem. The `--path` option specifies the local path where the backup archive resides. Once mounted, the files within the archive can be accessed as if they were in a regular filesystem. This feature is useful for easily accessing individual files from the backup without having to perform a full restore.'
        snapshot-template: '[AI] `restic mount --snapshot-template` is a command in the Restic backup tool. This command is used to mount a specific snapshot as a read-only file system in Linux. The `--snapshot-template` option specifies a template for naming the mount point and the snapshot to be mounted. The template can include placeholders for the snapshot''s name, timestamp, and other metadata. For example, a template could be "/mnt/backups/mount_{{.Name}}-{{.Time.Format "2006-01-02"}}". When this command is run, Restic will automatically select a snapshot based on the given criteria (such as the most recent one), and then mount it using the specified template. This allows for easy access to specific snapshots as file systems for browsing and data recovery.'
        tag: '[AI] The `restic mount --tag` command is a feature of the backup tool Restic. This command is used to mount a specific tag (a named point in version history) as if it were a file system, allowing direct access to the data at that point in time. This can be useful for restoring individual files or directories without having to perform a full backup restoration. The `--tag` option specifies which tag should be mounted.'
