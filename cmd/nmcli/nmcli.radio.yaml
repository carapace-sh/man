documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nmcli radio` command is used to manage wireless connectivity in the NetworkManager service of Linux systems. It allows you to view, enable or disable the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios, as well as scan for available networks. Without any further options, the default behavior is to display the current status of your wireless interfaces. For example: `nmcli radio wifi on` turns on Wi-Fi or `nmcli device wifi rescan` initiates a new scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks.'
