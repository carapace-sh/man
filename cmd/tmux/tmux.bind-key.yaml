description: bind a key to a command
flags:
    -N=: attach a note to the key
    -T=: specify key table for the binding
    -n: make the binding work without the need for the prefix key
    -r: the key may repeat
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `bind-key` command in TMUX is used to define or modify keyboard shortcuts for various actions within the terminal multiplexer. The basic format is: `bind-key <key> <command>`, where `<key>` represents the key combination (single key or a sequence) and `<command>` specifies the action to be executed when that key combination is pressed. For example, `bind-key C-b prefix` sets `Ctrl+b` as the prefix key for issuing TMUX commands.'
    flag:
        "N": |-
            [AI] The `bind-key` command in TMUX with the `-N` flag is used to create or modify a binding for a new, unnamed key combination. In other words, it allows users to define custom shortcuts within TMUX.

            For example, `bind-key -N q split-window -h` assigns the 'q' key to split the horizontal window in TMUX. Users can replace 'q' with any other unassigned key they prefer and use this command to create custom shortcuts according to their needs.
        T: '[AI] The `bind-key` command with the `-T` flag in TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) is used to create or modify a key binding for specific target windows, panes, or sessions based on their terminal title. The syntax is `bind-key <key> <command>:<target-condition>`. For example, `bind-key c created:session -T "my_terminal" new-session` creates a new session with the name "my\_terminal" when key ''c'' is pressed in the terminal title matching "my\_terminal". This can be useful for creating complex workflows and automating common tasks within TMUX.'
        "n": '[AI] `tmux bind-key` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer used to define custom key bindings for various tmux actions. The `-n` option specifies the key binding by its name (as a string), while without `-n`, it uses the keycode directly. For example, `bind-key C-b` sets the default binding for the prefix key (Ctrl-B) in tmux, whereas `bind-key -n mykey C-x e` creates a new binding named "mykey" using the key combination Ctrl-X and the letter ''e''.'
        r: '[AI] `tmux bind-key` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer used to define or modify key bindings. The `-r` flag specifies that the existing binding for a given key should be removed, allowing you to rebind that key to a new command or function within tmux.'
