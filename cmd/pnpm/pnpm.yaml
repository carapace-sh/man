    command: '[AI] `pnpm` is a package manager for JavaScript projects, similar to npm or Yarn. It stands for "Parallel NPM" and is designed to install packages in parallel for faster build times. Instead of downloading each package one after another like traditional package managers, pnpm downloads multiple packages at once, improving the installation process for larger projects. Additionally, pnpm uses a dedicated local cache per project, allowing it to work more efficiently with multi-repository projects.'
