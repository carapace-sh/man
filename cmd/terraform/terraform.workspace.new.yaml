documentation:
    command: '[AI] `terraform workspace new` is a Terraform command used to create a new workspace, also known as a "state file," in Terraform''s internal state management system. This command helps you manage multiple configuration sets for different environments or projects within the same directory by isolating their respective states and configurations. When you create a new workspace using this command, Terraform generates a new unique name for it, unless you provide one as an argument. Once created, you can selectively apply and manage resources in the desired workspace with `terraform apply` or other related commands.'
    flag:
        lock: '[AI] `terraform workspace new` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Terraform configuration management tool to create a new work directory or switch to an existing one in Terraform''s state file. The `-lock` flag, when used with this command, creates a lock file in the newly created or selected workspace. This lock file prevents other users from making changes to the same workspace simultaneously, ensuring that your Terraform configurations are applied in a controlled and consistent manner.'
        lock-timeout: '[AI] `terraform workspace new` is a command in Hashicorp''s Terraform configuration management tool used to create a new workspace, which is essentially a separate directory or environment for managing resources. The `-lock-timeout` option sets the length of time (in seconds) that Terraform should hold a lock on the state file for this specific workspace when multiple users might be working on the same infrastructure. This helps prevent conflicts by ensuring only one person can make changes to the resources in the workspace at any given time.'
        state: '[AI] `terraform workspace new` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Terraform configuration management tool. It creates a new workspace (an isolated environment for managing multiple Terraform configurations) with an initial empty state file. An empty state file signifies that there are no resources or data being managed in that workspace yet. Subsequent `apply` commands will populate the state file as infrastructure is provisioned and configured according to the defined Terraform configuration files.'
