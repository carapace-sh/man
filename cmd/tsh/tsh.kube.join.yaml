documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tsh kube join` is a command used in Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) environment for joining existing clusters to a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid cluster management cluster. This command is typically run on a new worker node that needs to be added to an existing TKG-managed Kubernetes cluster. The `tsh kube join` command requires the token and the address of the Kubernetes control plane as arguments, and it configures the newly joined worker node with the necessary settings to become a part of the managed cluster. This process ensures that the new node is able to communicate with other nodes in the cluster, and it can be managed by Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.'
    flag:
        cluster: '[AI] The `kubeadm tsh join --cluster` flag is used to join a new node to an existing Kubernetes cluster using the TSH (Temporarily Served Host) mode in Kubeadm. This method allows a worker node to connect to the master node without requiring a pre-existing certificate or key. The `--cluster` option specifies the name or IP address of the Kubernetes cluster to join, and other necessary configurations will be downloaded automatically from the master node. Once joined, the new node becomes part of the cluster and can run workloads as a worker node.'
        mode: '[AI] `tsh kube join --mode` is a command used in Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) to join existing clusters to a Tanzu Kubernetes Mission Control cluster for centralized management. The `--mode` flag specifies the type of joining: either "worker" for nodes that will run workloads, or "manager" for nodes that will manage the cluster. This command automates the process of configuring and joining nodes to the TKG-managed Kubernetes clusters.'
