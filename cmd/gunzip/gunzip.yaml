documentation:
    command: '[AI] "gunzip" is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems for extracting compressed data from .gz files using the gzip compression algorithm. When you run "gunzip" followed by the name of the .gz file, it will decompress and overwrite the original file with its uncompressed version while preserving the original filename. If used with the "-c" option, it will instead print the uncompressed data to standard output rather than saving a new file.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `gunzip` is a command-line utility used in Unix-based systems for extracting files compressed with the Gzip (gzip or gzip with extension .gz) format. The `--force` option is an argument provided to `gunzip`. When this option is used, `gunzip` will attempt to overwrite existing files without asking for confirmation during extraction. In summary, using `gunzip --force` will extract the compressed file and overwrite any existing files with the same name in the destination directory.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `gunzip` is a command-line utility in Unix-based systems for extracting the contents of gzipped files. The option `--help` is used to display detailed information about how to use `gunzip`. When you type `gunzip --help`, the terminal will show a message containing:

            * Brief description of what `gunzip` does, i.e., "This is the gunzip command"
            * Detailed usage information with examples, such as `gunzip <filename.gz>` or `gunzip <input.gz > output`
            * List of available options, which can include:
              * `-c`: Output the contents of files to standard output instead of extracting them to files
              * `-f`: Force extraction of gzipped files even if they have already been extracted or their names are not recognized as valid gzip filenames
              * `-n`: Extract only named files, ignoring all others
              * `-t`: Test extracting a file without actually extracting it
              * `-v`: Display progress messages and the size of each extracted file.
        keep: '[AI] The `gunzip` command is a utility in Unix-based systems used to compress and decompress files with the .gz extension using the gzip algorithm. The option `--keep` tells gunzip to preserve the original compressed file after decompression, leaving both the original compressed file and the decompressed file in the file system. This can be useful when you want to keep a backup of the compressed file or if you need to perform further operations on it later.'
        list: '[AI] `gunzip --list` is a command used with the GNU Gunzip utility to list the names of the files that will be decompressed without actually extracting their contents. The `--list` option causes Gunzip to only print out the names of the input files and the corresponding output files that would be created during the decompression process.'
        name: '[AI] `gunzip` is a command-line utility used to extract files from gzipped formats, such as .gz or .gzip. The option `--name` is used with `gunzip` to extract the original file name(s) from the compressed file without actually extracting the data itself. This can be useful when working with large files and wanting to maintain a list of filenames for further processing.'
        no-name: '[AI] `gunzip` is a command-line utility used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems for extracting compressed data using the gzip format. The option `--no-name` tells `gunzip` not to restore the original file name during extraction, meaning the extracted files will be saved as `stdout.gz`, the default output file extension being replaced with `.gz`. This can be useful when dealing with large numbers of files or automating processes.'
        quiet: '[AI] `gunzip --quiet` is a command used in Unix-based systems to extract the contents of compressed .gz files using the Gunzip utility. The `--quiet` option suppresses all output from Gunzip, making the extraction process run in the background without displaying any progress messages or status updates. This can be useful when automating processes or running multiple commands in a script.'
        recursive: '[AI] `gunzip` is a utility in Unix-like operating systems used to compress and decompress files with the gzip format. The option `--recursive` (or `-r`) tells `gunzip` to process files recursively in a directory and its subdirectories, automatically decompressing any gzipped files found therein. So, running `gunzip --recursive <directory>` will attempt to decompress all gzipped files within the specified directory and its nested directories.'
        stdout: '[AI] `gunzip --stdout` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to extract the contents of a gzipped file in standard output stream format. The "--stdout" option specifies that the output should be written to the standard output instead of a file. In other words, this command uncompresses a gzipped file and sends the decompressed data directly to the terminal or another process for further usage without writing it to a file.'
        suffix: '[AI] The `gunzip` command is a utility in GNU Zip (gzip) for extracting files compressed with the gzip compression method. The option `--suffix` tells gunzip to preserve the original file suffix after decompression. By default, gunzip would remove any suffixes starting with ''.gz'' when uncompressing files. With this option, you can maintain any other suffix that might be present in the original filename, such as ''.tar.gz''. This can be useful when dealing with archive formats like Tarballs (.tar.gz) and TGZips (.tgz).'
        test: '[AI] `gunzip --test` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to test if a file has been compressed using the gzip compression algorithm without actually decompressing it. The `--test` option checks the compressional integrity of the file by calculating its Adler-32 checksum and comparing it with the checksum stored in the last 10 bytes of the file. If they match, the command indicates that the file is validly compressed with gzip.'
        verbose: '[AI] `gunzip --verbose` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems to extract the contents of compressed files using the gzip compression algorithm. The `--verbose` option enables detailed output during the extraction process, displaying information such as the input file name, output file name, and the percentage and estimated time remaining for each segment of the decompression process.'
        version: '[AI] `gunzip --version` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to check the version information of the "gunzip" utility installed on the system. Gunzip is a data compression tool that is primarily used for extracting files from gzipped formats (.gz). By running this command, the user can view the specific version number and other relevant details about the installed gunzip application, including any associated compilation options or release dates.'
