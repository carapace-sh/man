    command: '[AI] `i3status` is a lightweight system status monitor and bar display application for the i3 window manager. It provides real-time information about the system, including the battery level (if applicable), Wi-Fi signal strength, CPU usage, memory usage, and other relevant data. It can be configured to show this information in a bar at the top or bottom of the screen. The command is typically run in the background using `i3status &`, with its output being displayed in the i3bar configuration file.'
    flag:
        c: '[AI] `i3status -c` is a command used in the i3 window manager for Linux. The `-c` option tells i3status to output its output as plain text, in a format that can be parsed and used by other programs. This is often used to display information such as the current workspace, window titles, and battery levels in the status bar of i3wm. The output is typically piped to another command or script for further processing.'
