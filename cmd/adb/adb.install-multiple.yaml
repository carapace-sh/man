documentation:
    command: '[AI] `adb install-multiple` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to install multiple APK files on an Android device at once. This command takes a list of APK files as arguments, which can be provided in the form of a text file or by specifying multiple filenames separated by spaces. The command then sends these APKs to the device and installs them without any user interaction required on the device side.'
    flag:
        d: '[AI] `adb install-multiple -d` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to install multiple APK files on an Android device in debug mode. The "-d" option specifies that the installed apps should replace any currently installed instances with the same package name. This means that if there''s already an app with the same name on the device, it will be uninstalled and then replaced by the new one during the installation process. The "install-multiple" command allows for installing multiple APK files in one go, by providing a list of files as arguments.'
        g: '[AI] `adb install-multiple` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to install multiple APK files on an Android device at once. The `-g` option stands for "grant permissions" and requests that the installed apps be granted all the required permissions. With this command, you can efficiently push multiple apps to a device and grant them necessary permissions in one go.'
        instant: '[AI] `adb install-multiple` is a command-line tool in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) that allows installation of multiple APK files on an Android device at once. The `--instant` flag is an optional argument, which enables the "instant app" feature during the installation process. Instant apps are smaller, modular components of larger apps that can be downloaded and run directly from the link without requiring a full installation. With `adb install-multiple --instant`, you can install multiple instant apps in one go, providing a more efficient way to deploy and test these applications on an Android device.'
        l: '[AI] `adb install-multiple` is a command-line tool used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to install multiple APK files on an Android device or emulator without having to run the `adb install` command separately for each file. The `-l` flag, also known as `--list`, is optional and it displays a list of all APK files present in the current directory before installation. This can help ensure that the correct APKs are being installed and provides transparency during the process.'
        r: '[AI] `adb install-multiple` is a command-line tool in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) used for installing multiple APK files on an Android device or emulator in one go. The `-r` flag stands for "replacement," meaning that if there''s already an app with the same package name on the target device, it will be replaced by the new installation. This command is useful when managing multiple instances of the same app on a device for testing purposes or when updating apps silently without user intervention.'
        s: '[AI] `adb install-multiple` is a command-line tool in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) used to install multiple APK files onto an Android device or emulator, in one go. The `-s` option specifies the serial number or device ID of the target device. For example: `adb install-multiple -s <device_serial> <path1>/app1.apk <path2>/app2.apk`. This command simplifies the process of sideloading multiple apps at once.'
        t: '[AI] `adb install-multiple` is a command-line tool used in Android Development using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). The `-t` option is a flag that specifies the type of files to be installed on an Android device. When using this flag with `install-multiple`, it installs multiple APK files in the batch mode without any user interaction required on the device. This can be useful for installing multiple apps at once or automating app deployment processes.'
