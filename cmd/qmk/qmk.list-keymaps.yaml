    command: '[AI] The `qmk list-keymaps` command is a utility function in QMK Firmware, an open-source firmware for keyboards. This command lists all available keymap names registered in the current QMK project directory. It helps users identify and manage different keymap configurations within their keyboard project.'

        help: |-
            [AI] The `qmk list-keymaps --help` command is used in the QMK keyboard firmware to display available keymap names and their corresponding directories. It provides information on how to filter and output the results. Here's a brief explanation of its help message:

            ```sh
            Usage: qmk list-keymaps [OPTIONS]...

            List all available keymaps in the current QMK repository

            Options:
              --help                     Show this message and exit.
              --search PATTERN            Search for a keymap by its name or description (case insensitive).
              -v, --verbose              Output detailed information about each keymap.
              --json                      Output results in JSON format.
              --quiet                     Suppress informational messages.
            ```

            In simple terms, use `qmk list-keymaps` without any options to list all available keymaps. Use the `--search` option followed by a pattern to search for specific keymaps. The `--verbose`, `--json`, and `--quiet` options can be used to modify the output format or behavior.
        keyboard: '[AI] `qmk list-keymaps --keyboard` is a command used in the QMK firmware for Keyboard Firmware Development. It lists all available keymap files for a specific keyboard configuration. The `--keyboard` option specifies the name or identifier of the keyboard for which to list the keymaps. This command helps developers and users to identify and manage different keymap setups for their QMK-based keyboards.'
