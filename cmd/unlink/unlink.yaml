        [AI] The `unlink` command in Unix-based systems is used to remove a file or a hard link to a file from the file system. When you run `unlink filename`, it deletes the file named "filename" if it exists and is not a directory. If the file has any open processes or other links pointing to it, `unlink` will fail.

        Additionally, there's also the `rm` command (remove), which can be used for similar purposes but provides more options like recursively removing directories or interactively prompting before deletion. However, `unlink` is typically used in shell scripts and programs for simpler file manipulation tasks since it does not display any confirmation messages by default.
    flag:
        help: |-
            [AI] The `unlink` command in Unix-based systems is used for removing files or directories by their names. When you run `unlink --help`, you will see a detailed explanation of the various options that can be used with this command:

            1. `--force, -f`: Remove files or directories without asking for confirmation.
            2. `--quiet, -q`: Suppress all output except errors.
            3. `--interactive, -i`: Prompt before removing each file or directory.
            4. `--recursive, -R`: Remove directories and their contents recursively.
            5. `--verbose, -v`: Print a message for each file processed.
            6. `--help`: Display this help information and exit.
            7. `--version`: Show the version of unlink and exit.
        version: '[AI] `unlink --version` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems, specifically in the bash shell, to display the version information of the `unlink` utility. The `unlink` command is used for removing files or directories from a file system. When followed by `--version`, it will output the name and version number of the unlink utility installed on your system.'
