documentation:
    command: '[AI] `adb wait-for-local-bootloader` is a command used with Android Debug Bridge (ADB). It causes ADB to wait for the local Android device to enter the bootloader mode before executing subsequent commands. This command is useful when working with custom recoveries or modifications that require access to the bootloader, as it ensures that the device is indeed in the desired state before continuing.'
