        app: '[AI] The `waypoint project apply --app` command is used in Google Cloud''s Waypoint tool for Kubernetes deployment. This command applies or creates a new Kubernetes application in an existing Waypoint-managed project using the specific app definition file. It ensures that the desired configuration of the application is deployed to the targeted Kubernetes cluster.'
        app-status-poll: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint project apply --app-status-poll"` is used with Waypoint, an open-source GitOps tool for Kubernetes. This flag instructs Waypoint to continuously poll the application status of the specified project during the application deployment process. By enabling this flag, users can monitor the progress and health of their applications in real time and receive updates on any changes or errors that occur throughout the deployment workflow.'
        app-status-poll-interval: '[AI] The `--app-status-poll-interval` flag in the `kubectl waypoint project apply` command is used to configure the interval at which Kubewaypoint (a part of the Waypoint project) checks the application status when deploying or updating applications. This flag sets the time duration between each polling attempt, allowing users to customize the frequency of status checks according to their specific requirements. For instance, a smaller interval may be desirable in scenarios where quick feedback on the deployment status is essential, while larger intervals could help reduce unnecessary network traffic and resource usage.'
        data-source: '[AI] The `--data-source` option in the `waypoint project apply` command is used to specify the location or source of the configuration data that Waypoint, an open-source infrastructure automation tool by Hashicorp, should use when applying changes to a project. It can be set to various sources such as a local file, a Git repository, or an external API endpoint, depending on how your Waypoint configurations are managed and stored. This allows for declarative management of infrastructure and maintaining consistency across environments.'
        from-waypoint-hcl: '[AI] `flag "apply" in the Waypoint project''s CLI (Command Line Interface) is used to apply HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) configuration files defined in the Waypoint project. The `--from-waypoint-hcl` flag specifies that the configuration files to be applied are stored within the Waypoint project itself, rather than external sources such as git repositories or local files. This allows for a declarative and versioned approach to managing infrastructure and configurations using Waypoint.'
        git-auth-type: '[AI] The `--git-auth-type` option in the `waypoint project apply` command is used to specify the type of Git authentication method to use when applying a Waypoint project configuration that includes Git repositories. Waypoint supports multiple Git authentication types such as SSH keys, HTTP basic auth, and OAuth. By providing the appropriate `--git-auth-type` value, you can ensure that Waypoint uses the correct method for authenticating with the Git repository during application of the project configuration.'
        git-password: '[AI] The `waypoint project apply` command is a tool from Hashicorp''s Waypoint open-source infrastructure automation platform. It is used to deploy and manage infrastructure configurations across multiple cloud providers. The `--git-password` flag is an optional argument for this command, which allows providing the GitHub personal access token as plain text instead of using other methods like SSH keys or environment variables. This can be useful in certain workflows where using a token as an argument is more convenient, but it''s important to note that hardcoding sensitive information like this should be avoided in practice and replaced with more secure methods such as using environment variables or encrypted configuration files.'
        git-path: '[AI] The `waypoint project apply` command is a tool in Google Cloud''s Waypoint configuration management system. It''s used to deploy or update configured resources based on YAML manifests. The `--git-path` option specifies the local Git repository path of the project or module to be applied. It tells Waypoint where to find the configuration files for applying the changes.'

            [AI] The `waypoint project apply` command is a tool from Hashicorp's Waypoint infrastructure automation solution. It is used to deploy and manage cloud resources based on configuration files written in HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language).

            The option `--git-private-key-password` is a flag that provides the password for a Git private key used for SSH authentication when fetching or cloning Git repositories. This is necessary when the Git server uses passphrase protection on its private keys, and you don't want to leave the passphrase in an easily accessible file or environment variable. By using this flag, you securely provide the password only during the execution of the command.
        git-private-key-path: '[AI] The `waypoint project apply` command is a utility in Hashicorp''s Waypoint infrastructure automation tool. This command is used to deploy and manage projects defined in Waypoint configuration files. The `--git-private-key-path` flag specifies the local file path to the private key that will be used for Git operations, such as cloning or pulling changes from repositories, during project deployment. This ensures secure access to the version control system when interacting with remote infrastructure.'
        git-ref: '[AI] The `waypoint project apply` command is a tool from Google''s Waypoint configuration management system used to apply changes to cloud resources. The `--git-ref` option is a parameter passed with this command, specifying the Git reference (branch name or commit hash) to use when pulling the latest configuration files for the project from the source repository before applying the changes. In simpler terms, it fetches the desired Git reference and applies the associated configuration updates to the target resources.'
        git-url: '[AI] The `waypoint project apply --git-url` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool to create or update a new project from a Git repository. The `--git-url` flag specifies the URL of the Git repository containing the desired project configuration files. Once applied, Waypoint will initialize a new working directory for the project and configure it based on the provided repository content.'
        git-username: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint project apply` command is a tool from Google's Waypoint infrastructure configuration management system. It's used to apply changes to cloud resources, such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Amazon Web Services (AWS), based on configuration files defined using HCL language.

            The option `--git-username` is passed when invoking this command and specifies the Git username to use for committing changes made by Waypoint during resource application. It's essential when you are working with version control systems, especially when collaborating with others on your infrastructure configuration.
        plain: '[AI] The `waypoint project apply --plain` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source multi-cloud application delivery platform by Docker. This command applies a Waypoint project configuration and deploys the associated resources to the target infrastructure without displaying detailed output or progress bars. The `--plain` flag is optional but enables a minimal output mode.'
        poll: '[AI] The `waypoint project apply --poll` command is a part of Google''s Waypoint configuration management tool. This command is used to apply changes to infrastructure resources in a Kubernetes cluster, and it includes a polling option. With the `--poll` flag, Waypoint will automatically check for updates to your configuration files at regular intervals until the desired state is reached. It can be useful when dealing with slow or intermittent changes, allowing you to ensure that your infrastructure stays in sync with your desired configuration.'
        poll-interval: '[AI] The `--poll-interval` flag in the `waypoint project apply` command is used to specify the interval at which Waypoint should check for changes in your Kubernetes configuration files and reapply them if necessary. This can be useful when making frequent updates to your application configurations, as it allows you to avoid manual reapplications and ensures that your cluster remains in sync with your desired state. The flag takes a duration value, such as "30s" or "15m", indicating how often Waypoint should check for changes.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint project apply --project` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source multi-cloud application delivery platform by Hashicorp. This command is applied to create or update a specific project definition in the Waypoint configuration. The project is defined using a `.hcl` file that contains metadata and settings for the infrastructure components and applications to be deployed. By providing the path to the project file, the command will apply the changes to the running Waypoint setup.'
        runner-profile: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint project apply --runner-profile"` is used with Google Cloud''s Waypoint CLI tool to specify the runner profile when applying infrastructure changes to a Google Cloud Platform project. A runner profile defines the configuration for executing tasks, such as the machine type and operating system, used by Waypoint''s continuous deployment workflows. By providing this flag, you ensure that your desired runner configuration is utilized during the apply process.'
        waypoint-hcl: '[AI] The `waypoint project apply` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint infrastructure automation tool to apply configuration changes defined in HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) files to target resources. The `--waypoint-hcl` flag specifies that the input for applying the changes comes from one or more HCL files instead of using Waypoint''s built-in configuration sources, like modules or data sources. Using this flag allows users to apply configurations stored in external HCL files, making it a flexible and powerful way to manage infrastructure configurations.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint project apply --workspace` command is used in Google Cloud''s Waypoint tool to apply configuration changes to one or more projects within a specific Waypoint workspace.
