        [AI] `tmux set-buffer` is a TMUX command used to modify the contents of the current terminal pane or buffer in a TMUX session. The basic syntax is as follows: `tmux set-buffer [-p] [-q] [-r string] [-T title] [window-id | pane-id | $SESSION:[window-index|pane-index]]`.

        * `-p`: Prints the current buffer content on the standard output without modifying it.
        * `-q`: Quiet mode, no message is displayed when an error occurs or operation is successful.
        * `-r string`: Replace the existing buffer content with the new string.
        * `-T title`: Set the title of the window containing the pane.
        * The last argument (window-id | pane-id | $SESSION:[window-index|pane-index]) specifies the target window or pane where you want to set the buffer.

        Examples:

        1. To print the current buffer content without modification, use: `tmux set-buffer -p <window_or_pane_id>`.
        2. To replace the buffer content with "Hello World", use: `tmux set-buffer -r "Hello World" <window_or_pane_id>`.
        3. To modify buffer content and set window title, use: `tmux set-buffer -T "My new Title" -r "New content" <window_or_pane_id>`.
    flag:
        a: '[AI] The `tmux` command `set-buffer -a` is used to swap the contents of two adjacent buffers in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. The `-a` option indicates that the next argument specifies the buffer ID to swap with the current buffer. For example, `set-buffer -a 0 1` would swap the contents of buffer 0 and buffer 1. This can be useful for quickly moving between different parts of a long-running command or script in separate buffers within Tmux.'
        b: '[AI] `tmux set-buffer` is a Tmux command used to modify the content of a buffer in a Tmux pane or window. The `-b` option specifies that the modification should be applied to the named buffer instead of the current one. For example, `tmux set-buffer -b my-buffer "new content"` sets the content of the buffer named `my-buffer` to `"new content"`.'
        "n": '[AI] The `tmux` command `set-buffer -n` is used to set the content of the active window''s buffer in a `tmux` session. The `-n` option specifies that the new buffer should be named by the given argument, rather than using the number of the next available buffer. This can be useful when you want to give a descriptive name to the buffer for easy identification later. For example, `tmux set-buffer -n my_buffer "Hello World"` would set the content of the active window''s buffer to "Hello World" and give it the name "my\_buffer".'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux` command `set-buffer` with the option `-t <window-title>` is used to set the content of the buffer associated with a named window or tab in a `tmux` terminal multiplexer session. This allows users to easily switch between different buffers and workspaces within their terminal session. For example, `tmux set-buffer -t main my_command -- create a new buffer in a window named ''main'' and run the command ''my_command'' in it.'
        w: '[AI] The `tmux` command `set-buffer -w` is used to synchronize the contents of the active pane''s buffer with the terminal''s window, effectively writing the buffer back to the terminal. This can be useful in situations where you have made changes to the buffer within `tmux` that you want to persist beyond the session, such as editing a file or running a command. The `-w` flag indicates that this operation should be performed on the whole window (i.e., all panes), not just the active pane.'
