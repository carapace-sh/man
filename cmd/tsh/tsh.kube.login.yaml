documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tsh kube login` is a command used in the Tectonic by CoreOS stack, which is based on Kubernetes. This command is used to log into a remote Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl configuration stored in the Tectonic Secrets Manager. The command retrieves and applies the necessary kubectl configuration, allowing you to manage resources in that cluster.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `tsh kube login --all` is a command used in the Tanzu CLI (Tsh) tool, which is part of the Tanzu Application Platform (TAP) by VMware. This command is used to log in to all the configured Kubernetes clusters in your TAP environment at once. It simplifies the process of managing multiple contexts and saves time when working across multiple clusters.'
        as: '[AI] The `tsh` (Tilt Shift Helm) CLI command `kube login --as` is used to log into a Kubernetes cluster with specific context or identity. The `--as` flag allows you to specify the name of a context (a set of configurations for connecting to a remote cluster, including client certificate, user name and URL), saved in your local `kubeconfig` file, to use for authentication. When used with Tilt Shift Helm, it logs into the specified Kubernetes context before deploying or managing applications.'
        as-groups: '[AI] `tsh kube login --as-groups` is a command using the Kubernetes TSH (kubectl shorthand) tool to log into a remote Kubernetes cluster. The `--as-groups` option allows you to log in with one or more group identities instead of just a user identity. This can be useful when you need to manage resources that require specific RBAC permissions assigned to the groups, rather than individual users. It''s important to note that using this flag assumes proper cluster configuration and appropriate permissions set for the groups.'
        cluster: |-
            [AI] `tsh` is short for Tanzu CLI, which is a command-line interface tool for managing applications and workloads on Tanzu platforms, including Kubernetes clusters. The `kubectl` command within `tsh` is used to manage Kubernetes clusters.

            The command `tsh kube login --cluster` followed by the cluster name is used to log in or switch to a specific Kubernetes cluster that has already been configured with appropriate access credentials, such as a `kubeconfig` file or an OIDC provider. This command sets the current context in your local `kubeconfig` file for the specified cluster. After logging in, you can use other `tsh` or `kubectl` commands to manage resources within that cluster.
        kube-namespace: '[AI] `tsh` is a Tanzu CLI tool for managing applications and infrastructure built on top of Tanzu Kubernetes Grid. The command `tsh kube login --kube-namespace` is used to log in to a specific namespace within a remote Kubernetes cluster, instead of the default one. The `--kube-namespace` flag allows you to specify the target namespace as an argument. This can be useful when working with multiple namespaces or when following best practices for multi-tenancy in a Kubernetes environment.'
        no-all: |-
            [AI] `tsh` is short for Tilt Shift Helm, a popular tool used in Kubernetes development for managing Helm charts and applying local changes to remote clusters. The command `tsh kube login --no-all` is used to log into a specific Kubernetes cluster instead of all the clusters configured in your `kubeconfig`.

            The `--no-all` flag ensures that only the specified cluster is affected by the login command, preventing potential mistakes or unwanted changes to other clusters. After logging into the desired cluster, you can continue managing and deploying applications as needed.
        set-context-name: |-
            [AI] `tsh kube login --set-context-name` is a command used with the `kubectl` tool, specifically the `tksh` (Temporal Kubernetes Shell) wrapper. This command facilitates logging into a remote Kubernetes cluster using your local kubeconfig file and then sets or updates the context name for that cluster in your kubeconfig.

            Here's a more detailed breakdown:

            1. `tsh`: Temporal Kubernetes Shell is an extension to `kubectl` that provides additional functionality and convenience, such as easy switching between different clusters.
            2. `kube login`: This command logs into a specified remote Kubernetes cluster by authenticating with the cluster's API server using information from your local kubeconfig file.
            3. `--set-context-name`: This option sets or updates the context name in your local kubeconfig for the logged-in cluster. By default, the new context is given a descriptive name based on the cluster's host and port, but you can provide a custom context name using this option.

            In summary, `tsh kube login --set-context-name` logs into a remote Kubernetes cluster and sets or updates the context name in your local kubeconfig file for easy switching between clusters using the Temporal Kubernetes Shell.
