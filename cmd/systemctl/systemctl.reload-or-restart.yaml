documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl reload-or-restart` is a command used in systemd-based Linux distributions to either reload or restart a particular service. The command checks if the service already has an active process, if so it will send a SIGTERM signal to stop the process and then start a new one. If the service was not running, it will simply attempt to start a new instance of the service. This command is useful when changes have been made to a configuration file or when troubleshooting a misbehaving service.'
