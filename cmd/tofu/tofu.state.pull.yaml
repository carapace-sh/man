    command: '[AI] The `tofu state pull` command is used in Kubernetes to update a local Git repository with the latest changes from a remote repository, specifically within the context of using Tofu, a GitOps tool for Kubernetes configuration management. This command fetches new commits, merges them into the current branch and updates the working directory, preparing it for further `kubectl apply` operations to synchronize the local Kubernetes cluster with the desired state described in the Git repository.'
