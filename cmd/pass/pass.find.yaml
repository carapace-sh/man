        [AI] The `pass find` command is a part of GnuPG's (GNU Privacy Guard) Password Manager, `gnupg-2.1.x`, and above versions. It is used to search for an entry in the GPG keyring by providing certain identification properties such as email address, user ID or fingerprint.

        The basic syntax of the command is:
        ```
        pass find [keyid|email|fpr|uid] [string]
        ```
        Here, `[keyid|email|fpr|uid]` represents the identification property to search by, and `[string]` is an optional string that can be used as a partial match for the search. If no property or string is provided, it searches for all entries matching the given criteria.

        For example:
        ```
        pass find email john@example.com
        pass find uid John Doe
        pass find fpr 0x123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789
        ```
        These commands will search for an entry with the respective email address, user ID or fingerprint. If you want to find entries that contain 'example' in their user IDs, use:
        ```
        pass find uid *example*
        ```
