documentation:
    command: '[AI] `glab mr checkout` is a GitLab CLI command used to check out a merge request (MR) branch locally. When you run this command, it fetches the MR branch and creates a new local branch with the name "<remote_name>/<merge_request_id>" or "<branch_name>" if no remote is given. After checking out the MR branch, you can make local changes, commit them, and then create a new merge commit when ready to submit your changes back to the GitLab server as part of the merge request.'
    flag:
        branch: '[AI] `glab mr checkout --branch` is a GitLab command used to checkout a merge request (MR) branch locally, merging the MR changes into your current working directory. It fetches the latest MR branch and creates a new local branch based on it, then automatically merges that MR branch''s changes into your current branch or working directory, depending on your setup. This command is useful for reviewing and testing merge request changes before merging them into the main project branch.'
        set-upstream-to: |-
            [AI] The `glab` command with the given argument `mr checkout --set-upstream-to` is used in GitLab for merging and checking out branches.

            More specifically, it performs the following actions:

            1. Checks out a specific branch (specified after the command) into your local working directory.
            2. Sets the upstream branch (also specified as an argument) for that local branch in Git.

            This is useful when you want to update your local branch with changes from a remote branch before merging them, ensuring both branches have the most recent updates.
        track: '[AI] The `glab mr checkout --track` command is a Git operation using the Glab (Git Lab) tool. It checks out a merge request (MR) branch associated with a specific MR, merging the changes from the MR into the current branch and keeping track of the upstream MR. This command sets the local branch to match the head of the remote tracking branch for the given MR, allowing you to work on the latest changes and easily push updates back to GitLab when ready.'
