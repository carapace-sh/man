description: Remove file or directory at path
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `charm fs rm` command is used in Charmed Kubernetes (Juju) to delete files or directories from a contained Kubernetes file system volume. This command sends a request to the Charm Hub API to remove the specified file or directory from the container''s filesystem, triggering an action in the associated Kubernetes application charm. It does not directly interact with the Kubernetes cluster, but rather relies on the charm and its handlers to carry out the file system modification.'
