documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh search` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to query GitHub for repositories, issues, or users based on given keywords. It allows users to filter results by language, stars, forks, and other criteria. The basic syntax is `gh search <type> <query>`, where `<type>` refers to the item being searched (repo, user, issue) and `<query>` are the search terms. For instance, `gh search repo rust` will return repositories with the word "rust" in their names or descriptions.'
