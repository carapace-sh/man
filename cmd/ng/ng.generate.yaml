documentation:
    command: '[AI] `ng generate` is a command used in Angular applications to create new components, services, modules or other types of files based on predefined templates. It is part of Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) and simplifies the process of adding new functionality to an existing Angular project. The command takes as an argument the desired type and name of the file to be generated. For example, `ng generate component myComponentName`.'
    flag:
        defaults: '[AI] `ng generate --defaults` is a command used in Angular CLI (Angular Command Line Interface) for generating new Angular applications or components with default settings. The command does not create any files itself but instead sets up the default configurations for the next generation command. This can be useful when you want to create multiple similar components or applications with the same configuration, saving time and effort by avoiding manual setting of options each time.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `ng generate --dry-run` is a command used in Angular CLI to generate new components, services, or other types of files without actually creating them on disk. It performs a simulation of the generation process and displays what would be created if the command was run with `--no-git` flag set to avoid committing the changes to the Git repository. This can help in understanding the impact of the proposed change before executing it in a production environment.'
        force: '[AI] `ng generate --force` is a command used in Angular CLI (Angular Command Line Interface). This command is used to override the default Angular CLI guard that prevents the generation of files if they would overwrite existing ones. By using the `--force` flag, the user confirms that they intend to generate new files even if they will overwrite existing ones. It is important to use this flag with caution as it can lead to unintended file modifications or loss of data.'
        interactive: '[AI] `ng generate --interactive` is a command used in Angular CLI (Angular Command Line Interface). It generates new Angular components, services, or other artifacts based on a selected template. The "--interactive" flag enables an interactive mode where the CLI prompts the user for input instead of generating files automatically using previously configured defaults. This allows users to customize the output according to their specific requirements.'
