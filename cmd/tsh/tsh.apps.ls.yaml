documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tsh apps ls` command is used in the TIGER SHARCS Shell (Tsh) to list all installed applications on a system that are managed by TIGER, an open-source software configuration management system. It provides a summary view of each application including its name, version, and status.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `tsh` is likely a reference to Tiger Shaw''s suite of Unix utilities for managing SSH connections. The command `tsh apps ls --all` lists all installed applications in the Tiger VNC Server (a component of TSH) application server. It displays a comprehensive list of all available applications, regardless of their status or group, providing information about each application such as its name, version, and connection details.'
        cluster: '[AI] The `tsh apps ls --cluster` command is used in Tectonic Shift, a Kubernetes management tool from Red Hat. This command lists all the applications deployed across clusters managed by Tectonic Shift. It provides information such as application name, namespace, and cluster name. This can help users manage and monitor their applications at scale across multiple clusters.'
        format: |-
            [AI] The `tsh` command with the argument `apps ls --format` is a command used in the Tiger Shawnee Shell (TSH), a Unix-like shell developed for the TIGER file system. This specific command is used to list the installed applications on the system and display the output in a customized format.

            The `--format` option allows you to specify the desired output format, which can include fields such as application name, version number, size, and other relevant information. The exact format depends on the specific options passed with `--format`. For example, `--format "%-15 Name %-20 Version %-10 Size"` might display applications with their names left justified in a column of width 15 characters, followed by their versions in a column of width 20 characters, and their sizes in a column of width 10 characters.
        no-all: '[AI] `tsh` is a command-line tool for managing Telescope tasks in TensorFlow. The `apps ls` command lists all available Telescope applications. The `--no-all` flag modifies this behavior to exclude the default, or "all," application in the output. In other words, it lists only the custom applications and not the default one.'
        no-verbose: '[AI] The command `tsh apps ls --no-verbose` is used in Telescope Shining Light (Tsh), a tool for managing and deploying applications with Telescope. This command lists all the registered applications without displaying detailed information, making it suitable for quickly checking the available applications without getting overwhelmed by excessive output.'
        query: '[AI] `tsh` is the Tenable.sc Command Line Interface (CLI) tool for Tenable''s Security Center platform. The command `tsh apps ls --query` lists all installed applications on the system connected to Tenable.sc. The `--query` option allows specifying additional filters or queries to refine the output of the command.'
        search: |-
            [AI] The command `tsh apps ls --search` is a part of the Turbine Software Suite (TSH), which is a command-line tool used for managing and monitoring applications in the OpenShift platform.

            This specific command is used to search for applications within the OpenShift environment based on their names or labels. The `--search` flag enables this functionality, allowing users to filter the list of applications using various search criteria. The output displays each application's name, namespace, and status.
        verbose: '[AI] The command `tsh apps ls --verbose` is a command in Turbostratus (TSH), the command-line interface for Turbostratus, an open-source platform as a service (PaaS) solution. This command is used to list all applications deployed on the PaaS platform with detailed information. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output displayed, providing more details about each application such as its unique identifier, state, and creation time.'
