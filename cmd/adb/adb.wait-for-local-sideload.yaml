documentation:
    command: '[AI] `adb wait-for-local-sideload` is a command used with Android Debug Bridge (ADB), which initiates a wait loop for device-side notifications of successful local sideloading (installation of apps from the local system via USB). The command suspends further ADB commands'' execution, allowing you to use it before running `adb install` or similar commands to ensure that the device is ready to receive and acknowledge the installation package. Once the installation is complete, you can resume other ADB tasks.'
