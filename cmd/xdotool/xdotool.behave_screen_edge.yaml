name: behave_screen_edge
description: Bind an action to events when the mouse hits the screen edge or corner
flags:
    --delay=: Delay in milliseconds before running the command
    --quiesce=: Delay in milliseconds before the next command will run
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `xdotool` command with the argument `behave_screen_edge` is used to simulate user actions related to moving a window to an edge of the screen in X Window System environments. It does not move or modify the window directly, but rather sends signals to the window manager to perform the desired edge behavior. For example, it can be used to maximize a window when moved to the top edge of the screen or move it to a different workspace when moved to an edge with the appropriate workspace key bound.'
    flag:
        delay: '[AI] `xdotool behave_screen_edge` is a command-line tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical environment using the xdotool library. The specific option `--delay` sets a delay between individual actions, in milliseconds. For instance, `behave_screen_edge --delay 100` would introduce a 100ms delay between each edge behavior action executed by xdotool (such as moving the mouse pointer to an edge of the screen or simulating a key event). This can be useful when automating certain tasks to add a pause or synchronize actions with other processes.'
        quiesce: '[AI] `xdotool behave_screen_edge` is a command-line tool in the xdotool utility used for automating and interacting with the X Window System graphical environment. The specific command `behave_screen_edge --quiesce` instructs xdotool to put the system in a quiescent state, meaning it will pause or halt any ongoing interactions or scripts, focusing only on processing edge behaviors at screen edges without generating any additional events or output.'
