documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `dart create` command is used to create a new Dart project with a pre-configured directory structure and basic files, such as `pubspec.yaml`, `main.dart`, and `test_main.dart`. It sets up the project with necessary dependencies for a new Dart application using the Dart SDK or pub package manager. The command takes an argument, which is the name of the new project. For example: `dart create my_project`.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `dart create --force` is a command used in Dart programming language to create a new Dart project with the given name, skipping any prompts for user input. The `--force` option is used when you want to overwrite an existing project with the same name without being asked for confirmation. This can be useful when automating the creation of projects or when you''re sure you want to override an existing one.'
        help: '[AI] `dart create --help` is a command used in Dart programming language to generate a new Dart project with preconfigured templates and packages. The `--help` option displays detailed information about the available options and their usage for creating a new project. It allows users to specify various project parameters such as the application type (e.g., web, library), package name, and other project settings. Using this command helps users quickly set up a new Dart project with the desired configuration.'
        no-pub: '[AI] The `dart create` command with the `--no-pub` flag is used to create a new Dart project without initializing the `pubspec.yaml` file and the associated local package dependency cache. This means that the project will not have any preconfigured packages installed, allowing for a clean starting point when setting up the project manually.'
        pub: '[AI] The `dart create --pub` command is a Dart script used to create a new Dart project using the Dart publisher (Pub) for package management. It sets up a basic project structure, initializes a `pubspec.yaml` file with essential metadata and dependencies, and configures the project for publishing and using packages via the Pub system.'
        template: '[AI] `dart create` is a command-line tool provided by Dart, the programming language. The `--template` option is used to create a new Dart project using a predefined template. This can be useful for setting up common project structures and configurations quickly. For instance, you can use templates for creating a new Flutter application or a package for publishing on pub.dev. The specific template used is determined by the name provided after `--template`. For example, `dart create my_project --template=flutter` would create a new Flutter project.'
