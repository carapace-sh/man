description: Disable a workflow
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh workflow disable` is a GitHub CI/CD command used to turn off or deactivate an existing GitHub Actions workflow in a repository. This command disables the specified workflow file and stops any running jobs associated with it. It''s important to note that disabling a workflow does not delete the file, so you can enable it again if needed. Use this command followed by the path to your YAML workflow file (e.g., `gh workflow disable .github/workflows/your-workflow.yml`) in order to execute the disabling action.'
