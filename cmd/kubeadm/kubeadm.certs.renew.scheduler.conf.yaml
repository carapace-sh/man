description: Renew the certificate embedded in the kubeconfig file for the scheduler manager to use
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save the certificates
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubeconfig=: The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm certs renew` command is used to renew the TLS certification for the Kubernetes component named "scheduler" in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. The specific certification file being updated is located at `scheduler.conf`. This command helps maintain secure communication between components in your cluster and ensures that your scheduler continues to function properly without any certificate expiration issues.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew` is a command used to renew the TLS certificates for the Kubernetes cluster control plane components. The `--cert-dir` flag specifies the directory where the new certificates will be saved after they have been generated. The `scheduler scheduler.conf` part refers to the configuration file of the Kubernetes Scheduler component, which is responsible for managing and scheduling workloads in the cluster. This command is typically used when the existing certificates are about to expire or have already expired, in order to keep the cluster running with valid TLS certificates.'
        config: '[AI] The command `kubeadm certs renew scheduler scheduler.conf --config` is used to renew the TLS certificates for the Kubernetes Scheduler component in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. The `--config` flag specifies the configuration file for Kubeadm. The `renew` sub-command of the `kubeadm certs` tool is responsible for generating new certification authorities (CAs) and client and server certificates, replacing the old ones. By renewing the certificates for the Scheduler specifically with the `scheduler.conf` file argument, only its certificates will be updated.'
        kubeconfig: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew` is a command used to renew the TLS certificates for the Kubernetes control plane components such as the Kubernetes API server, etcd, and the Kubernetes scheduler. This command helps maintain a secure environment by keeping the certificates up-to-date and avoiding expired certificates which could result in authentication failures or security vulnerabilities. The option `--kubeconfig` specifies the location of the kubeconfig file used to communicate with the Kubernetes cluster. In this case, `scheduler scheduler.conf` refers to the configuration file for the Kubernetes scheduler where the renewed certificates will be applied.'
