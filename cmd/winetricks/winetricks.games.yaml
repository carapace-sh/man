    command: '[AI] `winetricks games` is not a valid command in Windows or WINE (Wine Is Not an Emulator). Winetricks is a graphical user interface for configuring WINE, allowing easy installation of various DLLs, libraries, and other components needed to run specific applications on WINE. The term "games" likely refers to running games using WINE with the help of Winetricks. To use it, you need to have WINE installed, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing Winetricks executable (usually in the WINE prefix), and type `wine start winetricks`. Then, select the game you wish to install, configure any necessary settings, and click "Apply" for Winetricks to automatically install required components. After installation, use WINE to run the game as usual.'
