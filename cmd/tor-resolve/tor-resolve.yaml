name: tor-resolve
description: resolve a hostname to an IP address via tor
flags:
    "-4": Use the SOCKS4a protocol rather than the default SOCKS5 protocol
    "-5": Use the SOCKS5 protocol
    -p=: Override the default SOCKS port without setting the hostname
    -v: Display verbose output
    -x: Perform a reverse lookup
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tor-resolve` is a command-line tool used with The Onion Router (Tor) network to perform DNS lookups while respecting Tor anonymity. It''s designed to query the Tor DNS bridge servers, allowing users to resolve domain names over Tor without revealing their IP address. This can be useful for accessing hidden services or sites that use .onion addresses. The tool returns the corresponding onion address if available or an error message otherwise.'
    flag:
        "4": '[AI] The command `tor-resolve -4` is used with the Tor network browsing software to perform DNS resolution using the Tor network instead of the local or standard DNS server. The `-4` option specifically requests IPv4 addresses in the response. This can be useful for accessing hidden services on the Tor network which use IPv4 addresses. The Tor network provides anonymity and privacy by routing traffic through multiple relays, making it difficult to trace the origin or destination of the connection.'
        "5": '[AI] The `tor-resolve -5` command is used with the Tor network anonymity software to perform DNS lookups. The `-5` option specifies that five DNS resolution hops (also called "aspects") should be performed, meaning that the initial query is sent through five different Tor entry nodes before returning the final IP address result. This can add an extra layer of obfuscation and privacy to the lookup process, as each DNS hop will return a different IP address, making it harder for an outside observer to trace the origin of the request.'
        p: |-
            [AI] `tor-resolve -p` is a command used with the Tor network's `tor` or `torresolve` tool. This option specifically performs a DNS lookup of a given hostname using the Tor network for increased privacy and anonymity.

            When you provide a target hostname as an argument, `tor-resolve -p` will query the Tor network's distributed DNS servers to resolve the IP address. This process helps protect your identity by routing the DNS request through the Tor network, making it harder for third parties to track the origin of the request and the IP address being resolved.

            So, `tor-resolve -p` is a privacy-focused command that uses the Tor network to perform DNS lookups, ensuring anonymity by routing the query through the Tor network instead of using traditional public DNS servers.
        v: '[AI] `tor-resolve` is a command-line tool for resolving domain names using the Tor network. The `-v` flag enables verbose output, providing detailed information about the DNS query process. This includes the IP addresses of the Tor entry and exit nodes used, timestamps, and any error messages if an issue occurs during resolution.'
        x: '[AI] `tor-resolve -x` is a command used with the Tor network software to perform reverse DNS lookups on IP addresses. The `-x` option instructs Tor''s built-in DNS resolver to perform a reverse lookup instead of a standard forward lookup. This can be useful for various purposes, such as determining the hostname associated with an IP address that belongs to the Tor network. Note that Tor is designed to ensure user privacy and anonymity, so using such commands should be done responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws and ethics.'
