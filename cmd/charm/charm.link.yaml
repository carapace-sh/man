documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `charms` command with the `link` subcommand is used in Juju, a service orchestration tool. This command links two charms together, meaning that it establishes a relationship between them. When one charm is linked to another, events or data can be passed between them, enabling complex application deployments and interaction between different services.'
