        [AI] `git stash` is a Git command used to save changes in a Git repository that are not yet ready to be committed. It allows you to keep your working directory clean while preserving the changes. The command `git stash` creates a new stash entry and applies any local modifications and the whole current index state to it. You can later apply or delete this stash using other Git commands such as `git stash apply` or `git stash drop`.

        Here are some key points:

        - Saves changes that aren't ready for committing
        - Allows you to keep a clean working directory
        - Creates a new stash entry with your modifications and index state
        - Can be applied or deleted later using other Git commands.
