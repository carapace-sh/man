        [AI] `nmcli` is a NetworkManager command-line utility for managing and monitoring network connections. The `connection add` command is used to create a new network connection profile.

        The basic syntax is: `nmcli connection add <connection-type> <connection-name> ifname <interface-name> [-- type <connection-technology>] [-- ip4 <address/prefix>] [-- ip6 <address/prefix>] [-- gateway <gateway-address>] [-- dns <dns-servers>] [-- username <username>] [-- password <password>]`

        Where:
        - `<connection-type>` is the connection type, such as 'wifi', 'ethernet', or 'vpn'.
        - `<connection-name>` is a descriptive name for the connection.
        - `<interface-name>` is the name of the network interface to which this connection will be applied.
        - Optional parameters include:
          - `-- type <connection-technology>` sets the specific connection technology, if needed. For example, for a wifi connection you might use 'wpa-psk'.
          - `-- ip4 <address/prefix>` sets the IPv4 address and prefix length for the connection.
          - `-- ip6 <address/prefix>` sets the IPv6 address and prefix length for the connection.
          - `-- gateway <gateway-address>` sets the default gateway address for the connection.
          - `-- dns <dns-servers>` sets the DNS servers to be used by the connection.
          - `-- username <username>` and `-- password <password>` are required for some types of connections, like VPNs.

        This command adds a new network connection configuration to the NetworkManager database. It doesn't actually activate the connection unless you use the 'connection up' command afterwards.
