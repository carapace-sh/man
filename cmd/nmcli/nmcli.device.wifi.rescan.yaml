description: Request that NetworkManager immediately re-scan for available access points
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nmcli` (NetworkManager Command-Line Interface) `device wifi rescan` command is used to initiate a new scan for available Wi-Fi networks in your system. This scan will update the list of nearby Wi-Fi networks, which can be useful when you need to connect to a hidden or newly appeared network, or if the current list needs an update. It doesn''t directly establish a connection with any network but rather provides up-to-date information about available Wi-Fi networks for further connection actions.'
