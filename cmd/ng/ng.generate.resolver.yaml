    --project=: The name of the project.
    --skip-tests: Do not create "spec.ts" test files for the new resolver.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `ng generate resolver` command in Angular is used to create a new Resolver service. Resolvers are responsible for fetching data prior to a Component or Directive being rendered, making the application more efficient by reducing the number of HTTP requests required. When you run this command with `ng g resolver <resolverName>`, Angular will generate a new file `<resolverName>.resolver.ts` in the `app/src/app/<folder>/resolvers/` directory, containing the basic structure for a Resolver service.'
    flag:
        flat: '[AI] `ng generate resolver --flat` is a command used in Angular to generate a new Resolver with a flat configuration. A Resolver is a service that handles data fetching and caching for Angular components or routes. By using the `--flat` option, the generated Resolver will not create a separate component or container for the resolved data, but instead return the data directly. This can be useful when working with simple data structures or when integrating with external APIs.'
        project: '[AI] `ng generate resolver` is a command used in Angular, a JavaScript framework for building web applications, to create a new Angular Resolver. A Resolver is a service that prepares routed components with data before the component is displayed. The `--project` flag is used to specify the name of the existing Angular project where you want to generate and add the new resolver. This allows you to maintain separate codebases for different projects if you''re working on multiple projects within the Angular CLI environment.'
        skip-tests: '[AI] `ng generate resolver --skip-tests` is a command used in Angular for generating a new Angular Resolver with the `--skip-tests` flag disabled the code scaffolding and unit test file generation for the new component. This means that the new resolver will be created without any associated test files, allowing you to write and set up your tests later manually if desired.'
