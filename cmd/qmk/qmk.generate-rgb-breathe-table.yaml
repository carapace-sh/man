    command: '[AI] The `qmk generate-rgb-breathe-table` command is a utility in the Quantum Mechanical Keyboard (QMK) firmware used to generate an RGB breathing table. This table defines a set of color transitions for use in RGB lighting effects, such as breathing or wave patterns, within QMK-compatible keyboards. By running this command, users can create customized breathing animations with various color schemes and intensities. The output is typically saved as a C file which can be easily included into the user''s QMK firmware project.'
    flag:
        center: '[AI] The `qmk generate-rgb-breathe-table --center` command is used in the Quantum Mechanical Keyboard (QMK) firmware to generate an RGB breathing table with a center-aligned effect. This means that the lit pixels will be arranged around a central point, creating a circular or radial breathing pattern on the keyboard. The table generated by this command can then be used to configure the RGB lighting effects in the QMK firmware for specific keyboards or keymaps.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `qmk generate-rgb-breathe-table` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project to generate an RGB breathing table. This table specifies how each RGB LED on a keyboard controlled by QMK should be lit during a breathing effect, which makes the LEDs fade in and out in different colors. The `--help` option is used to display detailed information about how to use this command, including any required arguments or options, and examples of usage. Here's an explanation of the help output:

            ```sh
            usage: qmk generate-rgb-breathe-table [-h] [--colors COLORS] [--delay DELAY] [--speed SPEED] [--fade-method FADING_METHOD]
                                                 [--step STEP] [--steps NUM_STEPS] [--transition TRANSITION]
                                                 [outfile OUTFILE]

            options:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              --colors COLORS       Comma-separated list of hex color codes (default: RGB, GREEN, BLUE)
              --delay DELAY         Delay between each step in milliseconds (default: 50)
              --speed SPEED          Speed of the breathing effect in milliseconds (default: 200)
              --fade-method FADING_METHOD, --ffm FADING_METHOD
                                   Choose the fade method: Linear (linear), Exponential (exp), Logarithmic (log)
                                       (default: Linear)
              --step STEP           Step size for each color in the breathing effect (default: 32)
              --steps NUM_STEPS     Number of steps in each color transition (default: 8)
              --transition TRANSITION, --tt TRANSITION
                                   Choose the color transition method: No transition (none), Fade (fade), Pulse (pulse)
                                       (default: Fade)
              outfile OUTFILE       Output file name (default: rgb_breathe.c)
            ```

            The command generates an RGB breathing table based on the provided options, creating a C code file that can be used to control the breathing effect in QMK keyboards. Users can customize the colors, delay, speed, fade method, step size, number of steps, and color transition method by specifying their desired values as command-line arguments or using default settings.
        max: '[AI] The `qmk generate-rgb-breathe-table --max` command is a part of the Quantum Mechanical Keyboard (QMK) firmware. It generates an RGB breathing table with the maximum brightness level for each RGB LED color. The command creates a JSON file that defines the gradual color transitions between different colors during the breathing effect, where each color reaches its maximum brightness level at the respective stage of the animation cycle.'
        output: '[AI] The `qmk generate-rgb-breathe-table --output` command is used in the Quantum Mechanical Keyboard (QMK) firmware to generate an RGB breathing table. This table defines color transitions for RGB LEDs that breathe or cycle through different colors in a wave-like pattern. The `--output` option specifies where the generated table should be saved, usually as a separate file that can be included in QMK configuration files for customizing RGB lighting effects on keyboards.'
        quiet: '[AI] The command `qmk generate-rgb-breathe-table --quiet` is used in the QMK firmware programming environment to generate an RGB breathing table for keyboards. The `--quiet` flag is used to suppress any output or messages during the process, making it run in the background without interfering with other console activities. The generated table defines various color transitions and intensities for RGB LEDs to create a "breathing" effect.'
