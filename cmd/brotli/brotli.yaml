documentation:
    command: '[AI] Brotli is a modern lossless compression algorithm for compressing data on the web, particularly suitable for use with HTTP headers and trailers. It provides better compression than gzip or deflate while requiring only a small increase in computation time. The term "brotli" comes from the interjection "br" meaning "bross" (a brother or a cool guy) and the suffix "-tli" inspired by "gzip" and "zlib". It''s implemented as a library or tool for compressing and decompressing data, often used to serve compressed web content.'
    flag:
        "0": '[AI] `brotli -0` is a command-line option for the Brotli compression utility. The `-0` flag instructs Brotli to operate in maximum compatibility mode, producing output that conforms to the oldest possible versions of Brotli. This mode is useful when dealing with older systems or applications that may not support all the latest features of Brotli. The main goal is to ensure broadest compatibility while compressing or decompressing files.'
        "1": '[AI] The `brotli -1` command is used to compress files using the Brotli compression algorithm, with compression level set to the fastest and most compressive mode (level 1). Brotli is a lossless data compression algorithm that is particularly effective on text-heavy content and is often used for web content due to its good compression ratio and fast decoding speed. The resulting compressed file will have a `.br` extension.'
        "2": |-
            [AI] The `brotli -2` is a command-line option for Brotli, a lossless data compression algorithm and format. A Brotli compressed file is identified with the extension `.br`.

            The `-2` flag is used to specify the compression level: it indicates a medium compression level. This means that the compressed file will have a balance between compression ratio and decompression speed, which makes it a good choice for use cases where both efficiency and performance are important, such as web content delivery.
        "3": '[AI] The `brotli -3` command is related to Brotli, a lossless data compression algorithm and format. The number `-3` is an option for the Brotli compression utility, indicating the compression level. Level 3 is a medium compression setting that provides a good balance between compression ratio and decompression speed. The goal of using this command would be to compress a file using the Brotli algorithm with a moderate level of compression.'
        "4": '[AI] The `brotli -4` command is related to Brotli, a lossless data compression algorithm. The number `-4` is an option indicating the compression level. Specifically, it sets the compression level to "force maximum compression", which may result in larger compressed files but with better compression ratio compared to other levels.'
        "5": '[AI] The command `brotli -5` is used to compress files using the Brotli compression algorithm with a compression level of 5. Brotli is a lossless compression algorithm known for its fast compression and decompression speed, especially suitable for streaming applications. The number 5 is an optional parameter specifying the desired compression level where higher numbers result in more aggressive compression at the cost of longer compression times.'
        "6": '[AI] The term "brotli -6" refers to a specific compression level when using the Brotli data compression algorithm. The number "-6" signifies the highest compression level, meaning that the algorithm will prioritize achieving the smallest possible output size. This flag is often used in command-line contexts when compressing or decompressing files with tools such as `brotlicompress` or `brotlidecompress`.'
        "7": '[AI] The `brotli -7` command is related to Brotli, a lossless compression algorithm. The number `-7` is a compression level option for Brotli. A lower value like `-7` indicates a higher compression ratio but longer compression time and potentially larger decoding time. This level is considered a good balance between compression speed and size for most use cases.'
        "8": '[AI] The term "brotli -8" refers to using the Brotli compression level 8 when compressing data with the Brotli compression algorithm. This means applying a higher degree of compression, which can result in smaller file sizes but may take longer to compress and decompress compared to lower compression levels.'
        "9": '[AI] `brotli -9` is a command-line option for Brotli, a lossless compression algorithm. The `-9` flag sets the highest compression level (maximum compression), resulting in smaller output sizes but longer compression times. Other levels (0 to 8) provide a tradeoff between compression ratio and speed.'
        best: '[AI] The `brotli --best` command is used with Brotli, a lossless data compression algorithm. The `--best` option is a compression level setting, which requests that the Brotli compressor use the highest possible compression level while still maintaining its lossless property. In other words, this option will result in the smallest output file size achievable by the compressor for the given input data.'
        decompress: '[AI] `brotli --decompress` is a command used in data compression utilities, specifically with Brotli, a lossless and efficient compression algorithm. This command decompresses previously compressed Brotli data, expanding it back to its original size and format. The input for this command would be a compressed Brotli file, and the output will be the decompressed data. It''s often used when working with websites or applications that compress their content using Brotli for faster transmission over the internet.'
        force: '[AI] `--force` is a command-line option used with the Brotli data compression algorithm. When this flag is passed to Brotli compression tools, it overwrites existing output files without asking for confirmation. This can be useful in automation workflows or scripts where you want to ensure that the output files are always replaced with the most recent compressed data. However, be aware that using `--force` can overwrite important files without warning, so use it with caution.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `brotli` is a lossless compression algorithm and library. The `--help` option when used with the `brotli` command-line tool displays detailed help information. Here's a brief summary:

            - `--compress` or `-c`: Compress input data using Brotli compression.
            - `--decompress` or `-d`: Decompress Brotli-compressed data.
            - `--input` or `-i`: Path to the input file.
            - `--output` or `-o`: Path to output file (for compress).
            - `--mode`: Set mode to either "filter" (default), "stream", or "lzfse".
            - `--quality`: Control compression level (higher values result in smaller output size but longer compression time).
            - `--max_mem`: Limit the maximum memory usage for compression.
            - `--threads`: Number of threads to use for parallel processing.
            - Various other options for advanced usage like setting headers, testing compression levels, and more.
        keep: '[AI] The `--keep` option in the Brotli compression utility is used to specify file retention behavior after compression or decompression. With this option, the original input files are preserved and will not be deleted by default after successful compression or decomposition. In other words, it maintains the source files alongside the compressed output files. This can be useful for ensuring that the original data remains accessible after compressing or decompressing with Brotli.'
        large_window: '[AI] The `--large_window` flag is a command-line option for the data compression algorithm, Brotli. It enables larger compression windows in Brotli, allowing it to process larger inputs more efficiently and potentially achieving better compression ratios. A larger window size allows Brotli to consider longer contexts while compressing data, resulting in more optimal compressions for large files or streams.'
        lgwin: '[AI] The `--lgwin` option in Brotli is a compression level setting for Brotli, a lossless data compression algorithm. It stands for "Large Window" and it increases the size of the compression window, allowing Brotli to process larger input data more efficiently and potentially achieve better compression ratios. However, larger windows also require more memory and processing power, so using `--lgwin` may increase the resource requirements for compression and decompression.'
        no-copy-stat: '[AI] The `--no-copy-stat` flag is used with Brotli, a lossless compression algorithm. It disables the copying of file modification times and permissions during data compression. This means that the compressed output will have its own modification time and permissions, rather than inheriting them from the input files. This can be useful in certain use cases, such as when generating compressed data without altering original files, or for consistency across different platforms.'
        output: '[AI] The `--output` flag in Brotli is used to specify the output file name when compressing or decompressing data using this compression algorithm. This flag helps users to easily direct the compressed (or decompressed) data into a specific file instead of printing it to the standard output stream.'
        quality: '[AI] The `--quality` option in Brotli is used to set the compression level for the Brotli compression algorithm. Higher values indicate a more aggressive compression, resulting in smaller file sizes but with longer compression times and potentially higher CPU usage. Conversely, lower values prioritize faster compression times and lower CPU usage at the cost of larger output sizes. The default value is often set to provide a good balance between compression size and speed.'
        rm: '[AI] The `--rm` flag used with the `brotli` compression tool is an option that tells the command to automatically remove source files after they have been successfully compressed. In other words, this flag enables the deletion of input files once the Brotli compression process is finished, saving disk space and reducing clutter.'
        stdout: '[AI] The `brotli --stdout` command is used with Brotli, a lossless compression algorithm. This specific command line option instructs Brotli to compress data and output the result directly to stdout (standard output stream) without writing it to a file. In other words, it performs live compression of input data on the console.'
        suffix: '[AI] The `--suffix` option in Brotli compression is used to specify a custom extension for output files. By default, Brotli compresses files with no file extension or appends `.br` as the suffix. However, using `--suffix` allows you to set another desired extension, such as `.boo` or `.gz`, for example, when compressing and saving the output file.'
        test: '[AI] `brotli --test` is a command used in Brotli, a lossless compression algorithm and format. This specific command is not for compressing or decompressing files but instead is used to perform various tests on the Brotli library itself. These tests check different aspects of Brotli''s functionality, such as compression and decompression speed, memory usage, and compatibility with different input data. The results provide valuable insights into Brotli''s performance and help identify potential issues or improvements.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brotli --verbose` is a command-line option used with Brotli, a lossless data compression library. When this option is passed during compression or decompression of files, it enables verbose output, which means more detailed information about the process will be displayed on the console. This can include things like progress updates, compression ratios, and other debugging information that may be useful for troubleshooting and understanding how Brotli is handling specific data.'
        version: '[AI] `brotli --version` is a command used in Terminal or Command Prompt to check the version information of the Brotli data compression algorithm installed on your system. When executed, it prints out the Brotli library''s version number, including major and minor releases as well as any additional build metadata if available.'
