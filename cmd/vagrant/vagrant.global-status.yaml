    command: '[AI] The `vagrant global-status` command is used to display the list of installed Vagrant boxes, along with their versions and locations, on a global level across all projects in your system. It allows you to quickly check which boxes are available for use in Vagrant without having to access individual project directories.'

            [AI] The `vagrant global-status --prune` command is used to list all the installed Vagrant boxes and remove any unused or invalid ones. Here's a brief explanation of its functionality:

            1. `global-status`: This option displays the list of all installed Vagrant boxes globally (across multiple projects) along with their versions and locations.
            2. `--prune`: This option automatically removes any unused or invalid boxes, meaning those that are not associated with any project and have no known valid URLs. It helps to keep your local Vagrant environment clean by removing unnecessary boxes and reducing potential confusion or errors due to incorrect versions.
