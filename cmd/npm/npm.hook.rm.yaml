    command: '[AI] The `npm` `hook rm` command is a custom script registered under the `rm` event in an `npm` package''s `package.json` file. When this event is triggered, usually by deleting or unlinking a file or directory within the project, the hook script is executed. The content of the script is defined by the package developer and can include tasks such as logging, running other scripts, or performing data validation before the deleted files are permanently removed.'
