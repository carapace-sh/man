    command: '[AI] `flatpak enter` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager for Linux systems. It allows users to gain a shell within the container environment of a specific Flatpak application or runtime. This command grants temporary access to the filesystem and other system resources inside the container, enabling users to perform troubleshooting, debugging, or other tasks that may require direct interaction with the contained application or its dependencies.'

        help: |-
            [AI] `flatpak enter` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The `--help` option is used to display detailed help information about this specific command.

            When you run `flatpak enter --help`, it will output a brief description of the `enter` command followed by a list of options and their corresponding arguments. Here's an overview:

            - Description: Allows entering a Flatpak container or application as the current working directory.
            - Options:
              - `--no-chroot`: Runs the entered application without starting a new root filesystem (chroot).
              - `--filesystem=<path>`: Mounts a specific host filesystem path within the container.
              - `--commit=<branch|tag|hash>`: Enters an interactive shell in a specific commit of the Flatpak application's source tree.
            - Examples: To enter a Flatpak application named "MyApp" and start a bash shell, use: `flatpak enter MyApp`. To enter the same application and mount a host directory at /mnt/data, use: `flatpak enter --filesystem=/mnt/data MyApp`.
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak enter` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to open an isolated container for debugging or making modifications. The `--ostree-verbose` option is used to increase the verbosity of output when working with OSTree, which is the version control system used by Flatpak to manage filesystem snapshots. This option will display detailed information about each transaction and commit during the container entry, helping developers understand the state changes in real time.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak enter` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment platform. The `--verbose` option is used to increase the amount of output produced by the command. When you run `flatpak enter --verbose`, it opens an interactive shell inside a specific container (application or runtime). This shell session provides access to the files and environment of the application for debugging or other purposes. The verbose flag increases the level of detail in the output, providing more information about what Flatpak is doing as it sets up the container environment for you.'
