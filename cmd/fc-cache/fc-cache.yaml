    command: '[AI] `fc-cache` is a command in Linux systems used to update or clear the File Command cache. This cache stores information about the color capabilities of terminal devices and graphics files, allowing applications like SSH and X Window System to display colors correctly. Running `fc-cache -f` will force rebuild the cache while `fc-cache -v` displays verbose output during the process.'
    flag:
        error-on-no-fonts: |-
            [AI] The `fc-cache --error-on-no-fonts` command is a utility in the Fontconfig system used to manage font files and make them available for applications. This specific command is used to clear the Fontconfig cache if it encounters missing font files, instead of silently ignoring them as the default behavior might do.

            The `--error-on-no-fonts` option causes Fontconfig to raise an error when it can't locate any fonts for a given query, forcing the user to address the issue and either install or make available the required font files before continuing with other operations that rely on accurate font rendering.
        force: '[AI] The `fc-cache --force` command is used in the File System in Userspace (FHS) cache management system of Fedora and Red Hat Linux distributions. It forces the FSFCache daemon to revalidate and update its mDNS multicast DNS and DHCP snooping caches. This ensures that recently added or modified DNS records and DHCP leases are picked up by the system, allowing applications like `nautilus` and `gvfs` to correctly display networked files and directories in file managers.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `fc-cache` is a command-line utility in the `glibc` library of the Fedora and Red Hat Linux distributions for managing and updating the File Change Notifier (FAM) cache. The `--help` option provides detailed usage information about this command.

            When run with `--help`, the output displays various options that can be used with `fc-cache`. These include:

            * `--force` or `-f`: Recaches all files and directories in the FAM cache, ignoring any existing stale data.
            * `--verbose` or `-v`: Displays detailed information about the caching process, including which files are being cached.
            * `--help`: Display this help message and exit.
            * `--version`: Print the version number of the `fc-cache` utility and exit.

            Additionally, you can specify a directory or file to cache using the argument to the command (e.g., `fc-cache /path/to/directory`). Without any arguments, it will cache all files and directories in the system's FAM cache.
        really-force: |-
            [AI] The `fc-cache --really-force` command is a utility in the File System in Userspace (FHS) cache manager for the glibc library, which is used to speed up file system access by caching frequently accessed files and their metadata.

            When using this command with the `--really-force` option, it forces the FHS cache to clear all its cached data and rebuild it from scratch. This action can be helpful in certain situations, such as after installing new fonts or when experiencing font rendering issues. By recaching all files, any changes made to the file system are reflected in applications that rely on the FHS cache.
        sysroot: '[AI] `fc-cache --sysroot` is a command used in Fedora-based Linux distributions to update the system-wide File Change Notifier (FCLN) cache, also known as the mime database or MIME type cache. The `--sysroot` option specifies that the cache should be updated for the entire system, rather than just the current user''s cache. This command ensures that applications can correctly identify file types based on their file extensions, and it''s often used when installing new software or after making changes to file associations.'
        system-only: '[AI] `fc-cache --system-only` is a command used in Fedora and Red Hat Linux distributions to update the system-wide file caching database of the `glibc` library''s `locale` data, which is managed by the `glibc-utils` package. This command updates only the system cache (as opposed to user caches), ensuring consistency across all users on a system. The "--system-only" option is used to avoid updating per-user caches.'
        verbose: '[AI] `fc-cache --verbose` is a command used in Fedora and Red Hat systems to update and manage the File System Hierarchy Cache (FHS cache or fcache). The `--verbose` option increases the output of the command, providing detailed information about the files being cached and the progress of the operation. The fc-cache tool helps optimize file access speed by storing metadata about files in a local cache, reducing the time required to locate files on the system.'
        version: '[AI] `fc-cache --version` is a command used in Fedora and Red Hat systems to manage the File Command (fc) cache, which is a part of the SELinux security suite. This command displays the version information of the current installed fc-cache package. It helps users check if they have the latest version of the software for potential bug fixes or new features.'
