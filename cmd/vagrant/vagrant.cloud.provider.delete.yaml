    command: |-
        [AI] The `vagrant cloud provider delete` command is used to remove a specific Vagrant cloud provider from your local Vagrant configuration. This command deletes any saved configurations associated with that provider in the `~/.vagrant.d/boxes` directory, allowing you to start fresh with a new installation or configuration of that provider.

        To use this command, first ensure you have no running Vagrant instances using that provider. Then run `vagrant cloud provider delete <provider-name>` in your terminal or command prompt, replacing `<provider-name>` with the name of the provider you wish to remove. For example, if you want to delete the VirtualBox provider, you would run:

        ```
        $ vagrant cloud provider delete virtualbox
        ```

        Confirm the deletion by providing your password or running the command with `--force` flag if you're sure you want to proceed without confirmation. Once executed, that provider will be deleted from your Vagrant configuration.
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud provider delete --force` command is used to permanently delete a specific Vagrant Cloud provider from your local configuration. The `--force` option is used to confirm and bypass any warnings or prompts that would prevent the deletion from occurring. After running this command, the specified provider will no longer be available for use when configuring new Vagrant projects.'
        no-force: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud provider delete` command with the `--no-force` option is used to delete a specific Vagrant Cloud (now named Atlas) box provider from your local Vagrant configuration. This means that you will remove the connection to the remote registry where you downloaded the boxes from. The `--no-force` flag prevents Vagrant from overwriting an existing provider with the same name, if one already exists in your config. It''s a safety measure to ensure accidental modification of your configuration.'
