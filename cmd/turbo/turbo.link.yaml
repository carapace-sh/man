    command: '[AI] The term "turbo link" is not a standard command or a feature in any specific technology or programming language. It seems to be a misspelled or incorrect usage of the term "TurboPages," which was a feature in older versions of Microsoft FrontPage web design software. TurboPages allowed for the creation of dynamically linked web pages, where changes made on one page would automatically update linked pages without requiring a full page reload. However, as of now, there is no such command as "turbo link" in any known technology or software context.'
