        [AI] The `npm dist-tag` is a command used in npm (Node Package Manager) to set or change a tag for a specific version of a package in the npm registry. Tags help organize packages and can be used to indicate different versions for different use cases, such as stable, beta, or prerelease. The basic syntax for using `npm dist-tag` is:

        ```bash
        npm dist-tag <add|rm> <@scope/name>@<version> <tag-name>
        ```

        Here's a breakdown of the command:

        * `<add|rm>`: This specifies whether you want to add or remove a tag.
        * `<@scope/name>`: This is the npm package name in the format `@scope/name`. For example, `@myorg/mypackage`.
        * `<version>`: This is the specific version number of the package that you want to tag.
        * `<tag-name>`: This is the name of the tag that you want to add or remove.

        For instance, to add a tag named "beta" for version 1.0.0 of the package "@myorg/mypackage", you would run:

        ```bash
        npm dist-tag add @myorg/mypackage@1.0.0 beta
        ```

        workspace: '[AI] The `npm dist-tag` command with the `--workspace` option is used to set or change distribution tags (also known as scopes) for packages within a monorepo or workspace in npm (Node Package Manager). This command allows you to manage multiple packages under one npm account, each with its distinct tag, simplifying versioning and publishing processes.'
        workspaces: '[AI] `npm dist-tag` is a command in Node Package Manager (npm) used to set or change the distribution tag of an npm package. The `--workspaces` option is related to npm workspaces, which allows managing multiple packages in a single Git repository. With `--workspaces`, the `dist-tag` command applies to all the packages within that workspace instead of just the active package directory. This way, you can easily manage and version tags across related projects consistently.'
