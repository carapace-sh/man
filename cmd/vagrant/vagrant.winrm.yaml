documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vagrant winrm` is a Vagrant command used to connect and execute commands on a remote Windows guest machine using WinRM (Windows Remote Management) technology. It allows you to interact with the guest operating system as if you were directly logged in, perform tasks such as running scripts, managing files, or executing PowerShell commands. This command assumes that WinRM is already installed and configured in your Vagrantfile or manually on the guest machine.'
    flag:
        command: '[AI] `vagrant winrm --command` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This specific command invokes WinRM (Windows Remote Management) to execute commands on a remote Vagrant machine over SSH or RDP connection. The `--command` option specifies the command to be executed on the remote machine. For example, `vagrant winrm --command "cmd /c ipconfig"` would display IP configuration information for the Windows-based Vagrant box.'
        elevated: |-
            [AI] `vagrant winrm --elevated` is a command used with Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. The `winrm` part refers to using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) as a provisioner to configure the guest OS after it's been booted up.

            The `--elevated` flag specifies that WinRM should run its commands with administrative privileges on the guest system, allowing actions that require elevated permissions. This is useful when configuring services or installing software that requires admin access.
        shell: '[AI] `vagrant winrm --shell` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for managing and creating local and remote virtual machines. This specific command establishes an SSH-like connection to a Windows guest machine using WinRM (Windows Remote Management) as the underlying transport protocol. The `--shell` option starts a command-line shell session on the remote machine after establishing the connection, allowing users to run commands directly on the remote system.'
