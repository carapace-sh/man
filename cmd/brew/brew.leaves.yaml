    command: '[AI] The `brew leaves` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command lists all the installed Homebrew formulae and their associated dependencies, but does not show outdated or removed packages. It provides a clear overview of currently active packages in your system.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `brew leaves --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command lists out the currently installed Homebrew formulas and casks (GUI applications) along with debug information. The debug information includes the installation path, version, and installation date for each formula or cask. This command can be helpful in troubleshooting issues related to Homebrew packages or for gaining more detailed information about the installed software.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `brew leaves --help` command is used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux. This specific command displays detailed help information about the `leaves` sub-command of Homebrew. The `leaves` command is used to manage installed formulas that have been deprecated or removed from Homebrew's tap (the central repository).

            The output of `brew leaves --help` will provide a brief description of the `leaves` command, followed by a list of available sub-commands and their functions. These sub-commands include: `list`, which lists the deprecated formulas installed on your system; `upgrade`, which upgrades the versions of deprecated formulas to their latest available version; and `remove`, which uninstalls the specified deprecated formula, along with its dependencies.

            Additionally, the help information will explain how to use each sub-command with specific options, if applicable. For instance, using `brew leaves list` without any additional flags will simply display a list of all installed deprecated formulas, while using it with an optional `--reinstalleable` flag will provide more detailed information about the installability state of each deprecated formula.
        installed-as-dependency: '[AI] `brew leave --installed-as-dependency` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. It lists the dependencies of an already installed package that were installed solely to satisfy dependencies of other packages, not the main package itself. These packages can be safely uninstalled without affecting the functioning of the primary package or the system.'
        installed-on-request: '[AI] The `brew leaves --installed-on-formula` command is a function in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. It lists out the installed Homebrew packages and their corresponding formulae (the instructions used to install them). The `--installed-on-request` modifier filters the output to only show the packages that were installed in response to a specific user request or installation command. In other words, it provides a record of which packages were explicitly requested to be installed.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `brew leave --quiet` command is a method used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to install or update software without displaying any verbose output or progress bars in the Terminal window. This can be useful when running multiple commands at once or when working in a script environment where you prefer a quiet operation.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew leave --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command removes (uninstalls) a previously installed Homebrew package or formula with more detailed output. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of information provided during the removal process. It displays each step taken and any relevant messages or warnings that occur throughout the uninstallation.'
