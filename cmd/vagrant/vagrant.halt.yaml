name: halt
description: stops the vagrant machine
flags:
    -f, --force: Force shut down (equivalent of pulling power)
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant halt` command is used to gracefully stop and shut down a running Vagrant virtual machine. It sends a SIGTERM signal to the guest OS, allowing it to perform an orderly shutdown. This ensures that any running processes are properly terminated and data is saved before the VM is completely powered off.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `vagrant halt --force` is a Vagrant command used to forcibly shut down a running virtual machine (VM) instance managed by Vagrant. The `--force` option is used when the VM refuses to be halted using the regular `vagrant halt` command due to unclean shutdown or other issues. This command sends a SIGTERM signal to the VM and, if it doesn''t respond within a certain timeframe, sends a SIGKILL signal to forcefully terminate the process and shut down the VM.'
