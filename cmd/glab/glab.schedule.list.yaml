    command: '[AI] The `glab schedule list` command is used in GitLab to display a list of scheduled jobs or cron jobs set up in your current project. It helps you manage and view the automated workflows configured for continuous integration, deployment, or other tasks that are scheduled to run at specific intervals. This command retrieves information about the scheduled jobs such as their names, next run time, and status.'
    flag:
        page: '[AI] `glab schedule list --page` is a GitLab CI/CD command used to retrieve a specific page of scheduled jobs'' information. The `glab` tool interacts with GitLab''s REST API, and this particular command fetches the list of scheduled jobs along with their details for a specified number of pages, with the `--page` flag specifying which page of results to return. For instance, using `--page 2` would fetch the second page of scheduled jobs. This information can be helpful in monitoring and managing GitLab pipelines at scale.'
        per-page: '[AI] `glab schedule list --per-page` is a GitLab CI/CD command used to retrieve a specified number of scheduled jobs or pipelines from a project. The `--per-page` option sets the maximum number of items to be displayed in one response page. By default, it shows 25 items per page; however, you can adjust this value using the `--per-page` argument to display more or fewer items as needed. This command helps users to manage and monitor their CI/CD jobs more efficiently by providing them with a customizable view of their scheduled tasks.'
