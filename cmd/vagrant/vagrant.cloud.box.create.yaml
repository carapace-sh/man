    command: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud box create` command is used to create a new virtual machine box definition in Hashicorp''s Vagrant Cloud registry. It does not create or provision an actual virtual machine, but instead generates a template with necessary configuration files and metadata that can be shared with others. This command is typically invoked when creating a new custom box image based on existing base images, by providing the name, URL to the base box, and any additional configurations as arguments.'
    flag:
        description: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud box create` command is used to create a new VirtualBox or other provider-specific Vagrant box on Vagrant Cloud (now called Atlantis). The `--description` option sets the description for the box when it''s pushed to Vagrant Cloud. It''s a way to provide information about the box, such as its purpose, version number, or any other relevant details.'
        no-private: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud box create` command is used to create a new Vagrant Box, which is a pre-configured virtual machine image that can be easily provisioned and managed with Vagrant. The `--no-private` option specifies that the box should be published to the public section of Vagrant Cloud, rather than being saved as a private box for local use only. This means that anyone with an Internet connection can access and use the box by searching for it in the Vagrant Cloud registry.'
        private: '[AI] `vagrant cloud box create --private` is a Vagrant command used to create a new private (or custom) box for use with Vagrant. This command takes various options to define the box details such as name, base image, and provisioning scripts. The `--private` flag indicates that the box will be stored in the user''s Vagrant Cloud account as a private box, which can only be accessed by the owner or those with explicit permission. Using this command helps to create customized environments for development and testing, making it easier to replicate consistent setups across different projects.'
