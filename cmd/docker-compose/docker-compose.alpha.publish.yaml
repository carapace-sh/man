    command: |-
        [AI] `docker-compose alpha publish` is a command used with Docker Compose files to build and publish Docker images for all services defined in the Compose file. This command uses the Docker Daemon to build the images based on their respective Dockerfiles, then pushes these images to a specified registry using authentication configured in `~/.docker/config.json` or by providing an access token as an argument.

        This command is considered "alpha" because it's part of the experimental features of Docker Compose, and its usage and behavior might change in future releases. To use it, make sure your Dockerfile paths are correctly defined in the Compose file, then run `docker-compose up --build --no-start` (or `publish`) to build and publish images for all services.
    flag:
        oci-version: '[AI] `docker-compose` is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The `alpha publish --oci-version` command is an experimental feature that builds and publishes a container image using the Open Container Initiative (OCI) format with the specified version. This command generates a manifest file describing the image, builds it using the local Dockerfile, and then pushes it to a registry using the authentication configuration in `$DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE`. The `--oci-version` flag sets the OCI image format version.'
        resolve-image-digests: '[AI] `docker-compose` is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The `alpha publish` command is an experimental feature introduced in Docker Compose v2. The `--resolve-image-digests` option instructs the command to build any images specified in the `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` file and generate the corresponding image digests before publishing them to a registry. In other words, it ensures that the latest versions of all images are used when publishing the application configuration.'
