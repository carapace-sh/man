    --no-descriptions: disable completion descriptions
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `toit lsp completion fish` command is used to enable Language Server Protocol (LSP) code completions for the Fish Shell. Toit is a Haskell-based text editor and IDE, and it includes an LSP server. The command instructs Toit to configure Fish Shell to utilize its LSP server for providing code completions as you type.'
    flag:
        no-descriptions: |-
            [AI] The command `toit lsp completion fish --no-descriptions` is related to the Toit programming language's Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration with the Fish Shell for autocompletion.

            The flag `--no-descriptions` instructs the Toit LSP server not to send description information during autocompletion requests, which can help reduce the amount of data transferred between the client and server, potentially improving performance. The flag can be useful in networked environments or when working with larger projects where bandwidth or processing power may be limited.
