    command: '[AI] The `tsh headless approve` command is used in TeamCity, a continuous integration and deployment tool by JetBrains. This command approves changes made to configuration files of a TeamCity agent running in headless mode. Headless mode means the agent is not interactively managed through the web UI but controlled via API or command-line interface. The `approve` action validates and applies the configuration changes.'

            [AI] `tsh` is a command-line tool for managing Terraform infrastructure, and the given command is using the Terraform State Handler (`tsh`) to perform an approval action on a particular change in the Terraform state.

            The command `tsh headless approve --no-skip-confirm` performs the following actions:

            1. `headless`: Runs the command in non-interactive mode, meaning no confirmation prompts will be shown and decisions will be made based on the provided configuration.
            2. `approve`: Approves the change in the Terraform state, allowing the change to be applied when you are using workspaces or parallel runs with `terraform apply`.
            3. `--no-skip-confirm`: Disables the automatic skipping of confirmation prompts for subsequent approvals. By default, `tsh` will skip the confirmation prompt if it has already approved a change for the same resource in the current workspace within the last 24 hours. With this flag, you are explicitly stating that you want to be prompted for approval every time.

            [AI] The `tsh` (Terraform State Helper) command `headless approve --skip-confirm` is used in Terraform workflows for reviewing and applying infrastructure changes. Here's a brief explanation of each part:

            1. `tsh`: Terraform State Helper is a tool that provides an interface to manage Terraform's state file, which tracks the current configuration and resources in your infrastructure.
            2. `headless`: This means running the command without a user interface (UI). It's useful when automating or scripting tasks.
            3. `approve`: This is an action that allows reviewers to approve changes before applying them to the infrastructure, which helps maintain control and ensures consistency in your deployment process.
            4. `--skip-confirm`: This flag skips the confirmation prompt when running the `approve` command. It allows you to automatically apply approved changes without additional user interaction, potentially making your workflows more efficient. Note that using this option should be done with caution, as it bypasses an essential safety mechanism in Terraform's approval process.
