description: Compute a hash of a local package archive
flags:
    -a, --algorithm=: The hash algorithm to use
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pip hash` command is not a valid command in PIP (Python Package Installer). PIP does not have a built-in `hash` sub-command. This command might be confused with other commands like `pip install <package> --no-cache-dir`, which installs a package without using the local cache, or `pip show <package> --files`, which displays the files of an installed package along with their checksums (hashes) for verification.'
    flag:
        algorithm: '[AI] The `pip hash` command is a utility provided by Pip, the Package Installer for Python. When used with the `--algorithm` option, it calculates and displays the hash value of a specific Python package using a selected hashing algorithm. This is primarily done to ensure data integrity and verify that the downloaded package matches its original source before installation. Commonly used algorithms include SHA1, SHA256, and MD5.'
