documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `deno types` command is a tool provided by Deno, a modern and secure TypeScript runtime. It''s used for type checking TypeScript files without running the code. This command reads the specified files or directories and provides type-checking errors and warnings based on the TypeScript compiler (TSC). If no errors are found, it indicates that the code is type-safe. The `deno types` command can be executed from the Deno CLI and is particularly useful during development for identifying and fixing type issues in your codebase.'
