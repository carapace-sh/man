documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `bc` command is a powerful calculator and scripting language available in Unix-like operating systems. It provides arbitrary precision decimal arithmetic, supports user-defined functions and variables, and can handle input from a file or interactive user sessions. It''s particularly useful for performing complex mathematical calculations, especially those involving large numbers, and is often used in shell scripts for this purpose.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `bc` is a popular command-line calculator and programming language for mathematical and scientific computations. The option `--help` when used with `bc` displays detailed information about the available commands, built-in functions, and other features of the `bc` language. This help output is designed to assist users in effectively using the tool for their specific needs.'
        interactive: '[AI] `bc` is a command-line calculator and scripting language for mathematical and scientific computations. The option `--interactive` enables interactive mode when running the `bc` command. In this mode, `bc` accepts user input through the standard input stream (keyboard), processes it as expressions or statements, displays the results, and waits for the next input. This makes it suitable for performing calculations interactively and experimentally at the terminal.'
        mathlib: '[AI] The `bc` command is a popular calculator program for Unix-like operating systems. The option `--mathlib` is used to specify a library file containing additional mathematical functions and libraries for `bc`. This option allows users to extend the capabilities of `bc` by providing access to new functions, constants, or complex mathematical routines that are not included in the default installation of `bc`. By using this option with a valid library file, users can perform more complex calculations and operations within the `bc` environment.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `bc` command is a popular calculator program in Unix-like operating systems. The option `--quiet` or simply `-q` is used to suppress the display of messages or prompts during execution, making the calculation result be the only output shown. In summary, the `bc --quiet` command runs the `bc` calculator with quiet mode, which means it will only print the result and no other messages or prompts.'
        standard: '[AI] The `bc` command with the `--standard` flag is a calculator and programming language for the Bunbury Computing System (BCS). This flag sets the default arithmetic context to the one defined by the ANSI X3.159-1985 standard for BCS. It specifies that variables begin with an uppercase letter, and arithmetic operations are performed using postfix notation, among other things. Without this flag, `bc` would use a different default context.'
        version: '[AI] The `bc` command with the `--version` option is used to display the version information of the bc (Basic Calculator) utility installed on a Unix or Unix-like operating system. When executed with this option, it prints out the name of the bc version, its release date, and sometimes additional details such as the operating system it was built for. This helps users to verify that they have the correct version of bc installed and to check for updates if necessary.'
        warn: '[AI] `bc` is a popular command-line calculator in Unix-like operating systems. The `--warn` flag is an option used with `bc`. It modifies the behavior of `bc` to emit warning messages for certain conditions, such as attempting to divide by zero or taking the square root of a negative number. By default, `bc` does not issue any warnings in such cases. Using `bc --warn` enables these warnings, allowing users to be aware of potential errors and avoid unexpected results in their calculations.'
