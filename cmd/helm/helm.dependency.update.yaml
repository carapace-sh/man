    command: '[AI] `helm dependency update` is a command used in Helm, the popular Kubernetes Package Manager. This command is utilized to fetch and update the dependencies defined in a Helm chart''s `values.yaml` or ` Chart.lock` file. It ensures that the specified dependencies are of the latest stable versions, enhancing your Helm chart''s compatibility and functionality. By running `helm dependency update`, you can maintain a healthy ecosystem for your application development in Kubernetes.'
    flag:
        keyring: '[AI] `helm dependency update --keyring` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command updates Helm''s dependency keyrings, which are used to authenticate and verify the authenticity of the charts that are being installed or upgraded. The `--keyring` flag specifies the location of the keyring file. By updating this file, you ensure that you have the most recent public keys for the repositories from which you''ll be installing Helm charts. This is important for maintaining the security and integrity of your Kubernetes clusters.'
        skip-refresh: '[AI] `helm dependency update --skip-refresh` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to update dependencies without refreshing the charts repository. When you run `helm dependency update`, Helm checks for updates to the dependencies declared in your chart''s `values.yaml` file and installs them. The `--skip-refresh` flag skips the step where Helm would fetch the latest versions of charts from the repositories, assuming that your local charts repository is already up-to-date. This can save time if you frequently update dependencies and don''t want to wait for the chart repository download each time.'
        verify: |-
            [AI] `helm dependency update --verify` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes packaging and deployment tool. This command performs two main actions:

            1. It updates the dependencies listed in a Helm chart's `values.yaml`, `requirements.yaml`, or ` Chart.lock` file to their latest versions, ensuring they are up-to-date with the current state of the charts' repositories.
            2. After updating, it runs a verification step to ensure that the new dependencies do not conflict with each other and are compatible with the chart as a whole. This is done by analyzing the `Chart.lock` file to see if all the updated dependencies can be installed together in the target Kubernetes cluster without conflicts. If any potential conflicts are detected, Helm will report an error and prevent the update from proceeding.
