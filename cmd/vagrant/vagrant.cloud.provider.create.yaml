    -C, --checksum-type=: Type of checksum used (md5, sha1, sha256, sha384, sha512). --checksum option is required.
    -c, --checksum=: Checksum of the box for this provider. --checksum-type option is required.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud provider create` command is used to create a new Vagrant Cloud provider definition in Ruby. A Vagrant Cloud provider defines how to interact with an external service, such as a public cloud platform or a Docker registry, to manage and provision Vagrant boxes. This command initializes a new provider project with the required structure and files. It sets up a basic Git repository, a Rakefile for building and testing the provider, and a `config.rb` file for defining the provider''s configuration options. After running this command, you can start developing your custom Vagrant Cloud provider.'
    flag:
        checksum: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud provider create --checksum` command is used to create a new Vagrant cloud box (a pre-packaged virtual machine image) with a specific checksum. This means that the command will generate a new box based on the given provider and configuration, and then calculate and output the checksum of the resulting image. This can be useful for ensuring that a particular version of a box is used in your Vagrant projects and that it has not been tampered with during transfer or storage. The checksum acts as a verification mechanism to confirm the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded box.'
        checksum-type: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud provider create --checksum-type` command is used when creating a new Vagrant box on Vagrant Cloud. This option specifies the type of checksum to be generated for the box file, which can be either "sha1" or "sha256". The chosen checksum type determines the length and level of security of the hash value used to verify the integrity of the downloaded box file. Using a stronger checksum type like sha256 provides an increased level of security against potential tampering or manipulation of the box file during transmission or storage.'
