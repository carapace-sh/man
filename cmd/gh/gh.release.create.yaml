documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh release create` is a GitHub command used to create a new GitHub Release for a specific Git tag or commit in a repository. It takes the name of the release and an optional draft or prerelease flag as arguments, enabling you to publish releases with custom names, descriptions, and versions. This command facilitates managing and distributing software packages or updates within the GitHub ecosystem.'
    flag:
        discussion-category: '[AI] `gh release create` is a GitHub command used to create a new release for a GitHub repository. The `--discussion-category` option sets the discussion category for the new release. This determines which GitHub discussion tab the release will be associated with when created. By default, this is set to "Releases", but it can be changed to other categories such as "Announcements" or "Bugs" to help organize and prioritize discussions related to the release.'
        draft: '[AI] `gh release create --draft` is a GitHub command used to create a new GitHub release as a draft. A draft release is not published and visible to the public until it''s manually promoted to be a regular release. This command allows you to prepare a release with assets, tags, and notes in private before making it publicly available.'
        generate-notes: '[AI] `gh release create --generate-notes` is a GitHub command used to create a new GitHub release with a draft state and generate release notes based on the committed changes in the current branch or tag. The release will be published once the draft is approved. If no release title or description is provided, it will be taken from the most recent commit message.'
        latest: '[AI] `gh release create --latest` is a command used with GitHub''s `git-hub-pages` or `github-cli` tool to create or update a GitHub Release with the tag `latest`. This command fetches the most recent commit on the specified branch, creates a new tag named `latest`, and then creates or updates the release with that tag. The release note message defaults to the one from the most recent commit but can be overridden if desired. It''s often used when deploying applications automatically whenever there is a new version available in the GitHub repository.'
        notes: '[AI] `gh release create` is a GitHub command used to create a new GitHub Release. The `--notes` option allows you to provide release notes as arguments when creating the release. These notes will be displayed on the GitHub Release page, providing a clear description of the changes made in that release.'
        notes-file: '[AI] `gh release create` is a GitHub command used to create a new GitHub Release. The `--notes-file` option specifies a file containing release notes to be included in the new GitHub Release. When this option is used, the contents of the specified file are read and used as the release notes for the new GitHub Release.'
        notes-from-tag: '[AI] The `gh release create` command is used to create a new GitHub release in a repository. The `--notes-from-tag` option tells GitHub to use the tag message as the release notes when creating the new release. In other words, it sets the release notes to be equal to the commit message of the most recent tag for that specific branch or commit. This can help keep release notes up-to-date and consistent with the changes included in each new release.'
        notes-start-tag: '[AI] `gh release create` is a GitHub command used to create a new release for a repository. The `--notes-start-tag` option sets the tag name that will be used as the beginning of the release notes text. This allows you to easily reference specific commits or branches when writing release notes. For example, if you use the tag `v1.0.0`, running this command would create a new release with the notes starting at the commit or branch with that tag.'
        prerelease: '[AI] `gh release create --prerelease` is a command in GitHub''s `git-hub` tool for managing GitHub releases. It creates a new release with a prerelease tag. Prereleases are preliminary versions of a release, often used for beta testing or to provide early access to new features. The created prerelease is drafted initially and can be promoted to a regular release once it''s ready, making the entire process streamlined and automated using GitHub tools.'
        target: '[AI] `gh release create --target` is a command used in the GitHub Flow deployment strategy with GitHub''s GitHubActions or GitHub''s CLI tool (gh). It creates a new GitHub Release for the current repository and sets the specified target as its tag. The target refers to a specific commit, branch, or tag on the repository. This command prepares a release for deployment by packaging the artifacts and creating an associated GitHubRelease object in the GitHub interface.'
        title: '[AI] The `gh release create` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new GitHub release for a specific repository. The `--title` option sets the title for the release. In simpler terms, it creates a new Git tagged release with the given title on the specified repository.'
        verify-tag: '[AI] `gh release create --verify-tag` is a command used in GitHub''s Git-over-HTTPS (gh) CLI tool for creating a new GitHub Release with a specified tag. The `--verify-tag` option ensures that the specified tag exists and points to a valid commit before creating the release. This helps to prevent accidentally creating a release from an incorrect or non-existent commit.'
