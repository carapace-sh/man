description: Interact with environment variables associated with Conda environments
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `conda-env config vars` is a command used in Anaconda''s Conda environment management system to configure and set variables for a specific Conda environment. This command modifies or creates `.yml` files located in the `.conda/envs/{env_name}/` directory, which define custom configurations and overrides for Conda environments. These variables can include PATH settings, defining custom channels for package installation, or any other configuration option supported by Conda. The use of this command allows users to fine-tune their Conda environments with specific settings not available through standard environment creation methods.'
