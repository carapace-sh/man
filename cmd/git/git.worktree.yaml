documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git worktree` is a Git command used to manage multiple working directories or repositories for a single Git project. It allows you to create, list, and delete alternate references to your Git repository at different paths, which can be useful when working on multiple features or branches, or when collaborating with team members. For example, `git worktree add <path> <commit-ish>` creates a new working directory at the specified path, referencing the given commit-ish (branch or tag), while `git worktree list` shows all the existing worktrees associated with the repository.'
