        [AI] The `npm bugs` command is used to report a bug in a package listed in your `package.json` file or currently installed with Node.js and npm. It opens a new issue in the package's GitHub repository with the specified replication steps and other relevant information automatically filled out.

        You can use it as follows:

        ```
        npm bugs <package-name>
        ```

        Replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package where you found the bug. This command is particularly useful when you want to report an issue quickly and easily without having to navigate to the GitHub page manually.
    flag:
        browser: '[AI] The `npm bugs --browser` command is used with npm (Node Package Manager) to report reproducible browser-related bugs in packages listed in the project''s package.json file. It sends an email to the maintainers of those projects, including a link to create a new issue on GitHub for the reported bug. This helps developers address and fix issues that may affect other users using their packages in web projects.'
