documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pwait` command in Unix-based systems is used to wait for background processes to finish execution before continuing with the current shell session. It allows you to check the exit status of completed jobs, providing more control and flexibility compared to using the simple `wait` command. With `pwait`, you can see the progress of each job individually as they terminate, making it useful in scripts or situations where you need to keep track of multiple background processes.'
    flag:
        count: '[AI] `pwait --count` is a command in Git, specifically for the `parallels` extension, which waits for all running child processes to finish before returning an exit status. The `--count` option displays the number of child processes that were run and how many have completed successfully or failed. It provides useful information about the completion status of parallel jobs in Git.'
        echo: '[AI] `pwait --echo` is a command in GNU Parallel that is used to wait for all jobs to finish and then print their exit codes and output on the terminal. The `--echo` option causes the output of each job to be printed as it finishes, providing real-time feedback during the execution of the parallel jobs. When all jobs have finished, GNU Parallel exits with the exit code of the last job that terminated.'
        euid: '[AI] `pwait --euid` is a command in Procfs, a Linux kernel subsystem that provides an interface for interacting with running processes. The `pwait` command itself is used to wait for the termination of a specified process and then return its exit status. The option `--euid` is used to specify the effective user ID of the process being waited for instead of the process ID (PID). This can be useful when dealing with processes that have changed their ID or when working with set-user-ID programs.'
        exact: '[AI] `pwait --exact` is a command in Git, specifically used with the `git pull` or `git fetch` commands. It sets Git to wait for resources (such as files or processes) to be released before continuing, ensuring that no conflicts occur during the merge process. This is particularly useful when working on large or complex projects where multiple changes may be happening concurrently. The `--exact` option specifies that only an exact match between local and remote branches is acceptable for a successful merge or fetch operation. If there are any discrepancies, Git will not proceed until the issue is resolved.'
        full: '[AI] `pwait --full` is a command in Git, specifically a subcommand of the `git` pporfit-wip (work in progress) tool. This command is used to wait for and display detailed information about process or job IDs that are blocked due to Git''s background processing. The `--full` option increases the amount of information displayed, including the commit messages and parent hashes, making it useful for debugging complex workflows or understanding long-running Git operations.'
        group: '[AI] The `pwait` command with the `--group` option is a utility in Git, specifically used during merging or rebase processes. It helps to ensure that parent processes of a given process complete before allowing the given process to continue. With `--group`, all processes within a single Git process group will be waited for collectively, meaning the entire group finishes before any individual process moves on. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex merge or rebase scenarios involving multiple commits or branches.'
        help: '[AI] `pwait` is a command-line utility in Perl, often used in Unix-like environments for waiting on multiple background processes to finish before continuing execution. The `--help` option displays detailed usage information about the `pwait` command, including its syntax and available options. It provides an interactive interface that allows users to specify process IDs or patterns to wait for, as well as various timeouts and other configurations. Using `pwait --help` will provide a clear explanation of these features and how to utilize them effectively.'
        ignore-case: '[AI] `pwait` is a command in Proctools package for Go language, used to wait for child processes and collect their exit codes. The `--ignore-case` option modifies its behavior to perform case-insensitive pattern matching when filtering child process names. For instance, `pwait --ignore-case "process*"` will match and wait for any child processes whose names contain the string "process" regardless of casing (upper or lower).'
        logpidfile: '[AI] `pwait --logpidfile` is a command from the Git Bash environment, specifically a part of the `parse-options` script in Git for Unix-like systems. This option is used with the `git log` command and it instructs Git to wait for background processes related to the log output before exiting or returning control to the shell. The `--logpidfile` argument writes the process ID of these background jobs to a file named by the given argument, instead of printing them to the terminal. This allows users to capture and manage these process IDs in scripts or for later reference.'
        newest: '[AI] `pwait --newest` is a command in Git, specifically a subcommand of the `pgrep`-like utility `pwait`. This command waits for processes matched by a given pattern to finish and prints their exit statuses, but with the `--newest` option, it will only print the status of the most recently finished process. In other words, it shows the exit status of the last matching process that terminated among those currently available. This can be useful for quickly checking the exit status of the most recent command in a pipeline or script.'
        ns: '[AI] `pwait --ns` is a command in the Procfs filesystem of Linux systems. The `pwait` utility is used to wait for a process with a given Process ID (PID) and print its exit status once it terminates. The option `--ns` stands for "no status" which means that only the exit status will be printed, without any other information like process name or elapsed time.'
        nslist: |-
            [AI] `pwait --nslist` is a command used in Procfile, which is a configuration file for the PM2 process manager in Node.js environments. The `--nslist` option of the `pwait` command is used to list the namespaces that are attached to a specific process identified by its PID (Process ID).

            When you run `pwait --nslist <PID>`, it will display the list of namespaces and their respective current state for the specified process. These namespaces include things like Network, Mount, IPC, UTS, etc., providing information about how that process is isolated from other processes in the system.
        older: '[AI] `pwait --older` is a command in Git, specifically used with `git bisect`. It waits for all background processes of a previousbisect run to finish before starting a new one. The `--older` flag indicates that it should use the commit hash that was last used by the bisect command instead of the current HEAD. This is useful when you want to continue a previously interrupted bisect session.'
        oldest: '[AI] `pwait --oldest` is a command in Git, specifically part of the `parallels` subsystem. It''s used to wait for completed child processes in a parallel Git workflow. The `--oldest` option ensures that the script waits for the oldest finished process first. This can be helpful when dealing with large or complex operations where you want to ensure that results from earlier tasks are processed before moving on to later ones.'
        parent: |-
            [AI] The `pwait` command with the `--parent` option is used in Unix-based systems to wait for a specific parent process to terminate before the current process exits. This can be useful in scripting or automation tasks where you want to ensure that a child process does not finish until its parent has completed execution.

            When using `pwait --parent PID`, replace `PID` with the Process ID of the parent process you are waiting for. The current process will then pause and resume only when the parent process terminates or is sent a signal indicating that it should be terminated. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where the child process relies on the state or output of the parent process to complete its own task.
        pgroup: '[AI] `pwait --pgroup` is a utility command in Procfile, used in the context of the Process file format for Heroku and similar platforms. It''s employed to wait for a specific process group (a set of related processes) to finish before continuing with further tasks. By passing `--pgroup` option followed by the name or ID of the process group, this command ensures that only when all processes within that group have completed their tasks, will the next sequence of commands be executed. This behavior enables better control and coordination over parallel processing in a more complex application setup.'
        pidfile: '[AI] `pwait --pidfile` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems, specifically in the GNU Parallel package. The `--pidfile` option tells GNU Parallel to write the process ID of the parallel job into a specified file upon completion. The flag ensures that parent processes wait for all child processes to finish before continuing execution. This can be useful for managing complex workflows or scripts where order of execution is critical.'
        runstates: '[AI] The `pwait` is a PowerShell cmdlet used to wait for one or more jobs to complete. The `--runstates` parameter specifies that `pwait` should only return once all specified jobs have entered the specified run states. Run states are specific phases of a job''s lifecycle, such as "Running," "Succeeded," "Failed," etc. By using `--runstates @("Running", "Succeeded")`, `pwait` will wait for all jobs to be in either the running or succeeded state before continuing.'
        session: '[AI] The `pwait` command in Unix-based systems, specifically when used with the `--session` option, is used to wait for all processes belonging to a specific Process Group ID (PGID) or Session ID (SID) to terminate. This can be particularly useful for monitoring and managing background jobs, as it allows the user to ensure that all related processes have finished before continuing with other tasks or logging out of the system. When used without additional options or arguments, `pwait` will wait for the foreground process group, but adding `--session` followed by a valid session ID will cause it to wait for that specific session instead.'
        terminal: '[AI] `pwait --terminal` is a command used in Git Bash or other Unix-like environments, typically within shell scripts. It''s an alias for `pgrep -f` and `xargs -I {} sh -c ''tcsetpgrp 0 {} && exec bash {} --init-file <(cat "$HOME/.bashrc")''`, which is used to wait for a process with the given name or matching pattern to terminate, then open a new terminal window (or current terminal if running interactively) and execute the process in it. This can be useful when working with long-running scripts or processes that need to be monitored closely.'
        uid: '[AI] `pwait --uid` is a Unix command used in shell scripting to wait for a process with a specific user ID (UID) to terminate before continuing execution. The `pwait` utility is an extension of the standard Unix `wait` command, providing more advanced features like the ability to specify a UID instead of a process ID. By using `--uid <UID>`, you can wait for any child process belonging to that user to finish.'
        version: '[AI] `pwait --version` is a command used in Perl programming language to check the version of the `pwait` module installed in your system. When executed, it prints out the specific version number of the module along with some other relevant information such as the release date and the Git commit hash if applicable. This helps in ensuring that you are using a compatible version for your intended usage.'
