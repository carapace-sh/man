documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pamac search` is a command used in Pacman-based Arch Linux package managers (such as Pamac) to search for available packages in the repositories. It returns a list of packages matching the given keyword or description, along with their names and brief descriptions.'
    flag:
        aur: '[AI] `pacman` is a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. The command `pacman search --aur` is used to search the Arch User Repository (AUR) for packages that match a given keyword or description. The `--aur` option specifies that the search should be limited to the AUR, which is a collection of community-maintained packages that are not part of the official Arch Linux repositories. The output will list the package names and descriptions.'
        files: '[AI] `pamac search --files` is a command used in the Pamac package manager for Arch Linux. It searches for files or packages containing specified text patterns in their descriptions, names, or provisioning files. The output includes the matching file paths or package names along with relevant details like version and size. This can be useful for locating specific files within installed packages or finding packages related to a particular topic.'
        installed: '[AI] `pamac search --installed` is a command used in Arch Linux and its derivatives to search for installed packages in the system''s Pacman package manager database. The command takes no arguments, and when run, it returns a list of packages currently installed on the system. It can be helpful in quickly checking which packages are present or verifying that a specific package is indeed installed.'
        no-aur: '[AI] `pamac` is a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. The command `pamac search --no-aur` performs a search for packages in the official Arch User Repository (AUR) without installing any Automatic Updates (AUR helper scripts). These scripts can automatically build and install packages from source, but they may require user intervention to complete successfully. By using `--no-aur`, users can restrict their search to only those packages that are available in the officially maintained repositories.'
        quiet: '[AI] `pamac search --quiet` is a command from Pamac, a package manager for Arch Linux. This command searches the Arch Linux repositories for packages that match a given query, but with the `--quiet` option it only prints the names of the matching packages and nothing else, making the output minimal and focused on the search results.'
        repos: '[AI] `pacman` is a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives, allowing users to easily install, upgrade, or remove software packages from their system. The command `pacman search --repos` is used to search for packages available in the repositories (i.e., official or custom third-party) that are registered with `pacman`. This command can be followed by a keyword or package name, and it returns a list of packages that match the search term along with their names, descriptions, and repository information. The output helps users determine which repositories contain the desired package and if they should update or add those repositories to install the software.'
