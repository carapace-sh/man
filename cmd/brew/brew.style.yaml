documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `brew style` command is a part of Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. It checks your current directory and the installed Homebrew Formulae for potential issues or inconsistencies against the Homebrew House Style Guide. The output provides suggestions for improving the code to adhere to Homebrew''s best practices. Using `brew style` can help ensure that your custom Formulae follow a consistent format and are easier to maintain and understand for other users in the Homebrew community.'
    flag:
        cask: '[AI] `brew style --cask` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to check the compatibility and consistency of installing a Cask (a type of package managed by Homebrew that installs and manages Mac applications) with your current system. It provides an overview of potential conflicts or issues, ensuring a smooth installation process. The command does not actually install anything but only checks the readiness for installation.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew style --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs a check on your system''s installed packages against Homebrew''s recommended configurations. The `--debug` flag enables detailed output, providing more information about each check and any potential issues or warnings discovered during the analysis.'
        except-cops: '[AI] The `--except-cops` flag is a custom option used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux. It modifies the regular `brew install` or `brew upgrade` command to exclude packages whose names contain the string "cop" in their formula name. In other words, it skips the installation or upgrade of packages that might be related to law enforcement or surveillance software. This can be useful for users who want to avoid unintentionally installing such packages.'
        fix: '[AI] `brew style --fix` is a command provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux. It automatically checks your system for packages installed via Homebrew that have outdated formulae or dependencies, and applies any recommended fixes to bring those packages up-to-date and maintain optimal functionality. In essence, it''s a convenience feature that simplifies the process of ensuring your Homebrew installations are current and secure.'
        formula: '[AI] `brew style --formula` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command checks the syntactical and structural correctness of a Homebrew Formula, which defines how to build, install, and manage software packages using Homebrew. The formula specifies various details such as dependencies, build processes, and post-install scripts. Running `brew style --formula` on a given formula checks its adherence to the official Homebrew style guide, ensuring consistency across the ecosystem.'
        help: '[AI] `brew style --help` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux. This command displays detailed help information about the `brew style` subcommand. It provides guidelines for making packages conform to the Homebrew project''s coding standards, ensuring consistency across all packages. This can improve maintainability, readability, and overall quality of Homebrew packages.'
        only-cops: '[AI] The `--only-cops` option in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux, is used to install only casks (graphical user interface applications) that are tagged as Coprs. Coprs are unofficial and often community-maintained repositories of Homebrew casks. Using `--only-cops` ensures that only these repositories are checked for updates or new installations when running commands like `brew upgrade` or `brew install`.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `--quiet` flag in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux, is used to suppress informational messages during the installation or upgrade of packages. It helps to keep the terminal output minimal and focused on the progress of the command without unnecessary interruptions.'
        reset-cache: '[AI] The `--reset-cache` flag in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux, is used to clear the cache of installed packages and their dependencies. This action helps resolve issues with corrupted or outdated files, and allows Homebrew to rebuild and install packages from scratch when running an installation or upgrade command. It''s essential for troubleshooting and maintaining a healthy Homebrew environment.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `--verbose` flag is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux. When running a Homebrew command with this flag, it provides more detailed output about the operation being performed. This can include additional debugging information, progress indicators, and error messages. It helps users understand what Homebrew is doing behind the scenes and can be useful for troubleshooting or monitoring complex tasks.'
