documentation:
    command: '[AI] `hugo server` is a command used in Hugo, a popular open-source static site generator for building websites and blogs. This specific command starts Hugo''s development server. It watches your source files for changes, generates the updated website using Hugo''s engine, and automatically serves the new content on a local web server at a default address (usually `http://localhost:1313`). The primary purpose of this command is to facilitate live reloading during website development by continuously generating and updating your site as you make changes.'
    flag:
        appendPort: '[AI] `hugo server --appendPort` is a command used with Hugo, a popular static site generator for building websites and blogs in Go. The `--appendPort` option tells Hugo to automatically assign an available port number to its built-in development server besides the default port 131312. This allows multiple instances of Hugo servers running on the same machine without conflicting with each other.'
        baseURL: '[AI] The `hugo server --baseURL` command is used to start Hugo, a popular static site generator, in its built-in development server mode. The `--baseURL` option specifies the base URL of the generated website. This is important because it tells Hugo how to construct the relative paths to resources like images or CSS files, ensuring that they are served correctly when accessed from the browser. The format for the base URL is usually a string starting with "/" and followed by the path prefix of your site, such as "/mywebsitename/".'
        bind: '[AI] `hugo server --bind` is a command used with Hugo, a popular static site generator for creating blogs or websites. The `--bind` option specifies the interface to bind the Hugo development server to. By default, it listens on localhost (127.0.0.1) only. However, using `--bind` followed by an IP address or domain name allows accessing the site from other devices in the same network or remotely. For example, `hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0` will make the site publicly accessible on your machine''s IP address.'
        buildDrafts: '[AI] `hugo server --buildDrafts` is a command used in Hugo, a popular static site generator for building websites. This specific command starts Hugo''s development server with the `--buildDrafts` flag enabled. This flag tells Hugo to also build and serve draft or unpublished content. In contrast, by default, only published content is served when using `hugo server`. This command is useful during content creation and editing stages when you want to see the changes in real-time on a local web server.'
        buildExpired: '[AI] `hugo server --buildExpired` is a command used in Hugos static site generator to build and serve a website, with an added flag to keep expired files. By default, Hugo removes files that are no longer being used from the output directory during the build process. However, the `--buildExpired` flag prevents this behavior, keeping all files regardless of their usage in the final output. This can be useful for testing or debugging purposes when analyzing the behavior of the site generator with older or expired files.'
        buildFuture: '[AI] `hugo server --buildFuture` is a command used in Hugo, a popular static site generator for creating blogs and websites. This specific command starts Hugo''s development server with build future enabled. Build future allows the server to compile and serve multiple versions of your site, supporting time-traveling URLs. These URLs enable previewing content changes before publishing and rolling back to previous versions if needed. It essentially caches multiple builds, enabling easy access to past revisions.'
        cacheDir: '[AI] `hugo server --cacheDir` is a command used in Hugo, a popular static site generator for creating blogs and websites. This specific command starts Hugo''s development server with the specified cache directory. The cacheDir argument indicates the location where Hugo will store its compiled intermediate files during the build process to serve them faster on subsequent requests. It helps improve the server''s performance by reducing the need to rebuild all the files every time the server is restarted.'
        cleanDestinationDir: '[AI] The `hugo server --cleanDestinationDir` command is used to start Hugo, a static site generator, in production mode with a clean destination directory. This means that all files in the output directory (specified by the `--destination` flag) will be deleted before generating new content. This can be useful when you want to ensure that the output directory starts with a completely fresh slate before generating new content. For example, if you''re making repeated changes to your site and want to see the results of each change in isolation, this command would help achieve that.'
        contentDir: '[AI] `hugo server --contentDir` is a command used with Hugo, a popular open-source website engine written in Go. This specific command starts Hugo''s development server with the given content directory as the source for building and serving the site. It automatically watches for changes in the content directory and rebuilds the site accordingly, making it ideal for local development and testing.'
        destination: '[AI] The `hugo server --destination` command is used to start Hugo, a popular static site generator for creating blogs and websites, in server mode with the added functionality of specifying an output directory for generated files. This flag allows developers to see their changes in real-time without having to rebuild the entire site every time. The site continues running on a local web server at `http://localhost:1313` by default, and any changes made to Hugo source files are automatically rebuilt and served from the specified destination directory.'
        disableBrowserError: '[AI] The `hugo server --disableBrowserError` command is used to start Hugo, a popular static site generator, with an option that disables browser error warnings. This can be useful when developing a website locally and encountering repeated browser console messages that are not critical to the development process. By using this flag, these non-critical errors or warnings will be suppressed, allowing for a cleaner development environment and reducing potential distractions.'
        disableFastRender: '[AI] `hugo server --disableFastRender` is a command used with Hugo, a popular static site generator for creating blogs or websites. The `--disableFastRender` option disables the use of Hugo''s fast render mode, which employs fewer transformations and preprocessing steps compared to a full build. This results in potentially faster development server start-up time but might yield less optimized output files. It''s useful when you want to test changes quickly without waiting for a complete rebuild or when working on more complex templates.'
        disableKinds: '[AI] The `hugo server --disableKinds` command is used in Hugo, a popular static site generator for creating blogs and websites. The `--disableKinds` flag disables specific content types or kinds in Hugo''s build process. When this flag is passed to the `hugo server` command, it starts the development server without building certain content types defined by their Hugo kind. This allows for faster development iterations and testing changes without rebuilding all content types each time. Commonly used with specific kinds like `sections`, `taxonomies`, or `shortcodes`.'
        disableLiveReload: '[AI] `hugo server` is a command used to start Hugo, a popular static site generator, in production mode with a built-in development server. The `--disableLiveReload` option disables live reloading of the browser when file changes are detected. This means that when you save a change in your Hugo source files, the browser will not automatically update the display. Instead, you must manually refresh the page to see the updated content. This can be useful when working on a large site where live reloading may cause performance issues or interfere with other processes.'
        enableGitInfo: |-
            [AI] `hugo server --enableGitInfo` is a command used with Hugo, a popular static site generator for building websites and blogs. This specific command starts Hugo's development server with an additional feature enabled – Git Info.

It helps to provide useful metadata for each page, especially when working in a version control system. With `--enableGitInfo`, this information will be automatically added to your Hugo-generated site during development, making it easier to see these details while building or testing your site locally.
        forceSyncStatic: '[AI] The `hugo server --forceSyncStatic` command is used to start Hugo, a popular static site generator, in production mode with forced static file syncing. In this mode, Hugo will rebuild the website from scratch each time a change is detected in the source files or templates. This ensures that any changes made to the content or layout are immediately reflected on the server without requiring a manual `hugo` build and file transfer process. The `--forceSyncStatic` flag forces Hugo to overwrite existing static files during the build process, ensuring that the latest versions of these files are served to the user.'
        gc: '[AI] `hugo server --gc` is a command used with Hugo, a popular static site generator written in Go. The `--gc` flag enables the Garbage Collector (GC) during the server build process. By default, Hugo''s server does not run the GC. However, enabling it can help free up memory and prevent potential issues with long-running servers by forcing garbage collection more frequently. This command starts the Hugo server with garbage collection enabled, allowing for a more stable and efficient development environment.'
        i18n-warnings: |-
            [AI] The `hugo server --i18n-warnings` command is used to start Hugo, a popular static site generator, in production mode with internationalization (i18n) warnings enabled.

            When generating a multilingual website with Hugo, i18n warnings can occur when Hugo identifies potential issues with the configuration of language files or content. These warnings don't prevent the build from completing but can cause inconsistencies in how content is displayed across different languages.

            By including the `--i18n-warnings` flag, these warnings will be printed to the console during the build process, allowing you to address them before publishing your site. This can help ensure a more accurate and consistent translation experience for your users.
        ignoreCache: '[AI] `hugo server --ignoreCache` is a command used with Hugo, a popular static site generator. This command starts Hugo''s development server with the `--ignoreCache` flag enabled.
