documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `man` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems used to read the manual pages of other commands, programs, or functions. When you type `man` followed by the name of a command or topic (for example, `man ls`), your terminal opens the corresponding manual page in a format that''s typically easy to navigate with pagination keys. The displayed manual includes detailed information such as usage instructions, examples, options, and explanations of the underlying concepts. This command provides an essential resource for users to learn about various functionalities within their system.'
    flag:
        S: '[AI] The `man -S` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to search for manual pages (documents describing how to use a specific command or program) based on a regular expression pattern instead of an exact string match. The `-S` option stands for "regexp search". For example, `man -S ''int[r]o''` would display the manual pages that have the words "into" or "intro" in their titles or summaries.'
        all: |-
            [AI] The `man --all` command is not a standard flag or option in Unix-like operating systems. It seems to be misspelled or incomplete, as `man` is typically a command for displaying documentation, and the `--all` flag is not part of its usage.

            If you meant to use other common flags with the `man` command such as `--k`, `--apropos`, or `--whatis` to search for specific keywords across all installed man pages, those are valid options that provide quick access to related documentation.
        apropos: '[AI] The `man --apropos` command is a part of Unix and Unix-like operating systems, specifically a utility under the `man` page system. It searches for keywords or phrases in the system''s installed man pages (short for "management pages") and displays a list of relevant man pages, providing quick access to information related to specific topics. For instance, if you type `man --apropos ''ssh''`, it will show you a list of man pages that include the keyword ''ssh''.'
        ascii: '[AI] The `man --ascii` command is used to display the manual pages of Linux commands in ASCII format. Manual pages are documentation files that come with most Linux software and provide information on how to use the software. By default, these pages are displayed in a pager format like `less` or `more`, which includes formatting and color. However, with the `--ascii` option, manual pages are shown as plain text without any additional formatting or colorization. This can be useful for those who prefer to read the documentation in a simple, uncluttered way or when working in a terminal environment that does not support formatting or colorization.'
        catman: '[AI] The command `man catman` in Linux or Unix-based systems is used to display the manual page associated with a command or utility named "catman". Manual pages provide detailed information about various commands, functions, and libraries available on the system. The flag `man` is not necessary here since it''s an inherent part of the man command itself. When you type `man catman`, the terminal will display the manual page related to "catman" in your terminal window.'
        config-file: |-
            [AI] The `--config-file` option in the `man` command is used to specify a custom configuration file instead of using the default one. This option is typically used when the user wants to customize the format or other aspects of the man pages display without modifying the system-wide configuration.

            The specified file should be a valid manpage configuration file, which can contain various directives for formatting and customizing the appearance of manpages when they are displayed using the `man` command. For example, the user may want to change the font size, page layout, or other display options.

            The path to the configuration file should be provided as an argument after the `--config-file` option, for instance: `man --config-file=/path/to/custom.conf section command`.
        debug: '[AI] The `--debug` flag in a command like `man --debug`, is used to enable debug mode for the Man page command in Unix-like operating systems. Debug mode provides more detailed output or information, which can be useful for troubleshooting issues with the Man pages themselves or when working on system customization and configuration tasks. The flag causes Man to produce additional diagnostic messages and possibly other debugging information during operation.'
        default: '[AI] The `--default` option in GNU `man` command is used to set or view the default manual page for a specific command or topic. When invoked with no arguments, it displays the currently set default manual page. If followed by a SECTION number or COMMAND name, it sets the default to that section or command''s manual page. For instance: `man --default=3` sets the default to section 3 manuals, while `man --default=grep` sets the default to the `grep` command''s manual page.'
        ditroff: |-
            [AI] The `--ditoff` option is not a valid flag for the `man` command in Linux or Unix-like systems. The `man` command is used to display the manual pages of various Linux commands and utilities. It takes arguments, such as the name of the command or utility whose manual page you want to view. For example, `man ls` will display the manual page for the `ls` command.

            Therefore, there is no flag named `--ditoff` in the `man` command. If you encounter this option, it might be a typo or a mistake.
        encoding: '[AI] The `man --encoding` command is used to set or check the encoding of a Man page file. Man pages are documentation files that come with many Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The `man` command with the `--encoding` option allows specifying or querying the character encoding format (such as UTF-8) of the Man page file, ensuring correct display of non-ASCII characters.'
        extension: '[AI] The `--extension` flag is used with various command line tools in Unix-like operating systems, including GNU `find` and `man`. When used with `man`, the `--extension` flag filters the manual pages based on their file extensions. For example, `man --extension=.txt` would display only the manual pages with a .txt extension. This can be useful when dealing with a large number of manual pages and wanting to focus on those related to specific types of files.'
        global-apropos: '[AI] The `man --global-apropos` command is used with the man pages in Unix or Linux systems. It searches for keywords across all installed man pages, displaying a list of man pages that include the specified keyword in their documentation. The `--global` option indicates that the search should be performed system-wide, as opposed to just in the current directory or the default manual section.'
        gxditview: '[AI] The command `man --gxditview` is used to display the manual pages of Linux commands using the `gxditview` pager instead of the default `less` or `more`. `man` is a command-line utility for accessing documentation of other Unix or Unix-like commands. The `--gxditview` option specifies that the output should be displayed using the `gxditview` pager, which offers features like search and regular expression support.'
        help: '[AI] The `--help` option when used with the `man` command in Unix-like operating systems displays detailed help information about a given command or utility. When you type `man --help` in a terminal, it will show you a brief description of what the man command does and how to use it effectively, including available options and common uses. This is useful for quickly understanding the capabilities of commands without having to remember their specific syntax or consult extensive documentation.'
        html: '[AI] The `--flag man --html` is not a recognized command or flag in any common computing context. It seems to be a combination of two separate elements: `man`, which is a command-line utility used for accessing documentation, and `--html`, which is a flag indicating the output format as HTML (HyperText Markup Language). However, in standard usage, the `man` command does not take an `--html` flag, but rather displays its output in plain text by default. To view man pages in HTML format, there are other tools like `apmdoc`, `man2html`, or using web interfaces provided by some distributions.'
        ignore-case: '[AI] The `--ignore-case` flag is a command-line option used with various UNIX and GNU tools, such as `find`, `grep`, and others. It modifies the behavior of these commands by ignoring case distinctions when matching patterns. In other words, it makes pattern matching case-insensitive. For example, using `grep --ignore-case ''pattern'' file` will find lines containing ''pattern'' regardless of whether the characters in ''pattern'' are upper or lower case.'
        local-file: '[AI] The `man --local-file` command is used to display the manual page of a local file, instead of the one installed on the system. This option is particularly useful when you want to view a customized or modified version of a manual page that might not be available in the standard package. Provide the path to the local file as an argument. For instance, `man --local-file /path/to/your/customized_manual_page`.'
        locale: '[AI] The `man --locale` command is used to display the help text for the `man` command with a specific locale setting. Locale refers to the set of parameters that defines the format of data, such as dates and numbers, and the language for messages and commands. By specifying a locale using the `--locale` option, you can ensure that the `man` pages are displayed in your preferred format and language. For example, `man --locale=en_US.UTF-8` would display English man pages in UTF-8 encoding, while `man --locale=es_ES.UTF-8` would display Spanish man pages.'
        location: |-
            [AI] The `--location` flag is a command-line option used with the `man` (short for "Manual") utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. Its primary purpose is to display the manual page of a given command or program along with the location where the file is installed on the system.

            When invoked with this flag, the `man` command will not only show the textual description of the specified command but also provide the information about its location in the filesystem hierarchy under the `/usr/share/man` directory. This can be helpful for administrators and users who want to know exactly where a particular executable or library is installed, especially when dealing with multiple versions of software or different installations on their system.

            It's essential to note that using `--location` might produce more extensive output compared to the regular usage of the man command as it includes information about the file location.
        location-cat: '[AI] The command `man --location=Cat` is not a valid flag or command in Unix or Linux systems. The `man` command is used to display the manual pages of other commands, while `--location` is an optional argument that can be used with it to quickly navigate to a specific topic within the manual page. However, there''s no such predefined location as "Cat". If you meant to use a different option or command, please provide the correct information for a proper explanation.'
        manpath: '[AI] The `--manpath` option in the `man` command is used to set or display the directory or directories where the Manual pages are installed on a Unix-like operating system. It overrides the default Manual page search path and allows specifying multiple paths, separated by colons (:`:`). For example, setting `--manpath` to `/usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man` will search for Manual pages in both directories when using the `man` command.'
        match-case: '[AI] The `--match-case` flag is a command-line option used with various Unix utilities, such as `grep`, `find`, and `sed`. It modifies the search behavior to perform case-sensitive matching of patterns against files or text. When this option is set, the search for a pattern will only match strings that exactly match the given case (upper or lower) in both the file contents and the search term. This can be useful when working with files or data containing mixed case text where preserving the original casing is important.'
        names-only: '[AI] The `--names-only` flag is a command-line option for some Unix-like tools, most notably `man`, the manual page viewer. When used with `man`, it instructs the tool to only display the names of the topics in its database and not show their full documentation pages. This can be useful when you''re looking for a specific topic but don''t need or want to read through its entire documentation.'
        nh: '[AI] The `man --help` command is used to display help or documentation for other commands in Unix-like operating systems. The `--nh` option, if present, tells the `man` command to display the help text without formatting it with headings and other special formatting. This can be useful when you want a plain text output of the help information for further processing or redirection to another command or file.'
        nj: |-
            [AI] The command `man --nj` is not a valid flag or command in Unix or Linux environments. The `man` command is used to access the manual pages of various Linux commands and utilities. When called with no arguments, it displays a list of all installed manual pages.

            The `--nj` flag is not recognized by `man`. To display a specific manual page, use the syntax `man [command]`, where `[command]` is the name of the command or utility you want to learn about. For example, `man ls` would display the manual page for the `ls` command, which lists files and directories in a directory.
        no-hyphenation: '[AI] The `--no-hyphenation` flag is an option used with some text processing tools like `man` or `texlive`. It inhibits automatic hyphenation of long words at the end of lines when formatting text. This can be useful for ensuring consistent word spacing and avoiding potential misalignments in certain typesetting contexts.'
        no-justification: '[AI] The `man --no-justification` flag is used with the Unix `man` command to prevent the display of justification when viewing manual pages. Justification refers to the automatic adjustment of text in columns, making it aligned and evenly spaced. By using this flag, the output will be displayed without justification, preserving the original format and layout of the manual page content.'
        no-subpages: '[AI] The `--no-subpages` option in Git is used when running the `git flag manifest` command to exclude sub-pages from the generated man page. This can be useful when building the man pages locally for a smaller project, as including sub-pages can add unnecessary complexity and increase file size. By using `--no-subpages`, only the top-level pages will be generated.'
        pager: |-
            [AI] The `--pager` option in GNU `man` command is used to control how the output of the manual page is displayed. By default, `man` sends its output to the terminal's scrolling pager (usually `less` or `more`) for convenient viewing. However, with `--pager` you can specify an alternative pager program if desired. The basic syntax is:

            ```sh
            man [SECTION] [topic] --pager=pager_program
            ```

            Replace `[SECTION]`, `[topic]` with the manual section and topic, respectively, and `pager_program` with the name of the desired pager program. For instance:

            ```sh
            man 1 bash --pager=vim
            ```

            This command will display the Bash manual page using the Vim pager instead of the default one.
        path: '[AI] The `--path` option in GNU `man` command is used to specify the directories where the manual pages are located. It overrides the default locations defined in the `MANPATH` environment variable. Multiple directories can be provided separated by a colon (:`:`). For example, `man --path=/usr/local/man:/usr/share/man` will search for the manual pages in `/usr/local/man` and then in `/usr/share/man`.'
        preprocessor: '[AI] The `--preprocessor` flag is a command-line option used with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and other compilers that support the GCC infrastructure. It instructs the compiler to only run the preprocessing stage on the source code files specified, without performing further compilation or linking steps. Preprocessing involves expanding macros and including header files as directed by `#include` directives in the source code. The output of this step is then passed on for further compilation if desired.'
        prompt: '[AI] The `--prompt` option in the `man` command is used to customize the command-line prompt that appears before the man page output when you use the `man` command in a Unix or Linux terminal. By default, it displays the topic name of the man page and a greater than symbol (>). However, with the `--prompt` option, you can specify a custom string to be used as the prompt instead. For example, `man --prompt="My Custom Prompt >"` would display "My Custom Prompt >" before each man page output.'
        recode: '[AI] The `man --recode` command is used to reformat and recode Manpages (documentation files for Unix or Unix-like commands) using the `roff` markup language, specifically the `groff` formatter. The `--recode` option instructs `groff` to convert an existing Manpage file into a new format while preserving its original content and structure. This is often used to ensure consistency in the layout and presentation of Manpages across a system.'
        regex: '[AI] The `man --regex` command is not a valid flag in Unix or Linux environments. The `man` command is used to display the manual pages of other commands or programs. The `--regex` flag is not a recognized option for `man`. If you intended to use regular expressions in your `man` search query, use the `/` character followed by the regular expression pattern within the search query instead: `man -k /pattern`.'
        sections: '[AI] `man --sections` is a command-line option used with the man page utility in Unix-like operating systems. It allows users to display specific sections of the manual pages, instead of the entire page. Sections refer to logical groupings of commands and libraries in the man pages. Commonly used sections include 1 (User Commands), 2 (System Calls), 3 (C Library Functions), 4 (Device Files), 5 (File Formats), 6 ( Games), 7 (Miscellaneous). By using `man --sections`, you can quickly access the information you need without having to navigate through irrelevant sections.'
        systems: '[AI] The `man --sysadmin` or `man 7 systems` command is used in Unix-like operating systems to display information about system calls related to managing and administering the system, rather than user-space applications. These system calls are typically low-level and affect the kernel directly. This manual page section provides details on various topics like interprocess communication, file I/O, process management, and other system administration tasks.'
        troff: '[AI] `man --troff` is a command-line option used with the `man` page generator in Unix-like systems. The `--troff` option specifies that the generated output should be formatted using NROFF or TROFF typesetting system instead of the default plain text format. This allows for better formatting and typesetting of manual pages, producing more readable and visually appealing outputs.'
        troff-device: '[AI] The `--troff-device` flag in GNU `man` is used to specify the device or output format for the generated `nroff` or Troff output. It can take values like ''ascii'', ''postscript'', ''ps'', ''dvi'', ''pdf'', and others. For instance, `--troff-device=ps` generates PostScript output instead of the default terminal output. This option is useful when creating manual pages for printing or inclusion in other documents.'
        update: '[AI] `man --update` is not a command or a flag in and of itself in Unix or Linux systems. It''s actually an instruction for the `man` (short for manual) command to update its database of pages, which it retrieves from manpages.org by default. The `--update` option causes `man` to fetch new manpages and save them locally instead of displaying the existing help or man page.'
        usage: '[AI] The `--usage` option is not a flag itself, but rather a subcommand used with some Unix and GNU command line utilities such as `man` (short for "manual"). When you type `man --usage`, what you''re actually asking for is the usage information of the `man` command itself. This will display a brief description of how to use the man command, including valid options and arguments. In general, using `--usage` or the equivalent `-h` (help) option with various command line tools provides a quick way to learn about their functionality and syntax.'
        version: '[AI] The `man --version` command is used to display information about the Man page processor tool itself, rather than the manual pages of other commands or programs. It provides the version number and other relevant details about the Man page processor installed on your system.'
        warnings: '[AI] The `--warnings` flag in GNU `make` is used to control the handling of warnings produced during the build process. When this flag is set (for example, with `make --warnings`), Make will print each warning message to standard error as it encounters them, allowing the user to be aware of potential issues that might not prevent the build from completing successfully but could indicate incorrect or inefficient use of the makefile. The build process itself will continue uninterrupted unless a warning message is followed by an error (in which case the build would stop). This flag can help ensure that the build process runs as intended while keeping the user informed of potential issues.'
        whatis: |-
            [AI] The `man whatis` command is a part of Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It's used to display a list of commands and their brief descriptions (also known as synopses) stored in the system's "whatis" database.

            When you type `man whatis` in your terminal, it won't show you documentation for 'whatis' itself, but rather a list of available commands along with their short descriptions. This can be helpful when you forget the name of a command or need a quick reminder of its usage.

            To see information about a specific command, use `whatis [command-name]`. For example: `whatis grep` will display the synopsis for 'grep'.
        where: |-
            [AI] The `man --where` command is not a valid or recognized flag in Unix-like operating systems, including GNU and BSD variants. It seems like you might have meant to ask about using the `man` command with the `--where-named` option instead.

            The `man --where-named <pattern>` command is used to search for manual pages that contain a specific string or pattern in their titles, synopses, or sections. For example, if you run `man --where-named 'ssh'`, the system will display the path of the manual page file associated with the `ssh` command, assuming it exists on your system.
        where-cat: '[AI] The `man --where-cat` command is not a valid command in Unix or Linux systems. The `man` command is a utility used to read the manual pages of other commands, while `--where-cat` is not a recognized option for it. If you meant to use another command with an option named `--where-cat`, please provide the correct command name for proper explanation.'
        wildcard: '[AI] `man --wildcard` is not a command or a flag itself, but rather an option that can be used with the `man` command in Unix-like operating systems. The `--wildcard` option enables the interpretation of question marks (?) and asterisks (*) in the argument given to the `man` command as wildcards, allowing the display of man pages for commands or topics matching those patterns. For instance, `man --wildcard cp*` would show man pages for ''cp'', ''cpio'', ''cpp'', etc. This can be useful when you''re unsure about the exact name of a man page you''re looking for.'
