documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux kill-session` command is used to terminate a running TMUX session. It takes either a session ID or the name of the session as an argument, and sends the SIGTERM signal to that session, attempting to gracefully shut it down. If the session does not exit after receiving the SIGTERM signal, `tmux kill-session` can be used with the `-k` flag to send the SIGKILL signal instead, forcing the termination of the session.'
    flag:
        C: '[AI] The `tmux kill-session` command with the `-C` flag is used to send a signal to a Tamux server process, asking it to terminate all the sessions attached to it. The `-C` option stands for "detach-only", which means that only sessions in detached mode will be killed. This can be useful when you want to terminate all background sessions cleanly before shutting down a server or log out of a remote machine.'
        a: '[AI] The `tmux kill-session` command is used to terminate one or all sessions in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. The `-a` flag stands for "all," meaning this command will terminate all active sessions when invoked. This can be useful during system shutdowns, emergency situations, or when wanting to close multiple sessions at once. Remember that using `kill-session -a` will not delete the session configuration files, which will retain your window layouts and other settings for future use.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux kill-session` command with the `-t` option is used to terminate a named tmux session. The argument after `-t` specifies the name or ID of the session to be killed. When you run this command, tmux sends a SIGTERM signal to all processes in the session, giving them a chance to gracefully shut down. If the session does not terminate after a reasonable amount of time, tmux sends a SIGKILL signal to forcefully end the session. This command is useful when you want to terminate a long-running tmux session from another terminal window or session.'
