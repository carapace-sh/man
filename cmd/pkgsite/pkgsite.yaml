documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pkgsite` is a command-line utility often used in package managers like NPM (Node Package Manager) or Yarn, which generates and serves a static website for showcasing package information. This includes details such as description, version history, dependencies, and more. It''s helpful for maintaining documentation and allowing users to easily browse available packages.'
    flag:
        cache: '[AI] `pkgsite-cache` is a directory used by the `pkgsite` tool in Debian and other Debian-based distributions to store pre-built HTML pages of package lists generated from `apt-get dh_mapfiles --with-cpio`. The flag `--generate-debhelper-docs` when used with `apt-get build-dep` or `dpkg-buildpackage` will trigger the generation of these pages, which are then served by a web server like `apache2` through the `pkgsite` tool. This allows for easy and fast access to package lists, saving bandwidth and time during software installation.'
        cachedir: '[AI] The `pkgsite --cachedir` flag in NuGet, a popular package manager for .NET projects, specifies the local directory where NuGet stores its cached packages before installing them. This flag is useful when working with large solutions or teams with slow internet connections to improve build performance by reducing network traffic and the time spent on downloading packages multiple times.'
        dev: '[AI] `pkgsite-dev` is a flag used in some software packaging systems, such as NPM (Node Package Manager) or Homebrew. This flag indicates that the installation or build process should include development dependencies or packages that are not required for production use but necessary for developing and testing the software. These additional packages can include development libraries, frameworks, test suites, and other tools. Using `pkgsite-dev` ensures that the entire development environment is set up correctly.'
        gopath_mode: |-
            [AI] The `-gopath_mode` flag in Go's `pkgsite` tool is used to set the mode for specifying the Go workspace path (GOPATH) when building a package for generating package documentation.

            In normal GOPATH mode, each Go installation has its own default GOPATH set in the environment variable `$GOPATH`. Each project can have its own local GOPATH within its directory structure by setting the `GOPATH` environment variable locally or using a `go.mod` file to manage dependencies.

            The `-gopath_mode` flag allows overriding this behavior and specifying an absolute or relative path as an argument instead of relying on the GOPATH environment variables. This can be useful when building package documentation in CI environments where setting up and managing multiple GOPATHs might not be feasible or desired.
        gorepo: '[AI] `pkgsite-gorepo` is a custom flag used in Go, specifically with the go get and go install commands. It instructs Go to fetch not just the main module''s dependencies but also all dependencies of those dependencies recursively from the specified Go repository, making it an effective way to update an entire Go project tree that uses multiple repositories.'
        http: '[AI] The "pkgsite -http" flag is used in the context of software package management systems, such as apt or yum, to configure them to communicate with a remote package repository over HTTP protocol. The repository can be located on a different machine or server and contains packages that are not available in the local system''s default repositories. By using this flag, the package manager is able to fetch and install these additional packages from the specified HTTP repository.'
        list: '[AI] `pkgsite -list` is a command used in some package management systems, like Npm or Yarn, which lists all installed packages along with their versions and other relevant information. It allows users to easily view and manage the packages they have installed, helping with version tracking, upgrades, and dependency management.'
        open: '[AI] `pkgsite -open` is a command used in NPM (Node Package Manager) registry to open a specific package site page. The flag `-open` instructs the command to open the URL of that package site in a web browser after it has been displayed in the terminal. It''s often used for conveniently accessing detailed information about a particular NPM package directly from the command line interface.'
        proxy: '[AI] The `pkgsite -proxy` flag is used with the PakSite package repository manager for Debian-based Linux distributions. It sets up the tool to use a proxy server while downloading packages and updates from the repository. This can be useful in environments where internet access is restricted or slow, as the proxy server acts as an intermediary between the client and the remote repositories, improving performance or allowing access behind firewalls or proxies.'
        static: '[AI] `pkgsite-static` is a static file generation flag used in npm (Node Package Manager) packages. It triggers the creation of a `dist` directory containing only static files, without executing any JavaScript code or building dynamic components during the build process. This approach is suitable for serving websites directly from a package, as it reduces the server-side requirements and allows for simpler hosting solutions.'
