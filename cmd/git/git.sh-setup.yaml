    command: '[AI] The command `git sh-setup` is not a standard Git command. It seems to be a typo or misunderstanding of other Git commands such as `git shell-setup`, which sets up the terminal environment for better integration with Git. This command allows you to use Git specific features like colorized output and autocompletion within your terminal. However, this setup is usually done once during installation or initial configuration and does not require running it as a separate command.'
