    command: '[AI] "Fury sharing" is a strategy in World of Warcraft (WoW) where players gather Fury, a resource used by certain classes such as Rogues and Warriors, and then share it with other members of their group or raid through various means, like consumables or abilities. This allows for more efficient use of the Fury-generating abilities and can lead to increased damage output and better performance in group content.'
