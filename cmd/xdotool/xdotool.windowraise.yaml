documentation:
    command: |-
        [AI] `xdotool windowraise` is a command-line utility for interacting with the X Window System's graphical user interface. The `windowraise` subcommand raises the specified window to the top of the stack, making it active and bringing it to the front of all other windows. This can be useful in automation scripts or for quickly switching between applications. To use it, you need to provide the ID or title of the target window as an argument, which can be obtained using other `xdotool` commands like `search` or `focusget`. For example:

        ```bash
        xdotool search --name "Google Chrome" windowraise
        ```

        This command raises the Google Chrome window if it's currently open.
