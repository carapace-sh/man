    command: '[AI] `terraform login` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Terraform tool to authenticate a workstation with the Terraform Cloud or Atlas registry. It allows you to securely manage your infrastructure as code by storing your state files in the cloud and collaborating with team members. When you run `terraform login`, it opens a web browser to prompt you for signing in to your account, or if you prefer, it provides an access token that can be copied and pasted into Terraform configuration files for automated workflows. After successful authentication, Terraform configures your local CLI to interact with your registry, enabling you to manage resources across multiple workspaces and teams.'
