When Waypoint runs with this option set, it sends its collected telemetry data to the specified distributed tracing system, enabling users to have end-to-end visibility into their application''s performance and behavior.'
        telemetry-oc-agent-addr: '[AI] The command `flag "waypoint server run" --telemetry-oc-agent-addr` is used to configure the address of the OpenTelemetry Collector Agent in Waypoint, an open-source observability system by Google. Waypoint is responsible for building, configuring, and deploying your applications. The collector agent is a component that gathers telemetry data (metrics, traces, and logs) from your application and sends it to a backend observability platform for analysis and visualization. By setting the `--telemetry-oc-agent-addr` flag, you specify the address of the collector agent, enabling Waypoint to send the collected data to the correct location.'
        telemetry-oc-agent-insecure: '[AI] The command `flag "waypoint server run --telemetry-oc-agent-insecure"` is used to start Waypoint Server with the `--telemetry-oc-agent-insecure` flag enabled. Waypoint is an open-source project developed by Microsoft for building and deploying Kubernetes applications at scale. The `--telemetry-oc-agent-insecure` flag allows Waypoint to communicate with OpenTelemetry Collector agents using an insecure connection. This can be useful in environments where securing communications between components may not be a priority, but it is generally recommended to use secure communication channels whenever possible for improved security and data privacy.'
        telemetry-oc-zpages-addr: |-
            [AI] The command `waypoint server run --telemetry-oc-zpages-addr` is used to start a Waypoint server with telemetry data forwarded to an OpenTelemetry Collector running on a specific Zpages address. Here's a breakdown of the components:

            1. `waypoint server run`: This starts the Waypoint server, which is an open-source tool for managing and deploying applications across various environments.
            2. `--telemetry-oc-zpages-addr`: This flag enables telemetry data forwarding to an OpenTelemetry Collector running at a specific Zpages address (a custom endpoint used by OpenTelemetry). The collector is responsible for aggregating, processing, and exporting the collected telemetry data to various backends such as Elasticsearch, Prometheus, or Jaeger.
        tls-cert-file: '[AI] The `--tls-cert-file` flag in the `waypoint server run` command is used to specify the file path of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) certification file for securing the Waypoint server communication with clients and other servers using SSL/TLS encryption. This flag ensures that data transmitted between clients and the server are encrypted, adding an additional layer of security.'
        tls-key-file: '[AI] The `--tls-key-file` flag for the `waypoint server run` command relates to Transport Layer Security (TLS) configuration for the Waypoint server. When used, this flag specifies the file path of a private key used in conjunction with a TLS certificate for securing communications between clients and the Waypoint server over HTTPS. By providing this flag, Waypoint enforces secure connections when starting or managing servers using the Waypoint CLI.'
        url-api-addr: '[AI] The command `waypoint server run --url-api-addr` is used to start a Waypoint server, which is an open-source multi-cloud application delivery controller. The `--url-api-addr` flag specifies the URL for the API server address where Waypoint will communicate with it to manage applications and services. Once started, Waypoint automates the deployment and management of applications across different environments, such as development, staging, or production clusters, by using declarative configuration files called HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) files.'
        url-api-insecure: '[AI] The command `waypoint server run --url-api-insecure` is used to start a Waypoint server with an insecure API. Waypoint is an open-source tool for managing Kubernetes applications. This command starts the Waypoint server with its API accessible over an unsecured network connection, which should only be used in development or testing environments where security is not a primary concern due to the potential risks of exposing the API without encryption.'
        url-auto-app-hostname: |-
            [AI] The command `waypoint server run --url-auto-app-hostname` is used in Hashicorp's Waypoint configuration management tool to start a local development server with automatically generated URLs for running applications.

            When you run this command, Waypoint sets up a local development environment by creating an application server and registering it with the Waypoint agent. The `--url-auto-app-hostname` option causes Waypoint to automatically assign a unique hostname (in the format `<random_string>.local`) to each new application that is deployed to this server, making it easier to access the app via its generated URL.

            So in summary, this command sets up a local development server and generates unique hostnames for each application running on it.
        url-control-addr: '[AI] The `waypoint server run --url-control-addr` command is used to start the Waypoint server, which is a tool for managing and configuring Kubernetes applications. The `--url-control-addr` flag specifies the URL address where Waypoint''s control plane API can be accessed. When you run this command in your terminal or command prompt, it starts the Waypoint server with the specified control plane API URL. This allows other components to communicate with and manage the application configurations through Waypoint''s API.'
        url-control-token: '[AI] The `--url-control-token` option in the `waypoint server run` command is used to specify a token for controlling URL access to the Waypoint server. Waypoint is an open-source continuous delivery and infrastructure management tool by Google. This flag allows you to set a token that must be included in requests to certain API endpoints, adding an additional layer of security to your Waypoint setup.'
        url-enabled: '[AI] The `--url-enabled` flag for the "waypoint server run" command in Terraform is used to enable or disable the HTTP and HTTPS URLs of the Waypoint server. When this flag is set to true, the Waypoint server will start with URL endpoints enabled, allowing external access to the server''s API. If set to false, the URLs will be disabled, preventing external access. This can be useful for security reasons, as disabling the URLs can help prevent unauthorized access to your Terraform configuration data and other sensitive information.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint server run --workspace` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool to start a local development server from a specified workspace. This command starts Waypoint with the given workspace as its active configuration context, allowing you to test and iterate on your infrastructure definitions locally before deploying changes to production environments. The `--workspace` option specifies the name or path of the directory containing the desired Waypoint configuration files.'
