description: Run a runner for executing remote operations
flags:
    --enable-dynamic-config: Allow dynamic config to be created when an exec plugin is used.
    --id=: If this is set, the runner will use the specified id.
    --liveness-tcp-addr=: Open a TCP listener on this address when it is running.
    --odr: Indicates to the runner it's operating as an on-demand runner.
    --plain: Plain output
    -a, --app=: App to target.
    -p, --project=: Project to target.
    -w, --workspace=: Workspace to operate in.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "waypoint runner agent" is a component in the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework used for executing waypoints in a robot''s mission plan. Waypoints represent specific locations or tasks for the robot to navigate or accomplish, and the runner agent processes these waypoints sequentially, sending appropriate commands to the robot''s hardware to achieve each step in the mission. It facilitates seamless transition between different stages of the robot''s operation while ensuring efficient execution of the given task list.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The command `flag "waypoint-runner-agent" --app` is related to Waypoint, an open-source Kubernetes-native continuous delivery tool from Microsoft. This command is used to configure Waypoint''s "waypoint-runner-agent," which is a background process responsible for building and deploying applications when changes are detected. The `--app` flag indicates the specific application or service that will be managed by this agent.'
        enable-dynamic-config: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint runner agent --enable-dynamic-config"` is used in the context of Kubernetes'' Waypoint project. It enables the dynamic configuration feature for the Waypoint Runner Agent, allowing it to fetch and apply new configurations from a centralized source of truth periodically or on demand. This improves the manageability and automation of infrastructure and application deployments across multiple environments.'
        id: '[AI] The `waypoint runner agent --id` refers to a command used in Waypoint, an open-source fleet management solution for Docker containers. This command is used to identify or retrieve the ID of a running Waypoint agent. When you run `waypoint runner agent --id`, it returns the unique identifier assigned to the agent process in your system. This information can be useful when interacting with or managing specific agents within your Waypoint fleet.'
        liveness-tcp-addr: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint runner agent --liveness-tcp-addr"` is used to configure the Liveness probe TCP address in the Waypoint Runner Agent, which is a component of the Waypoint open-source platform for deploying and managing containerized applications. This flag specifies the IP address and port number where the external liveness probes should be sent from the Kubernetes cluster to check the agent''s health status. The default value is an empty string, indicating that no explicit Liveness probe TCP address is configured. When provided, it helps ensure the agent is running and responding as expected, which in turn, enables the overall application to maintain its desired state in the Kubernetes environment.'
        odr: '[AI] The command `waypoint run agent --odr` is used in HashiCorp''s Nomad and Waypoint tools. It launches an agent process with NameServer (NS) and worker (worker-local) roles within the Nomad cluster using Waypoint. The `--odr` flag stands for "one-shot daemon runner," which means that after running the command, Waypoint will exit and the launched agent processes will continue to run in the background. This is useful when you want to deploy or update an application without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.'
        plain: '[AI] The command `waypoint runner agent --plain` is used in Waypoint, an open-source multi-cloud application platform by Microsoft. This command starts the Waypoint Agent as a background process without any extra formatting or output decoration (the plain flag). It helps to keep logs and outputs simple and easy to read for users who prefer a more minimal display.'
        project: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint run agent --project` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source Kubernetes application delivery platform, to execute a specific task or workflow for a defined project. Here's a brief explanation of the components:

            1. `waypoint`: This is the command-line interface tool provided by Waypoint for interacting with its services and managing applications.
            2. `run`: This subcommand triggers the execution of a task or workflow, typically in the context of an application deployed using Waypoint.
            3. `agent`: This is the mode that indicates the command will be executed inside a Waypoint Agent container, allowing for local resource access and automation.
            4. `--project`: This flag specifies the name or path of the project containing the configuration files and definitions for the task or workflow to be executed.
        workspace: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint runner agent --workspace"` is used in Waypoint, an open-source Kubernetes application deployment and management tool by Microsoft. This flag specifies the local directory or path to the workspace containing the application configuration files for Waypoint to manage. By providing this information, Waypoint can locate and process the necessary YAML files for deploying and managing applications on a Kubernetes cluster.'
