name: rebase [<id> | <branch>] [flags]
description: Automatically rebase the source_branch of the merge request against its target_branch.
flags:
    --skip-ci: Rebase merge request while skipping CI/CD pipeline.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `glab mr rebase` command is used with GitLab''s `glab` tool for interacting with GitLab Merge Requests (MRs) from the command line. This command fetches the latest state of the specified MR, then performs a fast-forward or interactive rebase based on the changes introduced in the MR, applying those changes to your local branch. The goal is to update your local branch with the changes from the MR and prepare it for merging back into the target branch.'
    flag:
        skip-ci: '[AI] The command `git rebase --skip-ci` with the `--glab` flag is used in Git to bypass commit messages checks during a rebasing process. This means that the `git rebase` command will not stop or pause when it encounters a commit message that fails the commit message hooks (also known as CI, Continuous Integration checks). By using this option, the rebasing process continues without waiting for these checks to be resolved. It''s important to note that this bypasses only the commit message checks and does not affect other types of validation rules or tests that might be in place.'
