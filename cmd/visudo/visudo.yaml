documentation:
    command: '[AI] `visudo` is a text-based editor used to configure the Suexec and sudo access rules in the Linux operating system. It provides a user-friendly interface for editing the sudoers file with syntax highlighting and error checking, ensuring proper formatting and validity of the file. This helps prevent potential misconfigurations or security vulnerabilities related to sudo access.'
    flag:
        check: '[AI] `visudo --check` is a command used with the Vim text editor to check the syntax and validity of sudoers configuration files. The `--check` option performs a parse-only check, meaning it reads the file but does not make any changes. It simply reports any errors or warnings that may be present in the configuration file. This is an important command for ensuring the security and proper functioning of the sudo access control system.'
        file: '[AI] The `visudo` command with the `--file` option is used to check the syntax and validity of a SuID (Set User ID) configured Visible File Editor (Vim or Nano) configuration file for the Linux visudo access control list (ACL) manager. The file in question is usually located at `/etc/visudo.conf`. By providing the file path instead of using `--file`, you can check a custom visudo configuration file. This command ensures that there are no errors before saving changes to maintain proper system security.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `visudo` is a text-based editor for managing Linux system file permissions and access rules, specifically the `/etc/sudoers` file. The `--help` option displays detailed usage information when running the `visudo` command. Here's a concise explanation:

            ```
            Usage: visudo [OPTIONS] [FILE]

            Options:
              -c, --check     check only, do not write file
              -f, --file=FILE  use given sudoers file instead of default
              -h, --help       display this help and exit
              -l, --list       list grants and exclude an editor
              -q, --quiet      suppress various informational messages
            ```

            The `visudo` command can be used with various options such as:

            - `--check`: Only check the current sudoers file for errors and security issues without making any changes.
            - `--file=FILE`: Use a different `/etc/sudoers` file instead of the default one.
            - `--help`: Display help information and exit.
            - `--list`: List the grants in the sudoers file without opening the editor.
            - `--quiet`: Suppress informational messages during usage.
        quiet: '[AI] The `visudo --quiet` command is used to check the syntax of a sudoers file without displaying any messages or prompts. It only returns an exit status indicating whether the file is valid (0) or contains errors (non-zero). This can be useful for scripts or automated processes that need to ensure the sudoers file is correctly formatted before continuing.'
        strict: '[AI] `visudo --strict` is a command used with the `vim` text editor to edit the system-wide SuDOers configuration file in a secure manner. The `--strict` option enforces strict parsing rules and syntax checking, helping to prevent potential security vulnerabilities or errors by ensuring that the file conforms to the correct format. It''s essential for maintaining the security of the system when making changes to the SuDOers file.'
        version: '[AI] `visudo --version` is a command used with the Visually Integrated SuDO editor (ViSUDO) to display the version information of the sudo utility and visudo configuration file editor installed on your system. The output will typically include the name of the software, its version number, and sometimes additional details such as the build date or operating system it''s running on.'
