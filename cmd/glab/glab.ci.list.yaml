documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `glab ci list` command is used in GitLab to list all available Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines for a specific branch or commit in a repository. It allows users to view the status and details of each pipeline run, including the pipeline name, status (success, failure, or pending), and the Ref ID (branch or commit hash) that triggered the pipeline. This command helps developers monitor the CI process, identify issues, and keep track of pipeline runs in their GitLab projects.'
    flag:
        orderBy: '[AI] `glab ci list --orderBy` is a command used in the Glab CI tool to list available GitHub Actions workflows in a repository, but it sorts the output based on the specified order. The `--orderBy` option accepts values like "created", "updated" or "alphabetical" which determine the sorting criteria for the workflow files displayed in the output.'

            [AI] `glab ci list --page` is a command used in GitLab's CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, Glab. It lists the continuous integration (CI) jobs that are available for an specific project or branch. The `--page` option is used to navigate through multiple pages of results when dealing with large numbers of jobs.

            For example, if there are more CI jobs than can be displayed on a single page, you can use `glab ci list --page 2` to view the second page of results. This command helps in managing and monitoring large-scale GitLab CI environments efficiently.
        per-page: '[AI] `glab ci list --per-page` is a command used in GitLab to list continuous integration (CI) jobs. The `--per-page` option sets the number of jobs to be displayed per page. For instance, `glab ci list --per-page 10` will return the details of the last 10 CI jobs in your project. This command helps to navigate through large numbers of CI runs efficiently, especially when dealing with extensive development pipelines.'
        sort: '[AI] `glab ci list --sort` is a command used in the Glab tool, which is a Git interface for GitLab. This specific command lists all the continuous integration (CI) pipelines or jobs in the current GitLab project. The `--sort` option sorts the output based on a given key, by default it sorts in ascending order based on the pipeline or job creation time.'
        status: '[AI] `glab ci list --status` is a command used in GitLab to list all continuous integration (CI) jobs or pipelines and display their current statuses. The `--status` option filters the output to only show the job names, their status (such as "success", "failure", "pending", or "skipped"), and other related information like start and end times. This command provides a quick overview of the current state of the CI jobs in your GitLab project.'
