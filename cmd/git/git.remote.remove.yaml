description: Remove a remote
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git remote remove` is a Git command used to delete a remote repository that was previously added to your local Git repository using `git remote add`. This command takes the name of the remote as its argument and removes the link between your local repository and the remote, effectively disconnecting it. It''s important to note that deleting a remote repository does not affect the data on the server; it only modifies the local Git configuration.'
