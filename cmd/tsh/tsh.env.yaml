documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tsh env` command is used in the Turbostat hardware monitoring tool to display the current environment variables set for the running jobs or processes on a Turbine cluster. It provides information about key-value pairs of the environment variables, which can be useful for debugging and understanding the context of the running tasks.'
    flag:
        format: |-
            [AI] `tsh` is the Tmux shell, a terminal multiplexer for Unix and Unix-like systems. The `env` command in Tmux is used to list all the current environment variables. The option `--format` allows customizing the output format of the command.

            So, `tsh env --format` would return an output that displays all the current environment variables in Tmux shell's format. By default, it would display them as key-value pairs, but you could use various formats to change how they are displayed using the `--format` option.
        no-unset: '[AI] `tsh` is the Tenable Security Hardening Tool, a CLI utility used to configure and manage security settings in Tenable products. The command `tsh env --no-unset` retrieves all environment variables with values set, excluding any unset (empty) variables from the output. This allows users to view only the defined environment variables.'
        unset: '[AI] `tsh` is a Unix-style shell, and the command `tsh env --unset` is used to unset (remove) an environment variable from the current shell session. The `--unset` option specifies that you only want to remove the variable, without setting any other value. For example, if you have an environment variable named `MY_VAR` with the value `"hello"`, running `tsh env --unset MY_VAR` would remove the variable so that it no longer exists in the current shell session.'
