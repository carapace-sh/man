    command: '[AI] `flatpak info` is a command used in the Flatpak packaging system to display detailed information about installed or available Flatpak applications or runtimes. It shows metadata such as the application''s name, version, vendor, dependencies, and size. By default, it displays information for the currently running application or the one specified if provided as an argument. This command helps in checking the details of installed Flatpak apps for troubleshooting, updates or just for reference.'
    flag:
        arch: '[AI] `flatpak info` is a command-line utility for querying information about Flatpak applications and runtimes. The option `--arch` is used to display the architecture of the Flatpak application or runtime. This can be useful for checking if an application is built for the same architecture as your system, ensuring compatibility. For example, `flatpak info --arch <application>` will output something like "x86\_64" or "armv7l" indicating the supported architecture.'
        file-access: '[AI] `flatpak info` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The `--file-access` option that can be passed to this command displays the file accesses of a Flatpak application. It lists the files and directories that the application is allowed to read or write in the host system, along with the permission types (read, write, or execute). This information can be used for security analysis and understanding the impact of an application on the system.'
        help: '[AI] `flatpak info` is a command-line utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and package management system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

        installation: '[AI] `flatpak info --installation` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to display detailed information about installed Flatpak applications and their runtimes, including their locations, versions, and dependencies. It provides a comprehensive overview of the installation state for each Flatpak application on your system.'
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak info` is a command-line utility for the Flatpak application packaging system. The `--ostree-verbose` option is used to display detailed information about the OSTree checksums and manifests associated with the installed Flatpak application. This includes the tree-hash, manifest-digest, and other metadata that ensure the integrity of the installed software.'
        show-commit: '[AI] `flatpak info` is a command-line utility for querying information about Flatpak applications and their runtimes. The `--show-commit` option specifically displays the commit hash of the running application or runtime. This commit hash identifies the exact version and revision of the software in use, providing important details for debugging and tracking changes.'
        show-extensions: |-
            [AI] `flatpak info` is a command-line utility used to query information about Flatpak applications and extensions installed on a system. The `--show-extensions` option specifically requests output related to the installed extensions.

            The result includes the extension's name, ID, version, branch, and active status. Additionally, it shows the application providing the extension, and any dependent extensions that may be required for proper functionality.

            For example:
            ```css
            $ flatpak info --show-extensions org.example.extension
            Extension 'org.example.extension' in branch 'stable' for application 'org.example.application'
              Version: 1.2.3
              Active: yes
              Depends on:
                Extension 'org.dependant.extension' (from 'org.dependent.application') = 1.1.0
            ```
            This shows the extension name, its ID, version number, active status, and any dependencies it may have on other extensions or applications.
        show-location: '[AI] `flatpak info` is a command-line utility for the Flatpak application packaging system. The `--show-location` option asks it to display the location of the given Flatpak application''s files, including its binary executable and data files. This can be useful for debugging or understanding where a specific application''s components are located within the system.'
        show-metadata: '[AI] `flatpak info` is a command-line utility for interacting with Flatpak applications and runtimes. The `--show-metadata` option requests that it displays the metadata of the selected application or runtime. This metadata includes details such as its name, description, version, dependencies, and other relevant information. It''s commonly used by developers and system administrators to gain insight into the installed Flatpak software, check for updates, or troubleshoot issues.'
        show-origin: '[AI] `flatpak info` is a command-line utility for the Flatpak application packaging system. The `--show-origin` option when used with this command displays detailed information about the origin of a Flatpak application, including its builder, build history, and the branch or commit that was used to build the application package. This information can be useful in understanding the provenance and versioning of installed applications, as well as for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.'
        show-permissions: '[AI] The `flatpak info` command is a utility provided by Flatpak, a software deployment platform. The `--show-permissions` option displays the permissions granted to a specific Flatpak application or runtime. These permissions represent the access rights that the application requires to function properly and interact with the system. The output includes details such as file system paths, network connections, and capabilities like access to the microphone or camera. Understanding an application''s permissions can help you manage its behavior on your system more effectively and ensure privacy concerns are addressed.'
        show-ref: |-
            [AI] `flatpak info` is a command-line utility for the Flatpak software deployment platform. The `--show-ref` option is used to display the ref (short for reference) of a Flatpak application or runtime.

            A Flatpak ref is a unique identifier that specifies the exact version and branch of a particular build of an application or runtime. It includes information about the branch name, the commit hash, and the repository where the build was published. The ref allows you to precisely pin down the desired version of an application or runtime for your system, ensuring reproducibility and consistency.
