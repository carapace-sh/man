    command: '[AI] `tmux run-shell` is a TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) command used to execute a single shell command within an existing TMUX session. The command is typically followed by the shell command in quotes, for example: `tmux send-keys -t <session>:<window>.0 "ls" C-m`. When executed, this command sends the `ls` command to the specified window of the given TMUX session and then presses the Enter key to run it. The output is displayed in the terminal without leaving the TMUX environment.'
    flag:
        C: '[AI] `tmux run-shell` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that opens a new pane or window running an interactive shell. The `-C` option stands for "command-substitution." With this option, the output of the command run in the new shell is captured and returned to the calling environment as a string. Therefore, `tmux run-shell -C` creates a new shell process, runs the given command inside it, and returns its output back to Tmux or the parent shell.'
        b: '[AI] `tmux run-shell -b` is a command in Tmux (Terminal Multiplexer), a terminal session manager, used to execute a shell command in the background of a Tmux pane or session. The `-b` flag stands for "background" mode, meaning that once the command finishes executing, it will detach from the terminal and run in the background, freeing up your Tmux session for other tasks.'
        d: '[AI] `tmux run-shell -d` is a command in Tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) that creates a new detached session and runs a shell command inside it. The "-d" option stands for "detach" mode, which means the session will be detached from the terminal and run in the background. Once started, you can reattach to the session later using `tmux attach`. This command is useful for running long-running processes or scripts in the background without keeping a terminal window open.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux run-shell -t` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to create a new session and run a shell command inside it in the background. The `-t` option specifies a name or an index for the new session tab. When executed, `tmux run-shell -t <session_name>` creates a new session with that name, if it doesn''t exist, and runs the shell command within it. It returns the ID of the created session. If the session already exists, it just runs the command inside the existing session.'
