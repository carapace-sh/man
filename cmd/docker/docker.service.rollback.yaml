name: rollback [OPTIONS] SERVICE
description: Revert changes to a service's configuration
flags:
    -d, --detach: Exit immediately instead of waiting for the service to converge
    -q, --quiet: Suppress progress output
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker service rollback` is a command used in Docker Swarm to revert the latest change made on a specific service. It allows you to go back to the previous version or configuration of a running service. The command takes the name of the service as an argument and optionally, the revision number of the service you want to rollback to. For example: `docker service rollback myservice <revision>`. This command is helpful when you need to undo changes that caused issues or errors in your running services without having to recreate or redeploy them completely.'
    flag:
        detach: '[AI] `docker service rollback` is a command used in Docker Swarm to revert a specific version of a running service to an earlier snapshot. The `--detach` option detaches the container from its current network and consoles output, allowing it to run in the background. When using `rollback --detach`, the new container will be created and started with the rolled-back configuration, but you won''t see any console output during the process unless you use additional tools like `docker logs`.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `docker service rollback` command is used to revert a Docker Swarm service to an earlier revision. The `--quiet` flag option is for suppressing output of progress indicators and status messages during the rollback process. Essentially, it runs the rollback operation in the background without displaying detailed logs or intermediate status updates.'
