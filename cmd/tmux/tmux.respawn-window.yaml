    command: '[AI] The `tmux respawn-window` command in TMUX, the terminal multiplexer, is used to automatically restart a window with its previous contents when it is detached or terminated. This can be particularly useful for applications that may crash or exit unexpectedly, as the next time you reattach to the session, the window will be recreated and its previous state will be restored. The command typically takes the form `tmux respawn-window [-S session_name | -t window_id]`, where `session_name` is the name of your TMUX session or `window_id` is the identifier of a specific window within that session.'
    flag:
        c: '[AI] `tmux respawn-window` is a command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, used to restart a specific window. The `-c` option specifies the target window by its index or name. With `respawn-window`, TMUX will automatically restart any processes that were running in the window when it was detached or lost connection. This is useful for keeping long-running processes alive across sessions, such as background jobs or screen-sharing applications.'
        e: '[AI] `tmux respawn-window` is a command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, used to automatically restart a window that has stopped or crashed. The `-e` option specifies the command to execute inside the new instance of the window. For example, `tmux respawn-window -e ''bash /path/to/script.sh''` will create a new instance of the window and run the script located at "/path/to/script.sh" in it upon respawn.'
        k: '[AI] The `tmux` command `respawn-window -k` is used to automatically restart a window that has been closed unintentionally due to a terminated process or a SIGHUP signal in the terminal session managed by TMUX. The `-k` option specifies the key binding for triggering this action, allowing you to easily bring back running processes when needed.'
        t: |-
            [AI] The `tmux` command `respawn-window -t <session-name>` is used to automatically restart a window inside a `tmux` session when it exits due to an error or termination of a process running in that window.

            The `-t` option followed by `<session-name>` specifies the name or index of the session and window you want to configure for autorespawning. When a window with this name is closed, `tmux` will automatically start a new instance of the command or process that was previously running in that window.

            This can be particularly useful when working with long-running processes or tasks, ensuring that they always remain active and continue executing even if they are accidentally terminated.
