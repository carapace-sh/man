    command: '[AI] The `inshellisense bind` command is used in PowerShell to create or modify keybindings for the IntelliSense feature. It takes two parameters: the first is the key combination (a string in the format `<KeyModifier>+<Key>`), and the second is the script block or cmdlet that will be executed when that keybinding is pressed. For example, `New-HostBinding -Name MyBinding -KeyCombination "Ctrl + Shift + M" -Command { Write-Host "Hello, World!" }`. This command sets a custom binding for "Ctrl+Shift+M" to display the message "Hello, World!" in the PowerShell console.'
