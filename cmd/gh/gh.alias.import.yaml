documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh alias import` is a GitHub CLI (gh) command used to import aliases from a file or another GitHub account into your local gh configuration. This can be helpful when you want to adopt frequently used aliases from other users or projects, making it easier and more consistent to navigate your GitHub workflows.'
    flag:
        clobber: |-
            [AI] The `gh alias import --clobber` command in GitHub's `gh` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to replace any existing local Git alias with a new one that may exist remotely. The `--clobber` flag is optional but indicates that the existing alias should be forcefully replaced without prompting for confirmation.

            In other words, it imports an alias definition from a remote repository overwriting any existing aliases of the same name in your local Git configuration. It's useful when you want to ensure that your Git aliases match those of a specific remote repository, such as a project's main repository.
