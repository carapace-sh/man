documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `unexpand` command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems is used to reverse the effect of text expansion, particularly the shell''s history expansion or tab completion. It removes sequences of characters that have been replaced by a single character or word due to these features, restoring the original text. For instance, if you have used tab completion to fill in a filename but want to see the actual sequence of characters you typed before using tab, you can use `unexpand` to display them.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] The `unexpand --all` command in Unix is used to reverse the effect of text expansion, or tab completion, in a terminal session. When you press the Tab key while typing a command or file name, your shell expands it based on previously entered commands or filenames. The `unexpand --all` command removes all such expansions from the entire line, effectively disabling tab completion and restoring the original text. It''s often used when you want to copy-paste a command or path that contains expanded tabs without having them interpreted by your shell.'
        first-only: '[AI] `unexpand` is a text filtering command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The `--first-only` option is used with this command to only process and expand the first occurrence of each run of tabs or spaces in an input stream, leaving other instances of tabs or spaces in the original format. This can be useful when dealing with files that may have mixed tabulations, but only require some of them to be expanded for further processing.'
        help: '[AI] `unexpand` is a text filtering utility in Unix-like operating systems. The `--help` option when used with the `unexpand` command displays detailed help information about the command, including its usage syntax and available options. This helps users understand how to use the command effectively for tasks like expanding tabs to spaces or vice versa.'
        tabs: '[AI] The `unexpand --tabs` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to expand tabs in text files into spaces, specifically replacing each tab character with a certain number of spaces. By default, it uses 8 spaces per tab, but this can be changed using the `-i` or `--width` option followed by the desired number of spaces. This command is often used when text edited with a tab setting different from that of the target environment needs to be processed correctly in that environment, such as in scripting files or configuration files.'
        version: '[AI] `unexpand` is a text filtering utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The command `unexpand --version` is used to display the version information of the `unexpand` tool installed on the system. This includes details such as the name, version number, and sometimes additional information like the release date or the author of the software.'
