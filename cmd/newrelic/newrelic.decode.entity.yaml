This includes details on the HTTP request and response, database queries, external services calls, and more. The command is typically used interactively within the New Relic UI or programmatically through the Explore API for deeper analysis of performance issues.'

A trace entity represents a specific operation or a piece of work done by an application or service during a single request or RPC call. The `--key` option specifies the name of the entity key whose metadata is to be decoded. The output of this command provides detailed information about the requested entity, including its type, version, and any additional attributes or properties that may be associated with it.'
