documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `AGG` function or command in SQL is used for performing aggregation operations on a dataset, such as calculating the minimum, maximum, average, sum, or count of values in a column. It returns a single value or a set of values based on the specified aggregation function(s) applied to the input data. Commonly used aggregation functions are `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `SUM`, and `COUNT`. The syntax generally follows this pattern: `SELECT aggregation_function(column_name) FROM table_name GROUP BY grouping_expression;`'
    flag:
        cols: '[AI] `agg` is a command in Git that performs aggregation operations on the data in a Git repository. The `--cols` option is used to specify which columns of the output should be aggregated. It takes a comma-separated list of column indices or names. For example, `agg --cols 1,3` would aggregate the data from the first and third columns of the output.'
        font-dir: '[AI] The `ag` (Silver Searcher) command with the option `--font-dir` is used to specify a custom directory containing font files for use in rendering non-ASCII characters during text search. This option allows users to have more control over the appearance of characters when searching through text files, especially when dealing with non-standard character sets or encoding issues. By providing a directory path, `ag` will look for and use the specified font files to display characters correctly in its output.'
        font-family: '[AI] The `ag` (Silver Searcher) command with the option `--font-family` is used to configure the font family for the output of search results. This option allows users to specify a particular font family name that best suits their preferences, ensuring a clear and readable display when working with large or complex data sets. For instance, `ag --font-family "Monaco"` will apply the Monaco font family to the search result output.'
        font-size: '[AI] `agg --font-size` is a command-line option for the Aggragator (Agg) tool, which is part of the Graphviz software suite. This option sets the font size used in the output graphs. The value following `--font-size` specifies the point size, with a larger number resulting in a larger font. For example, `agg --font-size 12` sets the font size to 12 points.'
        fps-cap: '[AI] `agg --fps-cap` is a command-line option for the Agg library in MetaPost language, which is used to generate PostScript or PDF output from MetaPost code. This specific option sets a frame rate limit for animated MetaPost files, capping the number of frames per second (FPS) at the specified value. It helps ensure consistent and smooth playback of animations across different systems.'
        help: '[AI] `agg --help` is a command used in Apache Spark''s DataFrame API (Aggregation functions). It displays help information about various aggregation functions that can be applied to DataFrames using the `agg()` function. These functions include `count()`, `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`, `avg()`, and others, along with their respective syntax and usage examples.'
        idle-time-limit: '[AI] The `--idle-time-limit` flag in MySQL''s `mysqld` server is used to configure the maximum time a client can remain idle before being disconnected. If set, this option overrides the global `wait_timeout` system variable. It takes an integer value representing the number of seconds and helps in managing long-running queries or idling clients that consume resources without generating any output. When a client exceeds the specified idle time limit, MySQL terminates the connection to free up server resources.'
        line-height: '[AI] The `agg` command in Awk is used for aggregating and processing data in a streaming fashion. The option `--line-height` sets the height of each output line in rows, which can be useful when dealing with fixed-width columns or formatting output to fit within specific spaces. This allows for better control over the layout and presentation of the output.'
        no-loop: '[AI] `agg` is a command in SQL and Oracle databases used for performing aggregate functions on a dataset. The `--no-loop` option is a flag used when calling `agg` from a PL/SQL block or script. It disables the automatic looping feature of `agg`. In other words, it prevents `agg` from automatically iterating through the input cursor and performing the aggregation for each row. Instead, you must manually call `AGGREGATE.NEW_AGG()` function to initialize and update the aggregated values in your PL/SQL variables.'
        renderer: '[AI] `agg` is a data visualization and reporting toolkit, primarily used in Unix environments for generating complex graphs and charts from text-based data. The `--renderer` option specifies which backend renderer to use when generating the final output. Commonly used renderers include `ps`, `pdf`, `png`, and `svg`. For instance, if you want to generate a PNG image using agg, you would use the command `agg input_file.txt output.png --renderer png`.'
        rows: |-
            [AI] The `agg` command in SQL is used for performing aggregate functions on a dataset. The `--rows` option is not a flag specific to `agg`, but rather an option for the output format of the query results.

            When using `agg --rows`, the output will be displayed as a single row per group, showing the aggregated values in columns instead of the default behavior which displays one column per aggregate function with multiple rows representing each distinct group value. This format allows easier comparison and side-by-side analysis of the aggregated data for different groups.
        speed: '[AI] The `agg --speed` command is used in SQL databases, specifically with tools like MySQL or PostgreSQL, to aggregate data and calculate statistics such as minimum, maximum, average, sum, and count for a given column or set of columns. The `--speed` option is specific to the `agg` command in some database tools like psql (PostgreSQL''s command-line client), which enables the use of parallel processing to speed up the aggregation process on large datasets. This can significantly reduce the time required for complex queries, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and reporting tasks.'
        theme: '[AI] `agg` is a command-line tool for plotting and creating statistical graphics in a Unix environment, such as GNU Plot or R. The option `--theme` is used to apply a specific theme or appearance to the plots generated by `agg`. It allows customizing various aspects of the plot''s look and feel, like colors, fonts, line styles, and grid settings. Providing a specific theme file with this option, e.g., `--theme=my_custom_theme.theme`, will apply that custom theme when creating plots.'
        verbose: '[AI] `agg --verbose` is a command in PostgreSQL used with the `agg` (Aggregate) function to increase the verbosity of output. When executed, it will print detailed information about each aggregation operation performed in a query, including intermediate results and the final aggregated value. This can be useful for debugging complex queries or understanding the behavior of aggregate functions.'
        version: '[AI] `agg --version` is a command used in AWK data processing language to display the version information of the installed agg (GNU AWK Extension) library. It provides no other functionality; its sole purpose is to output the version number, compilation options, and other relevant details about the installed library.'
