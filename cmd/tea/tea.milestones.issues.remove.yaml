        [AI] The `tea milestones issues remove` command is used in the GitLab Terminal (`tea`) to remove issues that are no longer associated with a specific milestone in a GitLab project. This command helps keep the milestone and its associated issues list up-to-date by removing any stale references.

        Here's a brief explanation of how it works:

        1. `tea`: It is the name of the terminal interface for interacting with GitLab using the command line.
        2. `milestones`: This specifies that we will be working with milestones within a project.
        3. `issues`: This specifies that we will be dealing with issues, which are tracked tasks or bugs in a project.
        4. `remove`: This is the action we want to perform - removing issues from a specified milestone.

        When you run this command followed by the ID of the milestone and issue numbers (for example, `tea milestones issues remove 123 456`), GitLab will delete the association between the issues with the given IDs and the milestone with the specified ID. This can be useful when you've completed a milestone and no longer need certain issues linked to it or if you want to reorganize your project's issue tracking system.

        login: '[AI] The command `tea milestones issues remove --login` is a command used in Trello''s CLI tool, `tea`. This command removes all issues (cards representing tasks or bugs) with the "milestone" label from the currently logged-in board, and logs into Trello before executing if not already logged in.'
        output: '[AI] The `--tea-milestones-issues-remove` option is used with the Jenkins CLI (Command Line Interface) plugin when interacting with the Jenkins server''s programmatic interface. This command removes the specified issues from a specific Jenkins pipeline''s Tea Milestone. A "Tea Milestone" refers to a feature or set of features that are released together in Agile development methodologies, often represented visually as a timeline with milestones denoted as horizontal lines. The `--output` option specifies the desired output format for the command''s result.'
        remote: |-
            [AI] The `--tea-milestones issues remove` command is a sub-command used in the Git client tool called "teapot" for managing Jira issues linked to Git commits using the GitHub or Bitbucket Tea Project.

            This command removes specified Jira issues from the list of milestones associated with the given Git commit(s). The `--remote` flag indicates that changes should be pushed to the remote repository, updating the linked Jira issues in the associated project.
        repo: |-
            [AI] The `--flag tea milestones issues remove --repo` command is used in Git to remove issues related to specific milestones from a particular repository. Here's a breakdown of each part:

            * `tea`: This is likely short for "Teamwork Extensions for Agile" or a similar tool, which provides additional features for managing Git repositories in an agile development context.
            * `milestones`: This refers to the set of goals or targets that need to be achieved by specific deadlines.
            * `issues`: These are individual tasks or bugs that need to be addressed in order to complete a project or reach a milestone.
            * `remove`: This means to delete or eliminate the issues from the repository.
            * `--repo`: This specifies which Git repository to apply the command to.
