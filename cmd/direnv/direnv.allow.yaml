documentation:
    command: '[AI] `direnv allow` is a command used in the Direnv library to mark a directory as an environment variable scope. When you navigate into this directory using `cd`, Direnv automatically activates or sources the corresponding environment variables, often defined in a `.envrc` file located within the directory. The command does not take any arguments and should be executed in the terminal while being inside the targeted directory.'
