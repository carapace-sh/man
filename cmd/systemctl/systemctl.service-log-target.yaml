        [AI] The `systemctl service-log-target` command is used in Linux systems to configure where the systemd logging output for a specific service should be written to. By default, the logs are typically stored in the journal files under `/var/log/journal`.

        However, with this command, you can change the target of these logs to other locations or formats such as syslog, stdout, or another file. The general syntax is: `systemctl --property=Journal=<target> start|stop <service_name>` where `<target>` is the desired logging target (e.g., "syslog", "stdout", or a file path).

        This command does not display any output by itself, but rather it sets up the logging configuration for the given service when you start or stop it using systemctl.
