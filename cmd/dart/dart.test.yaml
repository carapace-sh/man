    command: '[AI] The `dart test` command is used to run Dart unit tests defined in a test file with the `.dart` extension using the built-in Dart testing framework, `dart:developer:test`. This command locates all tests within the current directory and its subdirectories by default, compiles them, and runs the tests in isolation. The output provides details about each test case, including whether it passed or failed, and any relevant error messages.'
