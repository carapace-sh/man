    command: '[AI] The `systemctl get-default` command is used to display the current default target for the systemd system and session manager. Systemd is a widely-used init system in Linux distributions, and its default target determines which runlevel or multi-user mode the system starts in at boot time. This command simply returns the name of the active default target, such as "multi-user.target" or "graphical.target".'
