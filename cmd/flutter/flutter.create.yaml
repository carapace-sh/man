documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flutter create` is a command-line tool used in Flutter development for creating new Flutter projects. When invoked with specific arguments, it sets up a new directory with the project structure including essential files and directories such as `lib` folder for source code, `test` folder for tests, `pubspec.yaml` file for defining project metadata, and more. It also initializes necessary packages for running and developing the application using Flutter''s built-in tools like the Dart language engine, hot reload development server, and more.'
    flag:
        android-language: '[AI] The `--android-language` option in the `flutter create` command is used to specify the programming language for the Android platform''s native code when creating a new Flutter project. By default, this option is set to Java, but it can be changed to Kotlin by passing the argument "kotlin". This means that the initial scaffolding of the project, including the `android` directory and its contents, will be configured accordingly for the chosen language.'
        description: '[AI] The `flutter create` command is a tool used in the Flutter framework for creating new Flutter projects. The `--description` option allows you to provide a brief description of the project during its creation. For example, if you run `flutter create --description="My new app: A shopping list app"` it will create a new Flutter project with the name derived from the current directory and append "_project" to it, and also set this description as the project''s short description in `pubspec.yaml`.'
        help: '[AI] `flutter create --help` is a command used in Flutter, a mobile app development framework by Google. This command displays detailed help information about the "create" sub-command of the Flutter CLI (Command Line Interface). It explains how to use this command to create a new Flutter project with a specified name, along with available options for configuring the project''s features like UI tests, Firebase integration, or using a specific template. By providing the `--help` option, you can quickly understand the syntax and capabilities of the command, making it easier to create projects according to your needs.'
        ios-language: '[AI] The `flutter create --ios-language` command is used when initializing a new Flutter project with Xcode as the preferred IDE for iOS development. The `--ios-language` option specifies that the project''s source code for the iOS app should be written in Swift instead of Objective-C by default. It sets up the project structure and integrates it with Xcode, creating necessary files for an iOS app using Swift for the iOS implementation.'
        list-samples: '[AI] `flutter create --list-samples` is a command used in Flutter development to display a list of available sample projects that can be created using the Flutter CLI (Command Line Interface). This command doesn''t actually create any project, but it helps you choose from a selection of templates for different types of applications, such as a new Flutter project, a package or a web app. These templates provide a starting point with pre-configured code structures and assets that can be used as a foundation for your application development.'
        no-offline: '[AI] `flutter create --no-offline` is a command used with the Flutter framework for creating new Flutter projects. The `--no-offline` option disables the local download and caching of packages in the project''s `pubspec.yaml` file during project creation. This means that the required dependencies will be fetched online during the first run of the project, rather than using any locally cached packages. This command assumes you have an active network connection and a stable internet connection for smooth dependency fetching.'
        no-overwrite: '[AI] The `flutter create` command with the `--no-overwrite` option is used when creating a new Flutter project. It instructs the Flutter CLI not to overwrite existing files if some files with the same name already exist in the target directory. Instead, it will append a number to the filename to make it unique and continue with the project creation. This can be useful when setting up a project structure manually or when creating multiple projects with similar file names within the same directory.'
        no-pub: '[AI] The `flutter create` command with the `--no-pub` option is used to create a new Flutter project without initializing the local `pubspec.yaml` file and installing packages from the Flutter package registry (Pub). This means that the project will be set up with only the bare essentials, allowing developers to manually add and manage their dependencies later using the `pub.dev` website or other methods.'
        offline: '[AI] `flutter create --offline` is a command used with the Flutter framework for creating new Flutter projects. The `--offline` flag disables the downloading of packages from the internet during the project creation process. This means that all required packages are fetched from the local cache or come bundled with Flutter itself, allowing for faster and more consistent project creation, especially in environments with limited connectivity or unreliable internet.'
        org: '[AI] The `flutter create --org` command is used with the Flutter framework to create a new Flutter project. The `--org` option sets the organization name for the project in the `pubspec.yaml` file. This is useful when creating multiple projects under one organization, as it keeps the `pubspec.yaml` files consistent and makes it easier to manage dependencies using the Flutter package manager (Pub).'
        overwrite: '[AI] `flutter create --overwrite` is a command used in Flutter development to create a new Flutter project. The `--overwrite` option tells the command to replace any existing files with the default ones provided by Flutter, even if they already exist in the target directory. This can be useful when you want to start a new project from scratch and don''t care about keeping any previous files. Otherwise, use `flutter create` without `--overwrite` to create a new project without affecting existing files.'
        platforms: '[AI] The `flutter create --platforms` command is used to create a new Flutter project with specific target platforms specified. By default, Flutter projects are configured for web, mobile (iOS and Android), and desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) platforms. If you only want to build for certain platforms, you can use the `--platforms` option followed by a comma-separated list of platform names to exclude others. For example, `flutter create my_project --web --mobile` will create a project that only targets web and mobile platforms.'
        project-name: '[AI] `flutter create` is a command-line tool used to create new Flutter projects. The `--project-name` option is used to specify the name of the project you want to create. When you run `flutter create --project-name <your_project_name>`, it will generate a new Flutter project with the given name, including a basic file structure and necessary dependencies for a Flutter application.'
        pub: '[AI] `flutter create --pub` is a command used in Flutter development to create a new Flutter project with Pub (dart package manager) support enabled. This means that when creating the project, `flutter create` will initialize a `pubspec.yaml` file and set up the project to use packages from pub.dev. This command sets up the project structure and necessary configurations for building and running a Flutter application with the Pub client.'
        sample: '[AI] `flutter create --sample` is a command used in Flutter development to quickly create a new Flutter project based on one of the provided templates or samples. The `--sample` option specifies that you want to use a pre-existing sample project as the basis for your new project. Flutter will then download and extract the chosen sample, creating a new directory with the desired project structure and files. This is a convenient way to get started with a new project using best practices and common patterns from the Flutter community.'
        template: '[AI] `flutter create --template` is a command-line utility provided by Flutter, a mobile application development framework. This command creates a new Flutter project with a specified template. By default, it uses the "default" template which sets up a basic Flutter project structure with essential files and directories. However, you can specify other templates like `bloc`, `clean_architecture`, or `firebase` to create projects with those specific structures pre-configured. This can save developers time and effort by providing a solid foundation for building applications in those architectural styles or using particular libraries like BLoC or Firebase.'
