        [AI] `gh ssh-key` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to manage SSH keys. It allows you to generate a new SSH key pair, add the public key to your GitHub account, or show details about existing keys. The specific action depends on how you use it in conjunction with other arguments or flags. For example:

        * `gh ssh-key init`: Generate a new SSH key pair.
        * `gh ssh-key add <filename>`: Add the private key file to your GitHub account.
        * `gh ssh-key show`: Display information about your configured keys.
