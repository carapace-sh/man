documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `gh` command with the `gist view` sub-command is used in GitHub''s Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, `gh`, to open a web browser and display the contents of a specific GitHub Gist in read-only mode. In other words, it allows you to quickly access and view the content of a Gist without leaving your terminal or command prompt.'
    flag:
        filename: '[AI] The command `gh` is a GitHub client for the command line, and the specific command `gh gist view --filename` is used to open a file in a new tab of your default web browser from a GitHub Gist. The `--filename` option specifies the name of the file in the Gist that you want to view. This can be useful if you have a public or shared Gist with multiple files, and you only want to quickly access one particular file without navigating through the entire Gist on GitHub''s website.'
        files: '[AI] The `gh` command is a GitHub CLI tool that allows users to interact with GitHub from the terminal. The specific command `gh gist view --files` is used to view the files of an existing GitHub Gist. This command retrieves information about the specified Gist, including its description, creation date, and a list of its files. By using the `--files` flag, only the file names and sizes are displayed in the output, making it easier for users to identify the files they''re interested in without having to sift through unnecessary details.'
        raw: '[AI] `gh` is a GitHub command-line tool. The command `gh gist view --raw <gist_id>` retrieves the raw content of a specific GitHub Gist with the given ID. The `--raw` option tells `gh` to return the file content directly, without rendering it as markdown or any other format.'
        web: '[AI] `gh` is a command-line tool for interacting with GitHub. The specific command `gh gist view --web <gist_id>` retrieves a specific GitHub Gist (a type of GitHub repository used for small pieces of code or text snippets) and opens it in a web browser. The `--web` option is optional and specifies to open the Gist in a web browser instead of displaying it directly on the command line.'
