    command: '[AI] `tmux set-option` is a TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) command used to change various options in the TMUX environment. The general syntax is `tmux set-option [-g] option value`. The `-g` flag sets the option globally for all sessions, otherwise it applies only to the current session. For instance, `tmux set-option status-background colour red` sets the status bar background color to red.'
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `tmux set-option -F` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to modify the format string of the status bar. The option takes a string argument that defines how the information in the status bar will be displayed. This can include details such as the current window name, session title, and other relevant information. By setting this option, users can customize the appearance of their Tmux terminal sessions to better suit their needs.'
        U: '[AI] `tmux set-option -U` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to update or modify the default option settings for new sessions. The `-U` flag indicates that the change should be applied to the system-wide default settings, rather than just the current session. For example, `tmux set-option -U status-background color255` would set the status bar background color to white in newly created sessions and for all users on the system.'
        a: '[AI] `tmux set-option -a` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to modify or set session, window, or pane options with an additive effect. The `-a` flag means "append" to the existing value instead of overwriting it entirely. For instance, `set-option -A split-window-policy righthoriz` will append "righthoriz" to the list of allowed split directions in the current or active session, allowing both vertical and horizontal splits.'
        g: '[AI] `tmux set-option -g` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to set global options. The `-g` flag indicates that the option should be applied to all new and existing sessions, windows, and panes. For example, `tmux set-option -g mouse on` enables mouse support for all sessions. Other global options could include setting the terminal title or changing the status bar appearance.'
        o: '[AI] `tmux set-option` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that allows you to modify various options. The option `-o` sets an option without saving it in the configuration file. For example, `tmux set-option -g status-bar "bg=red" -o` will change the status bar background color to red temporarily. Without the `-o`, the change would be permanent.'
        p: '[AI] The command `tmux set-option -p` is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to set an option with a given name to its default value. The `-p` flag stands for "permanent", meaning that once set, the option will persist across sessions unless explicitly changed. For example, `tmux set-option -p mode-keys shell` sets the mode keys binding to use the shell''s default keybindings.'
        q: |-
            [AI] `tmux set-option -q` is a command used in the tmux terminal multiplexer to quietly check and set options without displaying any messages or prompts. The `-q` flag stands for "quiet" mode, which means that only the exit status of the command will be displayed, not the output messages. For example, you can use it to check if an option is already set:

            ```sh
            $ tmux set-option -q status-bars on
            ```

            This command will return 0 if the `status-bars` option is already set, and non-zero otherwise. You can also use it to set options, but in this case, the command will only return 0 if the setting was successful:

            ```sh
            $ tmux set-option -q mouse on
            ```

            This command will turn on the mouse mode and return 0 if successful; otherwise, an error message will be displayed and the command will fail.
        s: '[AI] The `tmux` command with the option `set-option` followed by the `-s` flag is used to set or modify session options in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. The `-s` flag specifies that the option should be applied to the current session, rather than the global default. For example, `tmux set-option -s status-background colorblue` sets the background color for the status bar of the current session to blue.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux set-option` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to modify various session, window, and pane options. The `-t` option is used to specify the target identifier or name for the option. For instance, `tmux set-option -t my-session.session-name "MySessionName"` sets the session name of a session named "my-session" to "MySessionName". Other examples include setting window numbering mode (`set-option -t <window> -gw synchronize-panes`) or setting key bindings (`set-option -t <keyboard-shortcut> send-keys "<command>" <modifier>`).'
        u: '[AI] The `tmux` command with the option `set-option -u` is used to unset (remove) an option in the `tmux` terminal multiplexer. The `-u` flag indicates that the change should be unbound from the session, meaning that it will not apply to new sessions but only affect the current one.'
        w: '[AI] The command `tmux set-option -w` is used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to set a window option with a value that is applied to all windows. The `-w` flag indicates that the option should be set for all windows, rather than just the current one. For example, you could use it to change the default pane size or terminal mode key sequence globally across all Tmux sessions.'
