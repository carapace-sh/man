description: run PPP over USB
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "adb ppp" is not a valid Android Debug Bridge (adb) command. Android Debug Bridge is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device. It provides various sub-commands for different functionalities, such as installing and debugging apps, rebooting the device, or pushing/pulling files between the device and the host machine. However, there''s no "ppp" sub-command in adb. If you meant to use a different command, please provide the correct one, and I''ll be glad to help explain it.'
