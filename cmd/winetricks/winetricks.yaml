documentation:
    command: '[AI] WineTricks is a graphical user interface for managing Wineprefixes and installing Windows DLLs and other components in Wine, an open-source compatibility layer that allows running Windows applications on Linux and other POSIX-compliant systems. It simplifies the process of configuring Wine for specific Windows software by automating the installation of necessary dependencies.'
    flag:
        country: '[AI] `winetricks --country` is a command-line option for WineTricks, a Windows compatibility layer for Unix and MacOS systems. This option sets the country code to configure the geolocation settings for some software. The country code determines the default language and regional settings used by applications running under Wine. For example, `--country US` sets the country to the United States. This can be important for certain software that rely on accurate location data.'
        ddrescue: |-
            [AI] `winetricks --ddrescue` is a command used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix-based systems. The `--ddrescue` option is not a built-in Wine tool but rather refers to a data recovery utility called `dd_rescue`, which can be installed using WineTricks as an additional application.

            WineTricks simplifies the installation of Windows software on Linux by managing the necessary Windows libraries and components (DLLs). Installing `--ddrescue` specifically means adding and configuring this data recovery tool within your Wine setup. This allows you to use it alongside other Windows applications in the same Wine environment.
        force: '[AI] `winetricks --force` is a command used with WineTricks, a Windows compatibility layer for Unix-based systems. The `--force` option is used to bypass certain checks and install a Windows component even if it''s already detected or installed. It can be useful in certain situations when a specific application requires a specific version or configuration of a Windows component that WineTricks might not have installed automatically. However, using this option indiscriminately could potentially lead to conflicts or instability in the Wine environment.'
        gui: '[AI] WineTricks is a Windows compatibility layer for running Windows applications under Linux or other Unix-like operating systems, using Wine as the backend. The `--gui` option when invoking WineTricks opens its graphical user interface (GUI), allowing users to easily install and manage Windows components necessary for specific applications to run smoothly in a Wine environment. It simplifies the process of configuring Wine by automatically downloading and installing required redistributable packages, fonts, and other dependencies.'
        help: '[AI] `winetricks --help` is a command used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux and other operating systems. The `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use `winetricks`, which is a utility for managing and installing various components (known as "tricks") required by specific Windows applications to run correctly in Wine. It shows the available commands, their usage, and examples.'
        isolate: '[AI] `winetricks --isolate` is a command-line utility for Wine, a compatibility layer that allows running Windows software on Linux and MacOS. The `--isolate` option creates or manages isolated wine prefixes, which are self-contained environments for installing and running specific Windows applications without interfering with other installed applications in the main wineprefix or each other. By using isolated prefixes, multiple versions of the same application or dependencies can be installed side by side while keeping their configurations separate.'
        keep_isos: |-
            [AI] `winetricks --keep-isos` is a command used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix and macOS. This command is used to manage isolated installation directories (ISOs), which are self-contained Wine prefixes where each ISO represents a separate Windows setup or installation.

            When you run an installer with `winetricks` without specifying an ISO, it creates a new default one. However, with the `--keep-isos` option, you can prevent Wine from deleting existing ISOs when creating a new one. Instead, Wine will use the existing ISO and update it if necessary, making it useful for managing multiple installations of the same Windows version or application.
        no-clean: |-
            [AI] `winetricks` is a Windows compatibility layer for Unix-based systems, allowing users to install and run Windows applications. The command `winetricks --no-clean` is used during installation or configuration of Windows components via Wine.

            The `--no-clean` option tells `winetricks` not to clean up temporary files after the installation process. This can be useful if you need to reinstall the same software multiple times, as it saves time by avoiding the need to redownload and install the required Windows components each time. However, it may also lead to accumulation of unnecessary files over time.
        self-update: '[AI] `winetricks --self-update` is a command used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux and macOS. This command updates the WineTricks application itself to the latest version, which includes new or updated components for better Windows software compatibility.'
        torify: '[AI] `winetricks --torify` is a command used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux and macOS. This specific command configures Wine to use Torify, which is a wrapper for Tor (The Onion Router), a free and open-source anonymity network. By using `winetricks --torify`, you''re enabling Wine applications to access the Tor network through a SOCKS proxy, thus adding an extra layer of security and privacy while browsing or accessing online services.'
        unattended: '[AI] `winetricks --unattended` is a command-line option for WineTricks, a Windows compatibility layer for Unix-based systems like Linux. This option enables unattended installation of Windows software, meaning the user does not need to interactively choose components during the installation process. Instead, the required components are predefined in a configuration file, which is applied automatically when running `winetricks --unattended` with the appropriate command for each software title. This streamlines the installation process and allows for easier mass deployment of Windows applications on Unix systems.'
        verbose: '[AI] `winetricks --verbose` is a command used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux and macOS. This command starts WineTricks with increased logging output, providing more detailed information about the actions it performs. It''s useful for troubleshooting Wine installation issues or for gaining insight into the underlying system modifications that WineTricks makes.'
        verify: '[AI] `winetricks --verify` is a command used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix-like systems. This command checks the installed Windows components and configurations in Wine for potential issues or inconsistencies, ensuring they are properly set up for optimal application performance. By executing `winetricks --verify`, users can identify and resolve any misconfigurations, potentially preventing compatibility problems with specific Windows applications.'
        version: '[AI] `winetricks --version` is a command used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix-based systems. This specific command is used to display the version information of WineTricks, a graphical utility for managing Wine''s configuration. It helps to install and manage various components (dlls, fonts, etc.) needed by certain Windows applications to run smoothly under Wine. The output will show the version number and revision of WineTricks.'
