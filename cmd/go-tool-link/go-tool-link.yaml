documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `go-tool-link` is not a standard command or tool in Go programming language. It seems like there might be some confusion with different tools or commands named similarly. In Go, we have `go` tool which includes several sub-commands like `go build`, `go test`, etc. for building and testing Go packages. If you meant one of those specific Go commands, please provide more context or the correct command name.'
    flag:
        B: '[AI] The `go-tool-link -B` command is a part of the Go programming language''s `go` tool. It is used to update the imports in `go.mod` and `go.sum` files when the dependencies in the current module have been changed. The `-B` flag tells the command to perform an incremental build-sum update without re-downloading or re-installing any dependencies that are already up-to-date, which can save time during development.'
        E: '[AI] The `go-tool-link -E` command is a part of the Go programming language''s `go` tool. It stands for "Link" and the `-E` flag is used to perform an explicit linking of Go objects without any further compilation or building of the program. In simpler terms, it links precompiled Go object files together to create an executable binary or shared library.'
        H: '[AI] `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, used for managing the links to external packages or modules in a Go project. The option `-H` stands for "--help" and when used with this command it will display detailed information about how to use the `go-tool-link` command along with its available flags and their functions. This can be useful for users who are new to the tool or want to refresh their memory on how to use specific features.'
        I: |-
            [AI] The `go-tool-link -I` command is a part of the Go programming language's `go` toolkit. It's used to add or update the Go import paths in a file or a directory, making it easier for the Go compiler to locate and build dependent packages during compilation.

            When you run `go-tool-link -I <path>`, it adds the specified `<path>` as an import path to your current Go workspace. This is useful when working with custom or third-party packages that are not in the standard library, but are located outside of the default import search paths.

            By updating the import paths, the Go compiler can correctly locate and build the required dependencies during compilation, ensuring a successful build process.
        L: '[AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language ecosystem, specifically the `govendor` dependency management system. The `-L` or `--list` flag is used to display a list of all transitive dependencies for a given package in the project''s vendor tree. It helps developers understand the full dependency graph and track potential issues such as duplicate imports or outdated packages.'
        R: '[AI] `go-tool-link -R` is a command from the Go programming language''s `govbuild` toolset. The `-R` flag stands for "recursive." When used with `go-tool-link`, it links all Go dependencies of a project and its subdirectories recursively. This means that not only the immediate dependencies of the main module are linked, but also those of any nested projects within the tree. This helps ensure a consistent build environment by resolving all required packages to their intended versions.'
        T: '[AI] The `go-tool-link -T` command is a part of the Go programming language''s `govbuild` tool, which is used to build and test Go packages. The `-T` flag specifically stands for "test only." When this flag is passed to the `go build` or `go test` commands (both of which can be run with `govbuild`), it instructs the tool to only run the tests associated with the given package, without building the actual code. This can save time during development when you want to quickly check if your tests are passing or failing.'
        X: |-
            [AI] The `go-tool-link -X` command is a part of the Go programming language's `go` tool. It is used to rewrite Go source files with custom import paths or flags by modifying the corresponding GOFILE and GOPATH environment variables. The `-X` flag stands for "extended" linking, which allows specifying multiple custom import paths or flags in a single command. For example:

            ```sh
            GOFILE=myprog.go GOFLAG=-X mypkg/flag:Value GOLINK="-X importpath1 -X importpath2" go build
            ```

            This command tells the Go compiler to rewrite `myprog.go`'s imports according to the given flags and link packages from the specified import paths during the build process.
        asan: '[AI] `go-tool-link -asan` is a command provided by Google''s Go toolchain. The `-asan` flag enables Address Sanitizer (ASAN), which is a memory safety testing tool integrated into the Go compiler and runtime. By using this flag during compilation, the generated binary will contain additional checks for memory bounds violations, null pointer dereferencing, and other memory-related issues. This can help in detecting and locating memory bugs at runtime.'
        aslr: '[AI] `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library. The `-aslr` (Address Space Layout Randomization) flag is used to enable Address Space Layout Randomization when linking Go executables or shared libraries. This security feature randomizes the memory layout of the program at runtime, making it harder for attackers to exploit memory vulnerabilities by guessing memory addresses. It adds an extra layer of protection against buffer overflows and stack smashing attacks.'
        benchmark: '[AI] `go-tool-link -benchmark` is a command-line tool provided by Go programming language for running and measuring the performance of Go source code using its built-in benchmarking feature. It links the main Go application with any required dependencies and then runs the benchmarks defined in the test files. The results are displayed as statistics on the number of iterations, operations per second, memory usage, and allocation patterns for each function being benchmarked. This information helps developers optimize their code for better performance.'
        benchmarkprofile: '[AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language ecosystem. The `-benchmarkprofile` option is used when building or testing Go projects with benchmarks to generate detailed profiling information for those benchmarks. When this flag is specified, the Go linker produces a binary file that contains the benchmark results, which can then be analyzed using various visualization tools or further processed for statistical analysis. The resulting data provides insights into the performance of specific parts of your code during execution and can help in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing your code.'
        buildid: '[AI] `go-tool-link buildid` is a command provided by the Go programming language''s `go` tool. This command is used to determine and display the build identifier (also known as the Go version) for a given Go executable or package. The output consists of the major, minor, and patch version numbers in decimal format separated by dots, along with an optional suffix indicating additional information about the build such as the operating system or commit hash. For instance, `go version go1.16.4 darwin/amd64` indicates Go version 1.16.4 for the Darwin (Apple) operating system on the x86\_64 architecture.'
        buildmode: |-
            [AI] The `go-tool-link` with the `-buildmode` flag is a command-line tool from the Go programming language ecosystem. It's specifically used to build and link Go packages into executable binary files or shared libraries.

            When you use the `-buildmode` option, you specify the desired output format for your Go program. There are two possible values: "exec" (or "c-archive") for creating an executable binary file, and "shared" for generating a shared library. The exact behavior depends on the linker used by your system, but generally speaking, this option influences how the Go compiler generates the linking information and how the resulting artifact is used in various contexts.

            For example, if you want to build an executable program named "myapp" using the Go packages "github.com/user/package1" and "github.com/user/package2", you could use the following command:

            ```bash
            go-tool-link -buildmode=exec myapp main.go github.com/user/package1 github.com/user/package2
            ```

            This will create an executable named "myapp" that includes all the required dependencies from the specified packages.
        c: '[AI] `go-tool-link -c` is a command from the Go programming language''s `go` tool. This specific command, `-c`, stands for "compile." When you run this command in your terminal or command prompt, it instructs the Go tool to compile the Go source code files listed as arguments into executable binary files. The resulting binaries will be placed in the current directory by default.'
        capturehostobjs: '[AI] `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in the Go programming language''s `govment` package, used to manage linking of Go packages and their dependencies. The `-capturehostobjs` flag is an option for this command. When used, it instructs `go-tool-link` to capture any host object files (non-Go library files) required by the packages being linked and store them in the output directory instead of linking them directly. This can be useful when trying to build Go packages into a single binary without having access to the original source code or dependencies, as it allows you to include all necessary host objects in the final binary distribution.'
        compressdwarf: '[AI] `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, specifically used for linking Go object files into executables or shared libraries. The `-compressdwarf` flag is an option that can be passed to this command. This flag compresses the DWARF debug information using the compressed DWARF format (also known as dwarf-dump or abbreviated DWARF), making the binary smaller and faster to transfer or load into memory. Compressed DWARF data is still readable by most debugging tools.'
        cpuprofile: |-
            [AI] The `go-tool-link` command with the `-cpuprofile` flag is a part of the Go programming language's `govbuild` toolchain. It generates or updates CPU profiles for Go programs during testing or benchmarking.

            When you run tests or benchmarks in the Go environment, this flag instructs the linker to create or update a CPU profile file. The generated file records the CPU usage of each function and goroutine during execution, providing valuable information for performance analysis and optimization.

            The format of the profile data is either a `.cpuprofile` binary file (for Go 1.9 and later) or a text-based `.prof` file (for earlier versions). These files can be analyzed by various profiling tools, such as Go's `pprof` tool, to help identify performance bottlenecks in the code.
        d: '[AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language ecosystem, specifically designed for managing replacements of imported packages in Go projects. The `-d` flag stands for "delete" and is used to remove previously recorded package replacings from the `go.mod` file. By deleting old entries, you ensure that the project will fetch the latest versions of the specified packages during the next `go get` command execution. This helps in maintaining a fresh and up-to-date dependency tree for your Go projects.'
        debugnosplit: '[AI] `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in Go programming language''s `govmmt` suite. The `-debugnosplit` flag is used to link Go programs without splitting the debug information into separate files, keeping it embedded within the executable binary instead. This can simplify the deployment process and reduce the overall binary size.'
        debugtextsize: '[AI] `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool from Golang''s go toolset, used to manage the linking and loading of Go packages. The `-debugtextsize` flag sets the size limit for debug information included in the generated binary. By default, this flag is not set and no limit is imposed on the size of the debug information. However, when you set this flag, it restricts the size of the debug information to the specified value in bytes. This can be useful when trying to keep the size of your binary as small as possible while still retaining essential debugging capabilities.'
        debugtramp: '[AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used for linking Go binaries and shared libraries. The `-debugtramp` flag is an optional argument for this tool. It generates a debug information trampoline when creating a statically linked binary with the `cgo` package. This debug trampoline facilitates the proper functioning of the debugger, allowing it to step into C code called from Go. Without the `-debugtramp`, the debugger may not be able to effectively debug issues in the C code within a statically linked Go binary.'
        dumpdep: '[AI] `go-tool-link dumpdep` is a command-line tool from the Golang standard library used for resolving and printing Go package dependencies. When you run this command in your terminal, located within your Go project directory, it will analyze your `go.mod` or `go.sum` files (dependency management files), then print out a list of all the required direct and indirect packages along with their respective versions. This information can help you understand and manage the dependency structure of your Go projects.'
        extar: '[AI] `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in the Go programming language''s `govmmt` (Go Vendor Management Tool) suite, which helps manage dependencies and their versions. The `-extar` flag is an argument to this tool, and it stands for "extract archives." When used with the `go-tool-link` command, it extracts the contents of Go modules downloaded as archive files (such as `.zip` or `.tar.gz`) into their intended directories within the Go module cache. This flag facilitates managing dependencies with ease and maintaining an organized workspace.'
        extld: '[AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in Go programming language''s `$GOPATH/bin` directory. The `-extld` flag is an option for this tool used to specify the external linker to be used during linking of Go programs. This can be useful when building applications that depend on non-Go libraries or when using custom linkers, such as Gold or BFD. It allows developers to control the linking process and ensure compatibility with specific linkers.'
        extldflags: |-
            [AI] `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language ecosystem. The `-extldflags` option is used to pass extended linker flags to the Go linker during compilation. These flags can be used to customize the linking process, such as specifying additional libraries or defining symbols for linker resolution. For example:

            ```sh
            go build -o myprogram main.go -linknames someFunction -extldflags "-L./mylibs -lmylibrary"
            ```

            Here, we're telling Go to link the `main.go` file into an executable named `myprogram`, while defining a symbol named `someFunction` for linker resolution and passing custom linker flags to link libraries located in the `./mylibs` directory and linking against the library `mylibrary`.
        f: '[AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used to manage the linking of Go packages. The `-f` flag is an option for this tool, which stands for "force." When using this flag, the linker will replace any existing files in the output directory with the linked packages, even if there are no changes to the input files. This can be useful when dealing with dependency conflicts or when trying to update linked packages without rebuilding the entire project.'
        g: '[AI] The `go-tool-link -g` command is a part of the Go programming language''s `go` tool. It is used to update and manage the dependencies of a Go project by rewriting symbolic links in the `GOPATH/pkg` directories to point to the latest versions of the required packages. The `-g` flag stands for "go get" and instructs the command to download and install any missing dependencies recursively from their respective repositories, and then update the existing ones to their latest available versions.'
        h: |-
            [AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language's standard library, specifically under the `cmd/links` package. Its primary function is to update shortcuts or symbolic links in a Go module repositories to point to their intended locations based on the go.mod file.

            The `-h` flag is a common flag used to display help information for commands. In this context, using `go-tool-link -h` will print out detailed usage instructions and available flags/options for using `go-tool-link`. It will include information on how to install the tool (as it's part of Go's standard library), basic usage examples, and any optional flags and their descriptions.
        importcfg: '[AI] `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in Go programming language''s `govmtools` suite, which helps manage imports and links between modules. The `-importcfg` option is used to generate or update import configuration files (`.imports`). When run with this option, `go-link` reads the current module''s `go.mod` file to obtain a list of required modules and their versions. It then generates or updates the import configuration files in the current and dependent modules with this information. This ensures that all Go projects within the ecosystem stay consistent with the specified dependencies and can be easily managed using other Go tools like `go get`.'
        installsuffix: '[AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used to manage and update the dependencies of a Go project. The `-installsuffix` option is an argument that specifies a suffix to be appended to the names of installed packages when they are stored on disk. By default, this suffix is empty, meaning the original package name will be used. However, setting `-installsuffix` to a specific value can help prevent naming conflicts between different packages or versions when multiple packages have similar names. For instance, setting it to `_v1` would result in installed packages being named like `<original-name>_v1`.'
        k: '[AI] `go-tool-link -k` is a command used with the Go programming language''s `go` tool. It stands for "link key file." This command generates or updates a linker key file (`.go-link`) which stores information about external symbols required by Go packages, such as C or C++ libraries, that need to be linked at build time. By using this command with the `-k file.go-link` option, you can specify a key file to create or update, making it easier to manage external library dependencies in your Go projects.'
        libgcc: '[AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in the Go programming language''s standard library (located under `$GOPATH/bin/`) used to link Go source code into an executable or shared library. The specific flag `-libgcc` is used when cross-compiling Go code for systems that do not have their own version of the GNU C Library (glibc), but still require it to build the project. With this flag, Go will look for the provided libgcc.a static archive file during linking and incorporate it into the output binary or shared library. This ensures that any required glibc functions are available in the final product.'
        linkmode: |-
            [AI] `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used for resolving and linking dependencies among Go packages. The `-linkmode` option specifies the type of linking to perform:

            1. **Normal**: In this mode, `go-link` performs regular linking, which means it resolves and links all transitive dependencies and produces a single output file for each import path. It creates shared objects on Unix-based systems and DLLs on Windows.

            2. **External**: In External linking mode, the tool does not build or link any object files. Instead, it only checks whether all the required external libraries are present and correctly linked. This is useful when you want to ensure that your Go program uses the correct versions of external libraries without building them again.

            3. **Bare**: Bare linking mode links the main package directly to its dependencies without creating any wrapper packages or binary files. It can be useful for developing custom build systems or integrating with other tools that require a different build process.

            These modes provide flexibility in managing and linking your Go projects depending on your specific use case.
        linkshared: '[AI] `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, specifically used for resolving and creating shared libraries or DLLs (on different platforms). The `-linkshared` option instructs it to create a shared library during linking, instead of a static one. This results in smaller memory usage and potential performance improvements when multiple programs use the same code.'
        memprofile: '[AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, specifically the `go/links` package. The `memprof` flag is used with this tool to create or update memory profiling data files. When you run `go-tool-link -memprofile`, it processes the memory profiles in the specified Go application and produces a series of output files that contain detailed information about memory usage in the program. These files are typically named `pprof.{cpu,heap}.{gz|txt}` and can be used with other profiling tools like `pprof` to generate visualizations or perform additional analysis on the captured data.'
        memprofilerate: '[AI] `go-tool-link go:linker` is a Go tool used to perform linking tasks during Go compilation. The `-memprofrate` flag is an option passed to the `pprof` memory profiler during linking. It sets the sampling rate for the memory profiler in Hz. A higher value results in more detailed profiles but increased overhead during program execution.'
        msan: '[AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in Go programming language''s standard library, specifically the `gosxc` compiler. The `-msan` flag enables Memory Safety Analyzer (MSAN) during linking. MSAN is a static analysis tool provided by Google that helps detect memory safety issues such as use-after-free and null pointer dereferencing in Go programs at compile time. By enabling it with the `-msan` flag, the generated binary will contain additional checks for these issues.'
        "n": '[AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in Go programming language''s `govbuild` or `go` toolset. The `-n` flag stands for "no follow" or "don''t follow links." When used with the `go-tool-link` command, it prevents the tool from resolving symbolic links when finding packages and dependencies during a build or install process. This can be useful in cases where you want to ensure that specific versions of packages are used, rather than having symbolic links point to newer or different versions.'
        o: '[AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used to manage application dependencies and build executables. The `-o` flag stands for "output file" and is used to specify the name and location of the output file or binary that will be generated after linking the Go program with its dependencies. For example, `go-tool-link -o myprogram myprogram.exe` will generate an executable named "myprogram.exe" when linking the "myprogram" Go project.'
        pluginpath: |-
            [AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in Go programming language's standard library, specifically under the `$GOPATH/bin` directory. It's used to update and manage the links between the Go source files and their compiled binary counterparts.

            The `-pluginpath` flag is an option that can be passed when invoking this command. It specifies a directory where Go plugins, which are shared libraries with the `.so` or `.dll` suffix for Unix and Windows respectively, should be searched for. By setting this flag to a valid directory, you enable the `go-tool-link` to locate and properly link any required plugins when building your Go projects.
        r: '[AI] `go-tool-link -r` is a command-line tool in Go programming language''s `govbuild` or `gob` packages. It resolves and sets up missing imports for Go source files or packages by downloading required modules from the Go Modules repository (proxied through `proxy.golang.org`) and linking them to the local workspace. The `-r` flag stands for "recursive" mode, which means it performs this action recursively for all dependencies, not just directly imported packages, ensuring a consistent dependency tree.'
        race: '[AI] `go-tool-race` is a command-line tool provided by Go programming language for conducting concurrent race detection. It analyzes source code to find potential data races, which are conditions where multiple goroutines access shared variables in a way that may lead to data inconsistency or erroneous program behavior. By running `go-tool-race` with the `-race` flag, you initiate this analysis on your Go source code. The tool reports any detected races along with suggestions for resolving them.'
        s: '[AI] `go-tool-link -s` is a command provided by the Go programming language''s `go` tool. This command is used to update imports of Go source files by resolving and updating symbolic links to their actual packages. The `-s` flag stands for "recursive" or "follow symlinks," which means that it will not only process the file specified but also all dependencies and sub-dependencies recursively, ensuring the consistency and correctness of import paths throughout your project.'
        strictdups: '[AI] `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library, specifically used to manage dependencies and their links. The `-strictdups` flag is an option for this command. It ensures that only exact duplicate imports are replaced when resolving dependencies. This flag helps maintain consistency in the import paths within a project and avoid potential conflicts or issues caused by subtle differences between imported packages.'
        tmpdir: '[AI] The `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library used to update or resolve missing imports for Go source files. The `-tmpdir` option specifies a directory where temporary files will be stored during linking operations. This flag can be set to manage the location of these temporary files and prevent potential conflicts with other processes or file systems.'
        v: '[AI] `go-tool-link` is a command-line tool in the Go programming language''s `govendors` workflow. The `-v` (verbose) flag, when used with this tool, increases the level of output provided during linking. It displays detailed information about which modules are being installed or updated, along with their versions and dependencies. This can help in debugging build issues and understanding the Go dependency tree.'
        w: '[AI] `go-tool-link -w` is a command provided by the Go programming language''s `go` tool. It stands for "workspace link" and its `-w` flag option is used to update the go.sum file in the current workspace to reference the latest versions of the imported packages listed in the go.mod file. This command ensures that the dependencies within a Go project are always kept up-to-date, which can help maintain a healthy development environment.'
