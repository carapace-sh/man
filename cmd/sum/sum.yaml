documentation:
    command: "[AI] The `sum` command is a common utility in Unix-like operating systems used to compute the sum of numbers in a list or the sum of the contents of files. When given a list of numbers as arguments, it prints out the sum of those numbers. When given one or more files as arguments, it prints out the sum of the contents of those files, i.e., the total number of bytes. The output is separated from the input by line breaks, and an optional `-c` flag can be used to display the count of input lines along with their total sum. For example:\n\n```bash\n$ sum 1 2 3\n12\n$ sum file1 file2\n3456 \n3508\n```"
    flag:
        help: '[AI] The `sum` is a command-line utility in Unix-based systems for calculating the sum of files sizes. The option `--help` is used to display detailed help information about how to use the `sum` command, including available options, examples, and usage. When you run `sum --help`, it will print out the usage message along with a brief description of each option supported by the command.'
        r: '[AI] The `sum` command with the `-r` option is used in Unix or Linux systems to calculate the sum of the file sizes in a directory recursively. When you run `sum -r <directory>`, it calculates and displays the sum of the sizes of all files (including hidden ones) within the specified directory and its subdirectories. It''s useful for checking the total size of a directory tree.'
        sysv: |-
            [AI] The `sum --sysv` command in Linux is used to compute the sum of the contents of files under a given directory and displays the result in a format following the System V initialization script naming convention.

            In more detail, when used with the `--sysv` option, the `sum` command generates output that includes the filename, its size in bytes, and the checksum (usually MD5 or CRC32) of each file. This information is displayed in columns, with the first column showing the filename and the following columns representing size and checksum respectively. The columns are separated by whitespaces and aligned based on their header labels at the top.

            Overall, `sum --sysv` helps system administrators to verify file integrity and perform auditing tasks.
        version: '[AI] The `sum` command with the `--version` option is used to display the version information of Sum, a software utility for managing and tracking files and directories. When executed in a terminal or command-line interface, it will print out the name of the Sum software, its version number, and sometimes additional information like the compilation timestamp or the operating system it was built for.'
