description: Generate a shell completion for Grype (listing local docker images)
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `grype completion` is a command used in the Grype vulnerability scanning tool to enable or configure auto-completion for various shells (like Bash, Zsh, etc.) when writing scans or queries. It allows users to quickly enter and modify common vulnerability names, scan configurations, or other Grype-specific commands without having to remember their exact syntax. The specific use of this command may vary depending on the user''s shell setup, but it generally involves running it with a specific shell configuration file or in a terminal session where auto-completion is enabled. For example: `grype completion > <shell-file>`.'
