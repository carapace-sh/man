documentation:
    command: '[AI] `apt-get purge` is a command used in Debian and Ubuntu based Linux distributions to completely remove an installed package along with its configuration files. This includes not only the data files but also the configuration files that were modified during installation, restoring the system to its original state before the package was installed. The `--reinstall` option can be used to force the reinstallation of a previously installed package and its dependencies, ensuring their latest versions are installed.'
