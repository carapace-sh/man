documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp` is a command used in the Flutter framework for building and creating a packaged application for the Windows Universal Platform (UWP). It compiles your Flutter project''s code, merges it with the generated native code using the Flutter Engine, and packages it into a .appxbundle file that can be installed on UWP systems.'
    flag:
        analyze-size: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp --analyze-size` is a command used in Flutter development to analyze the size of a Windows Universal Platform (UWP) app''s binary executables and components after building. It provides detailed information about the size of each file, enabling developers to identify large files or unnecessary dependencies and optimize their app for smaller binaries.'
        dart-define: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp --dart-define` is a command used in Flutter development to create a Windows Universal Package (UWP) app. The `--dart-define` option allows defining constants in the Dart code before building the project. This can be useful for passing configuration values or enabling/disabling features at build time without modifying the code directly. For example, you could define a constant to control whether your app runs in debug mode or release mode by setting an environment variable and referencing it with `--dart-define=APP_MODE=Debug`. The resulting UWP app will have this constant available during runtime.'
        debug: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp --debug` is a command used in Flutter development for building a Windows Universal Platform (UWP) application from its source code. The `--debug` argument enables the generation of debug symbols and other debugging artefacts, facilitating the identification and resolution of issues during the development process.'
        help: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp --help` is a command used in Flutter, a mobile app development framework, to build a Windows Universal Platform (UWP) app. The `--help` flag is an argument that requests displaying the detailed help information related to building for UWP platform. It provides information on the available options, usage, and examples to facilitate the correct usage of the command for creating a production-ready UWP app from your Flutter project.'
        no-analyze-size: |-
            [AI] `flutter build winuwp` is a command used to build a Flutter application for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). The `--no-analyze-size` flag is an option that disables size analysis during the build process.

            Size analysis is a feature in Flutter that helps optimize the application's size by identifying unused assets and removing them from the final package. However, disabling this feature can result in larger package sizes but may be necessary when dealing with specific dependencies or libraries that generate excessive metadata or other unnecessary files.

            In summary, using `flutter build winuwp --no-analyze-size` instructs Flutter to build a UWP application without performing size analysis during the process.
        no-null-assertions: |-
            [AI] `flutter build winuwp` is a command used to build a Flutter application for the UWP (Universal Windows Platform). The `--no-null-assertions` flag disables null safety checks during the build process.

            When Dart code doesn't explicitly check for null values, or when there is a possibility of null values being passed around, it can lead to NullPointerExceptions at runtime. To mitigate this risk and improve application stability, Flutter by default uses null safety checks since version 2.12.

            However, when building UWP applications, some APIs may not adhere to the Dart null safety rules, causing build failures. In such cases, disabling null assertion checks using `--no-null-assertions` can help the build process complete successfully, even though it might introduce potential runtime null pointer exceptions. It's essential to be aware of this trade-off and consider implementing proper null checks in your codebase whenever possible.
        no-obfuscate: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp` is a command used in Flutter to build a Windows Universal Platform (UWP) app. The `--no-obfuscate` flag is an optional argument that disables obfuscation during the build process. Obfuscation is a technique used to make code harder to read and reverse engineer, but it can also impact performance and cause compatibility issues with some libraries. Disabling obfuscation allows for easier debugging and analysis of the UWP app code.'
        no-pub: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp --no-pub` is a command used in Flutter development to build a Windows Universal Platform (UWP) app. The `--no-pub` option is passed to disable the publication of the app to the public GitHub repository during the build process. This means that the generated package will not be uploaded to the Flutter Gallery or any other public repository, and instead, it will only be saved locally on your machine. The command generates a `.appx` file for the UWP app, which can then be installed locally on Windows machines using tools like Visual Studio.'
        no-track-widget-creation: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp` is a command used to build a Flutter application for the UWP (Universal Windows Platform). The `--no-track-widget-creation` flag is an optional argument that instructs the Flutter build tool not to create any tracking widgets during the build process. Tracking widgets are used for collecting usage statistics and analytics data. By disabling their creation, this flag can be useful when building applications for internal use or when privacy is a concern.'
        no-tree-shake-icons: |-
            [AI] `flutter build winuwp` is a command used to build a Flutter application for the Windows Universal Platform (UWP). The `--no-tree-shake-icons` flag is an optional argument that disables tree shaking of icons during the build process.

            Tree shaking is a technique used in Flutter and other modern JavaScript frameworks to eliminate unused code from the final output. However, this technique does not apply to icons as they are typically embedded as binary data rather than being represented by code. Thus, disabling tree shaking for icons will prevent their removal during the build process, ensuring that all the required icons are included in the final UWP application package.
        null-assertions: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp` is a command used to build a Flutter application for the UWP (Universal Windows Platform). Adding the option `--null-assertions` disables null-check warnings during compilation, allowing the application to run even if it has potential null reference issues. This could be useful when developing or debugging an application but should be used with caution as ignoring null checks can lead to runtime errors.'
        obfuscate: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp --obfuscate` is a command used in Flutter development to build a Windows Universal Platform (UWP) application and apply obfuscation to the output code. Obfuscation is a technique that aims to make the code harder to read or reverse engineer by renaming symbols, removing unreachable code, and other transformations. This can help protect intellectual property and improve application security. The resulting code will be more difficult for others to understand and potentially modify.'
        profile: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp --profile` is a command used in Flutter development to create a package for building Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. The `--profile` option specifies the desired build profile, which can be set to `release` or `debug`. In release mode, optimizations are applied and debugging symbols are stripped, resulting in smaller app sizes and improved performance at the cost of losing debugging capabilities. In contrast, debug mode maintains debugging symbols and other development features for easier debugging during development.'
        pub: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp --pub` is a command used in Flutter development to build a Windows Universal Platform (UWP) application from the source code. The `--pub` option here is for running `pub get` command before building, ensuring that all required dependencies are downloaded and installed. Therefore, this single command fetches dependencies, performs a build for UWP target platform and generates the necessary artifacts for deployment or packaging.'
        release: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp --release` is a command used in Flutter development to build a Windows Universal Platform (UWP) app in release mode. This means that the output will be optimized for production use, with minimal debug information included. The built application can then be installed on a UWP-compatible device or emulator for deployment.'
        split-debug-info: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp` is a command used in Flutter to create a Windows Universal Package (UWP) app from the project''s source code. The `--split-debug-info` flag is an optional argument that instructs Flutter to split the debug information for the UWP app into separate .pdb files per DLL, instead of having one large .pdb file containing all the debug information. This can improve the startup time and reduce memory usage when debugging a UWP app in Visual Studio.'
        target: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp --target` is a command used in Flutter, a cross-platform mobile development framework. This specific command is for building a Windows Universal Platform (UWP) app from the project''s source code. The `--target` option specifies the target platform for the build process. In this case, it targets UWP. The result will be an installable package for the Windows Store or other UWP-compatible environments.'
        track-widget-creation: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp` is a command used in Flutter to build a Windows Universal Platform (UWP) app. The `--track-widget-creation` flag is an optional argument that enables tracking of widget creation during the build process. This can help with diagnosing issues related to the rendering or layout of UI widgets in the UWP app, as it generates additional diagnostic output during the build.'
        tree-shake-icons: '[AI] `flutter build winuwp` is a command used to build a Flutter application for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). The `--tree-shake-icons` flag is an optional argument that enables icon optimization during the build process. This flag instructs the Flutter tooling to perform tree shaking on the icons used in the application, which are typically embedded as resources in the assets folder. Tree shaking is a process of removing unused code from the final output, reducing the size of the resulting executable. By applying this optimization to the icons, the generated UWP package will be smaller, improving the app''s start-up time and overall efficiency.'
