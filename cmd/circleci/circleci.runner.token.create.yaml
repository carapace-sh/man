description: Create a token for a resource-class
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `circleci runner token create` is a command used in CircleCI to generate a new API token for a CircleCI Runner. The Runner uses this token to authenticate with the CircleCI platform and communicate about its status, available resources, and jobs to be run. This command typically is executed within the context of a runner machine or via CircleCI''s CLI tools, like `circleci`, installed on a developer''s local machine. The generated token can then be added to the runner configuration to establish communication with the CircleCI platform.'
