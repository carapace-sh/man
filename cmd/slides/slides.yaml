documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "slides" command is not a standard command in any specific context or operating system. It may refer to commands used in presentation software like Google Slides, Microsoft PowerPoint, or Apple Keynote for creating, managing, or advancing through slides in a presentation. Without further context, it''s impossible to determine the exact meaning of the "slides" command.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] The `--help` argument is not a flag itself, but rather an option that is commonly used with commands or programs to display their help documentation. When you run a command followed by `--help`, it will print out detailed information about how to use that command, including any available flags and their functions. For example, if you have a tool called "slides" and you want to know how to use it, running the command `slides --help` would provide you with the necessary information.'
