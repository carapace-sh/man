documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `jj log` command is specific to the Jupyter Notebook editor (Jupyter''s JavaScript interface). It creates or appends a new entry in the Jupyter notebook''s main log file, located at `~/.jupyter/notebook/notebook.log`. This log keeps track of important system messages and events related to running Jupyter Notebook sessions.'
    flag:
        color-words: '[AI] The `--color-words` option is a flag used with the `jj` logging tool. It enables the colorization of specific words in the output, making it easier to identify certain messages or log levels in the log file. For instance, error messages might be displayed in red, warnings in yellow, and informational messages in white. This can significantly improve readability and efficiency when working with large log files.'
        git: '[AI] The `jj log --git` command is used in JJ, a Git-like command line tool for recording and managing local changes in files without committing them to a remote repository. This specific command displays the commit history of the current branch or the selected commit, similar to Git''s `log` command. The `--git` flag is optional and provides additional information as if the changes were made in a Git repository. It doesn''t affect the functionality significantly but adds more details like author names, commit messages, and parent commit hashes, enhancing the readability of the output.'
        help: '[AI] `jj log --help` is a command used in Jupyter Notebook''s Jupyter Journal (jj) tool. It requests for help information about the `log` sub-command of jj. The output provides a brief description, usage examples and available options for using the `log` command effectively. This command assists users in understanding how to utilize this functionality correctly within the Jupyter Notebook environment.'
        limit: '[AI] The `jj log --limit` command is a utility used in the Juju deployment and configuration management tool. It''s specifically designed to retrieve a limited number of logs from Juju models, units or charms. By using the `--limit` option, you can specify how many log entries you want to see, allowing for efficient viewing of recent logs without having to sift through an excessive amount of data.'
        no-graph: '[AI] The `jj log --no-graph` command is used in Jupyter Notebooks to view the log messages without displaying any graphs or visualizations. The `--no-graph` option prevents the output of any plots or charts that might be generated by cells in the notebook. This can be helpful when debugging code or when working with large datasets where graphical output is not desired.'
        patch: '[AI] The `--patch` option in the `jj log` command is used with Git''s interactive rebase feature provided by Jira''s JetBrains TeamCity plugin, JJ-CI. It applies a series of changes (patches) to the current branch being rebased, based on the differences between two specified commits. These patches are typically generated from pull requests in Jira and are applied during the rebase process, allowing for conflict resolution and ensuring that the codebase remains up-to-date with the latest changes. This command is used to incorporate multiple changes into a single Git branch in a controlled manner.'
        reversed: '[AI] The `jj log --reversed` command is used in Jupyter Notebook to display the notebook''s change log in reverse order. The option `--reversed` specifies that the output should be shown with the most recent changes appearing first, instead of the default behavior where the oldest changes appear first. This can be useful when reviewing the history of a notebook and wanting to see the latest modifications first.'
        revisions: '[AI] The `jj log --revisions` command is a sub-command of Jumpbox (jj), a Git-like tool for working with Mercurial repositories. This command displays information about the available revisions or changesets in a Mercurial repository, starting from the latest one and moving backwards through the commit history. The output typically includes each revision''s unique identifier (node), author, date, and a brief commit message describing the changes made.'
        stat: '[AI] The `jj log --stat` command is used in Jira to generate a statistical report for issues logged in Jira. It displays various metrics such as issue count, open vs closed issues, average resolution time, and other relevant data for a specified project or filter. This information helps in monitoring the progress of projects and identifying trends in issue management.'
        summary: '[AI] The `jj log --summary` command is a function provided by JJ, an interactive Git GUI tool. It generates a summary of the last few Git commits in your current branch, displaying key information such as author name and email, commit message, and the number of added and deleted lines for each commit. This can help users quickly review the changes made in their most recent commits before pushing or merging their work.'
        template: |-
            [AI] `jj log --template` is a command used in the Jupyter Notebook interactive computing environment for managing and formatting logs. The `--template` option specifies a custom template string for formatting the output of `jj log`. This allows users to specify the desired layout for their log messages, including fields such as timestamp, log level, and message content. When used without additional arguments, `jj log --template` displays the current log template. To set a new template, provide the `--template` option with the desired string containing placeholders for formatting. For example:

            ```bash
            jj log --template "%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(message)s"
            ```

            This sets the log template to display the timestamp, log level, and message in the output.
        tool: '[AI] `jj log --tool` is a command used in JJ, a development platform for building and deploying web applications. This specific command is for generating logs related to a particular tool or service integrated with JJ. The flags `--tool` specifies the name of the integrated tool for which logs are desired. The output will contain detailed information about the tool''s activity and performance, helping developers diagnose issues and monitor its behavior.'
        types: '[AI] The `jj log --types` command is used in JJ, a popular logging tool, to retrieve logs of specific types. This command filters the logs based on their types and displays them to the user. For instance, if you want to see only error logs, you can use `jj log --types error`. This will display all the error logs in your system. It helps in quickly accessing and analyzing logs for specific events or issues.'
