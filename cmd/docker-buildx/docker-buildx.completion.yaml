documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker-buildx completion` is a command used to generate shell completions for Docker Buildx, which is a new feature in Docker Desktop (version 3.0 and later) that enables multi-context builds using multiple buildx contexts. The command generates the necessary scripts for shells like Bash or Zsh to provide suggestions and auto-completion when writing Docker Buildx commands. These completions improve the user experience by reducing errors and increasing efficiency when working with multiple Docker contexts.'
