documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nix realisation info` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems, to provide detailed information about a specific realization, which refers to the actual instance of a Nix expression that has been built or configured. This command displays the evaluation history of the realization, its build outputs, status, and other related details. It''s often used for troubleshooting and understanding the lifecycle of Nix expressions.'
    flag:
        arg: |-
            [AI] `nix-realize` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The command `nix realize info --arg <argument>` is used to display detailed information about the realization of a specific Nix expression or configuration.

            The `--arg <argument>` option allows you to specify an argument to be passed to the realization process. This can be useful for debugging or understanding the behavior of complex configurations. The output will provide details about the dependencies, build inputs, and other relevant information related to the specified argument.
        argstr: '[AI] The `nix realisation info` command with the `--argstr` argument is used to display detailed information about a specific realization in the Nix Pakages Manager. A realization is the actual instance of a service or configuration managed by Nix, created based on a declared configuration in a Nix expression or profile. The `--argstr` flag allows passing arguments to the command that will be used when invoking the realization''s service or binary. This can be helpful for troubleshooting or understanding the exact arguments being passed when a service starts.'
        commit-lock-file: '[AI] The `nix realisation info --commit-lock-file` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command displays information about the commit lock file associated with a specific realization, which is a Nix expression that defines how to build or install a particular piece of software. The commit lock file ensures that multiple builds or installations do not conflict with each other by ensuring that only one build or installation process can use the latest version of the source code at a time. This command allows users to check the details of the commit lock file, such as its location and the hash of the committed source code.'
        debug: '[AI] The `flag "nix realization info --debug"` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command outputs detailed debug information about the current realization of a Nix expression or configuration. Realization refers to the instantiation of a Nix definition into actual files and directories on disk. The `--debug` flag increases the verbosity of the output, providing more information about the build and configuration process, which can be helpful for troubleshooting and understanding complex configurations.'
        debugger: '[AI] `flag "nix realization info --debugger"` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command displays debugging information about a specific realization, which is the Nix expression that defines how a given package should be built or installed. By adding the `--debugger` flag, more detailed information about the realization process is printed to the console, helping users to diagnose and troubleshoot issues related to their Nix configurations.'
        eval-store: '[AI] `nix realization info --eval-store` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The `realization info` subcommand displays information about the realizations (instantiations) of a specific Nix expression or configuration. The `--eval-store` flag instructs Nix to look up the realization in its eval store instead of building it from source. This can be useful when working with complex expressions or configurations that take a long time to build, as looking up an existing realization in the eval store is much faster.'
        impure: '[AI] `flag "nix realisation info --impure"` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command displays information about the impure realizations of a given expression. In Nix, realizations are instances of expressions that have been evaluated to produce actual files or resources. The `--impure` flag specifically requests information about realizations that depend on the environment or input variables, rather than the pure realizations derived solely from the expression itself. This command helps in debugging and understanding how Nix builds and manages its packages with respect to their dependencies.'
        include: '[AI] `flag "nix realization info --include"` is a command used in Nix Package Manager to retrieve detailed information about realizations, which are instances of a Nix expression or package. The `--include` flag expands the output to include information about dependencies and their versions, build inputs, and other configuration details. This flag helps in debugging and understanding the full implications of a Nix realization.'
        inputs-from: '[AI] The `nix realization info --inputs-from` command in Nix is used to display the build and derivation information for a specific Nix expression or file, including the inputs that were used to build it. These inputs represent the dependencies of the derivation, which are typically other Nix expressions or packages that need to be built before the current one can be constructed. The output includes the path to each input, its hash, and other relevant metadata. This command is useful for debugging dependency issues and understanding the build process in Nix.'
        json: '[AI] `flag "nix realisation info --json"` is a command in Nix Package Manager used to retrieve information about a specific realization (a Nix expression that evaluates to a package and its dependencies) in a JSON format. This can be helpful for scripting or automation tasks where data in a structured format is required. The output includes details such as the realization name, version, build inputs, and outputs.'
        log-format: |-
            [AI] The `nix realization info` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. When run with the `--log-format` option, it generates a log output of the realization process, which is the process by which Nix builds or fetches a specific software package or configuration.

            The log format includes various information such as the name of the realized item, its version number, the build or fetching status, timestamps, and any error messages if applicable. This output can be useful for debugging and understanding the details of the realization process. The exact format of the log is defined by Nix and can be customized using other options.
        no-registries: |-
            [AI] The `nix-realize` command is a utility in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. It builds and configures system services and applications managed by Nix from their declared configurations.

            The option `--no-registries` instructs `nix-realize` not to fetch new configurations from remote Nixpkgs or other Nix registry servers during the realization process. This means that only locally available configurations will be used, making the realization process faster and potentially more secure by avoiding network access.
        no-update-lock-file: '[AI] `nix-realize` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It downloads and compiles Nix expressions into native system packages, making them available for installation. The `--no-update-lock-file` option disables the creation of an update lock file during the realization process. Update lock files are used to prevent concurrent updates, ensuring consistency and avoiding conflicts. Without this option, multiple realizations can occur at the same time, which may result in inconsistencies or other issues. In some cases, disabling the update lock file might be beneficial for automated systems, where conflicts between concurrent realizations are not a concern.'
        no-write-lock-file: |-
            [AI] The `nix-realize` command is a part of Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It is used to update the system configuration by fetching and building packages defined in the Nix expression language.

            The option `--no-write-lock-file` prevents `nix-realize` from creating a write lock file in the Nix profile directory (usually located at `/nix/var/lib/nix/profile`). This can be useful when running multiple instances of `nix-realize` concurrently or on systems with limited resources, as it avoids contention for the lock file. However, using this option may result in inconsistent system state if other Nix processes are modifying the profile at the same time.
        override-flake: '[AI] `nix realization info --override-flake` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This command retrieves information about a specific Flake configuration, which is a new way to manage dependencies in Nix starting from version 2.3. The `--override-flake` option allows specifying an alternate Flake file overriding the default one in the project''s Git repository. The output provides details on the resolved dependency graph and the derived build inputs for the given Flake configuration.'
        override-input: '[AI] `flag "nix realization info --override-input"` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command displays detailed information about a specific realization, which is the instance of a Nix expression that has been evaluated to produce a particular output. The `--override-input` flag allows users to provide custom inputs or overrides for the inputs used in the realization process, enabling more fine-grained control and debugging.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] `nix realization info --print-build-logs` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command displays the build logs of a specific realization, which is the output generated during the construction process of a Nix expression. Realizations represent the built form of a Nix expression, including its dependencies and their build outputs. By using `--print-build-logs`, users can gain insight into the details of how a realization was built, helping to diagnose issues or understand the build process better.'
        quiet: '[AI] `nix-realize` is a command in Nix package manager used to update the system''s configuration by installing or upgrading packages and their dependencies, as well as managing their runtimes. The `--quiet` flag is an option that silences most of the output from this command, meaning it will run without displaying progress messages, success/failure notifications, or other verbose output. In summary, using `nix realize --quiet` runs the realization process with minimal output.'
        recreate-lock-file: |-
            [AI] The `nix-realize` command is a utility in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It is used to update system configurations managed by Nix.

            The `--recreate-lock-file` option tells `nix-realize` to recreate the lock file if it exists but is not valid anymore. A lock file is used to prevent concurrent modifications of the managed configurations to avoid conflicts or inconsistencies. If a lock file becomes invalid for some reason, running `nix-realize --recreate-lock-file` will try to create a new one before proceeding with the realization process. This can help in cases where the previous realization failed due to a locking issue.
        update-input: '[AI] The `flag "nix realisation info --update-input"` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command updates the input files of current realizations, which are instances of configurations that define how packages should be built or installed. By running this command, any changes made to the configuration files will be applied to the realizations. It helps ensure that packages are built or installed with the latest configurations.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flag "nix realization info --verbose"` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Un*x systems. This command displays detailed information about the current system configuration, including installed packages, their versions, and the sources they were downloaded from. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output provided, giving a more comprehensive view of the current Nix setup.'
