    command: '[AI] The `vagrant box` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command is responsible for managing and downloading Vagrant boxes, which are pre-configured templates containing the operating system, application server, and any necessary software or settings. By using a specific box with a `vagrant init` or `vagrant up` command, you can quickly set up a new virtual machine instance with the desired configuration.'
