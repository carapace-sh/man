documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `light` command is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It might refer to specific commands or configurations used in graphics rendering, 3D modeling software, or other specialized contexts. For general-purpose Linux systems, there is no built-in `light` command.'
    flag:
        A: '[AI] The `-A` option when using the `light` command in Linux is used to merge all lightweight processes into their parent process. This means that the output of the `ps auxf` or similar commands with the `-A` flag will show all processes and their ancestors chained together as a single tree, making it easier to view the hierarchy of processes.'
        G: '[AI] The `-G` option in GNU `find` command is used to follow symbolic links when searching for files or directories. When you use `find . -G` in a directory, it will search recursively, including any symbolic links it encounters, and report the files or directories found under those symbolic links as if they were in the original location.'
        I: '[AI] The `-I` option in the `light` command of the Lightweight File System Tools (LFS) is used to specify one or more directories as additional include paths for the compilation process during file system creation. This can be useful when building custom file systems that require headers or libraries located outside of the default search path. The format is `-I <directory>`. Multiple directories can be specified by adding multiple `-I` options.'
        L: '[AI] The `-L` option in GNU `find` command with `light` as the command before it, is used to follow symbolic links only when looking for files or directories. In other words, this option allows finding files and directories that are symbolically linked to other files or directories but does not follow regular (hard) links. This can be useful in cases where you want to find files based on their symbolic link names or paths while excluding the actual files they point to.'
        "N": '[AI] The `flag "light-N"` is specific to GNU `find` command. It''s used to set the maximum number of concurrent processes (threads) for parallel execution. With this flag, you can limit the number of threads `find` uses when searching directories recursively. For instance, `find . -type f -maxdepth 3 -print0 | xargs -0 -P 4 -I {} lightgallery --src-quiet={} --no-autoplay -c ../path/to/thumbnails/ --slide-width=250 --slide-height=187 --progress --pause-on-interact --wrap-around 3: true:` in the command above, `light-4` sets a limit to four threads.'
        O: '[AI] The `-O` flag in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is used to enable various optimizations during compilation. It stands for "optimize." When you use `-O` flag, GCC applies several optimizations to the source code aiming at improving the performance of the resulting binary by reducing the execution time and/or increasing the code size efficiency. The level of optimization can be controlled with additional flags such as `-O1`, `-O2`, or `-O3`. The higher the optimization level, the more aggressive the compiler is in optimizing the code. However, it may also increase the compilation time and, in some cases, introduce additional errors or incompatibilities with certain systems.'
        P: '[AI] The `flag "light -P"` in Unix-like operating systems, specifically in the `light` command, is used to specify that `light` should read its configuration file from a centralized location rather than from a user-specific file. The `-P` stands for "centralized" or "system-wide". This flag can be helpful in managing configurations consistently across multiple instances of a system.'
        S: '[AI] The `-S` option in the `light` command of the systemd init system is used to show information about the dependencies and requirements of a given service or target. When run with this option, `systemd` will output a tree diagram displaying the hierarchical relationships between different units (services, targets, etc.), helping to visualize their dependencies and understand how they affect each other at start-up.'
        T: '[AI] The `-T` option in the `light` command is used to specify that the input file is in TSV (Tab-Separated Values) format instead of CSV (Comma-Separated Values). When this option is used, `light` reads and processes data from the input file accordingly, using tabs as separators between columns. This is particularly useful when dealing with data that uses tabs to separate values instead of commas.'
        U: '[AI] The `-U` option in GNU `find` command with `light` as the first argument is used to request that `find` follow symbolic links, but do not change working directory when following the links. This means that `find` will search both the current directory and the directories pointed to by the symbolic links, treating them as if they were the actual physical directories. The `light` argument is usually used with this option to reduce the amount of disk I/O when searching large file hierarchies.'
        V: '[AI] The `-v` flag when used with the `git` command `light`, specifically `git log --version` or `git version --version`, is used to display the version and other related information of Git itself, including its compilation settings, such as operating system, hostname, etc. It provides a more detailed output than just using `git --version`.'
        r: '[AI] `licht r` is a command in the Git version control system. The `-r` option stands for "recursive," and the entire command, `light -r`, requests a recursive file status report. This means it will display the current state of all files in your repository, including those in subdirectories. It provides detailed information such as modified files, new files, deleted files, and untracked files.'
        s: '[AI] The `light-s` flag is a command-line option for the `light` utility in Linux systems. It stands for "simple" or "summary" format and is used to display system information in a concise and easy-to-read output. This includes details about the system''s memory usage, loaded kernel modules, running processes, network interfaces, and other relevant data. The flag is particularly useful when quick checks are required without delving into excessive detail.'
        v: |-
            [AI] The `flag "light-v"` is not a standard command or flag in Unix or Linux environments. It seems to be specific to a particular software tool called `light`, which is not widely used.

            The `-v` flag is a common verbose flag used in many Unix and Linux commands. When used, it increases the amount of output and provides more detailed information about the command's execution. For example, when using `git -v`, it displays the version information of Git. In general, the usage and effect of the `-v` flag depend on the specific command or tool that it is being used with.

            Regarding the `light` command, based on the limited information available, its `-v` flag might provide more detailed output about the commands being executed by the tool. For more precise information, refer to the documentation of the `light` tool.
