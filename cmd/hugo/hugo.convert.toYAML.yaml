description: Convert front matter to YAML
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `hugo convert toYAML` command is not a standard Hugo command. Hugo is a static site generator written in Go, and it doesn''t have a built-in command for converting files to YAML format. If you meant to ask about converting Hugo theme or content files to YAML format, you would typically need to write a script or use an external tool for the conversion. For instance, you could use `yaml` package in Go, or tools like `js-yaml`, `python-yaml`, etc., depending on your input and output file formats.'
