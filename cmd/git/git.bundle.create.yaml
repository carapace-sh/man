documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git bundle create` is a Git command used to create a bundled history, also known as a Git archive or bundle. This command allows you to pack an entire repository (including all branches and commits) into a single file. The resulting bundle can be transferred over the network or stored offline for later use. When you apply the bundle using `git bundle apply`, it extracts the packed history back into a new Git repository.'
    flag:
        all-progress: '[AI] `git bundle create` is a Git command used to create a bundled history, which is an archive of a Git repository at a specific point in time. The `--all-progress` option, when used with this command, creates a bundle that includes all branches and their entire commit history up to the current tip of each branch. This option generates a single bundle file containing the complete history of all branches in the source repository, making it easy to transfer the full project history to another location or share it with others.'
        all-progress-implied: '[AI] `git bundle create` is a Git command used to create a bundled representation of a repository, allowing the data to be transferred over a network or stored offline. The option `--all` implies that all branches in the source repository should be included in the bundle, while `--progress-implied` automatically adds a progress bar during the bundle creation process. So, in simple terms, `git bundle create --all-progress-implied` creates a Git bundle containing all branches with a visible progress bar during the creation process.'
        progress: '[AI] `git bundle create` is a Git command used to create a bundled representation of a repository or a portion of it, which can be easily transferred over a non-networked transport medium like a USB stick or sent via email. The `--progress` option provides real-time progress updates during the bundle creation process, allowing users to monitor its status. In essence, it creates a Git archive with all the necessary metadata and history, and generates a bundled file that can be shared with others without requiring network access.'
        quiet: '[AI] `git bundle create` is a Git command used to create a bundled representation of a repository, including its entire history and all branches and tags. The `--quiet` option makes Git run silently, without displaying any progress messages during the operation. This can be useful for automating tasks or when running Git in non-interactive environments.'
        version: '[AI] The `git bundle create` command is used to create a Git bundle, which is an archive containing a complete history of commits and all the required objects for a Git repository. The `--version` option that follows this command specifies that only the specified Git bundle format version should be used when creating the bundle. This means that the created bundle will only be compatible with Git versions that support the specified bundle format version. For example, using `git bundle create --version=2 mybundle.bund` will create a Git bundle in version 2 format. This command does not actually display the version number in the output; instead, it ensures that the created bundle adheres to the specified bundle format version.'
