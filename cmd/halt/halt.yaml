documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `halt` command is used to stop or halt a computer system or virtual machine, causing an orderly shutdown of all running processes. It sends a signal to the operating system to initiate the shutdown sequence, saving any unsaved data and terminating all active applications before powering off or rebooting the system. The exact method for using `halt` may depend on the specific operating system or virtualization platform being used.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The `halt --force` command is a Linux utility used to stop or power off a system immediately, bypassing any pre-shutdown scripts or confirmations. It sends the SIGTERM signal followed by the SIGKILL signal to all processes and then initiates the shutdown sequence. This command should be used with caution as it does not allow for a graceful shutdown of running processes.'
        halt: '[AI] The `halt` command with the `--halt` option is used to bring a system to a complete halt. This means that all processes are stopped, and the system power is turned off or left in a state of minimal power consumption. The `--halt` flag ensures that the system performs a clean shutdown before reaching this halt state, which helps prevent data corruption and other issues. It''s often used to perform hardware maintenance or for troubleshooting purposes.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `halt --help` command is used in various Unix-like operating systems and virtualization platforms like VirtualBox, to display help information about the `halt` utility. The `halt` command is typically used to gracefully shut down a system or bring it to a halt (stop all processes).

            The `--help` option provides a brief explanation of the available options and their usage for the `halt` command. It usually includes information on how to use the command to halt, power off, or reboot a system, as well as any necessary arguments or flags that may be required. This helps users understand how to properly execute the `halt` command in different scenarios.
        no-wall: '[AI] The `halt --no-wall` command in a Linux environment is used to halt (stop) the running system in an emergency situation. The `--no-wall` flag is an optional argument that instructs the system not to display the shutdown message on the terminal or on the console of each connected device, for security reasons or to avoid unwanted attention. In summary, it halts the system silently without displaying a wall message.'
        no-wtmp: '[AI] The `halt` command with the `--no-wtmp` option is used to shut down a Linux system in a way that does not update the `wtmp` and `lastlog` files. These files keep records of user login sessions, providing useful information for system administration and troubleshooting. By using the `--no-wtmp` flag, these logs are not modified during the shutdown process. This can be desirable in specific situations where maintaining an uninterrupted log history is not a priority, such as when performing system maintenance or troubleshooting tasks that might involve multiple reboots.'
        poweroff: '[AI] The `halt --poweroff` command is a Linux system command used to perform an orderly shutdown of a system and then power off the hardware. The `--poweroff` option signifies that the power should be physically turned off at the end of the shutdown process. This command initiates a sequence of events that stops all running processes, saves open files, closes opened network connections, and eventually halts the system. Once halted, the power is off, resulting in a complete power down of the computer.'
        reboot: '[AI] The `halt --reboot` command is a Linux utility used to halt (bring a system to a complete stop) and then automatically restart it. The `--reboot` option initiates the reboot process after the system has been halted. This command is typically used for system maintenance tasks or updates, where it''s necessary to shut down a system completely and then bring it back up. It''s important to note that all running processes will be terminated during this operation.'
