    command: '[AI] `flatpak permissions` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to manage application permissions. It allows users to view, grant, or revoke permissions for installed Flatpak applications. The exact usage depends on the specific subcommand used with this command. For example, `flatpak permissions --list` displays a list of all available permissions and which applications have been granted them. Other subcommands include `grant` (to give an application a permission) and `revoke` (to remove a permission from an application).'

            This is the basic structure of the command followed by its usage and available options:

            Usage: `{commands}` can be one of: 'list', 'allow', or 'deny'.

            Options:
            1. `--app <APP_ID>` or `<APP_ID>`: The ID of the Flatpak application.
            2. `--user <USER>` or `--system`: The scope (user or system).
            3. `--help` or `-h`: Display available options and exit.
            4. `--json` or `-j`: Output in JSON format.
            5. `--no-ask`: Don't prompt for user confirmation.

            The 'list', 'allow', and 'deny' commands allow managing runtime permissions for Flatpak applications on a given scope (user or system). For example, `flatpak permissions list <APP_ID> --user` will display the current runtime permissions for the specified application in the user context.

        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak permissions --ostree-verbose` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment platform, to manage application permissions related to the OSTREE file system. This verbose flag enhances the output of the command, providing more detailed information about the specific OSTREE file system transactions being granted or revoked to and from Flatpak applications. Essentially, it offers a clearer understanding of how application access to files is being modified.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak permissions` is a command-line utility for Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system. The `--verbose` option is used to increase the amount of output produced by the command. When you run `flatpak permissions --verbose`, it displays detailed information about the current application permissions, including the applications that have requested permissions, the specific permissions they''ve requested, and the status of those requests (granted or denied). This can be helpful for understanding the permissions landscape on your system and troubleshooting any permission-related issues.'
