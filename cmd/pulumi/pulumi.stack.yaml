flags:
    --show-name: Display only the stack name
    --show-secrets: Display stack outputs which are marked as secret in plaintext
    -i, --show-ids: Display each resource's provider-assigned unique ID
    -u, --show-urns: Display each resource's Pulumi-assigned globally unique URN
persistentflags:

documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pulumi stack` is a command provided by Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform, used to manage and switch between multiple stacks or environments (e.g., development, staging, production) within the same project. It helps in managing resources at different stages of the deployment pipeline, making it easier to manage and deploy resources consistently across various environments.'
    flag:
        show-ids: '[AI] `pulumi stack show-ids` is a command used in Pulumi, an infrastructure as code tool. This command displays the IDs of the stacks (logical groups of resources) configured in your Pulumi project. The output includes the stack name and its associated unique ID, which can be useful for identifying and managing specific stacks within your organization.'
        show-name: '[AI] The `pulumi stack show-name` command is used in Pulumi, a cloud infrastructure platform as code, to display the name of the currently active Stack. A Stack in Pulumi represents a collection of related resources that are deployed and managed together. When you run `stack show-name`, Pulumi will output the name of the current Stack, which can be helpful for confirming which resources are being managed by the currently selected deployment.'
        show-secrets: '[AI] `pulumi stack show-secsrets` is a command provided by Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform. This command displays the encrypted secrets stored in the Pulumi state file for the selected stack without decrypting or exposing them in plaintext. It helps maintain security by keeping encrypted secrets hidden while providing visibility into which secrets are being used within the infrastructure configuration.'
        show-urns: '[AI] `pulumi stack --show-urns` is a command provided by Pulumi, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform, that displays the URNs (Uniform Resource Names) of all resources in a given stack. A URN uniquely identifies each resource type and instance within a Pulumi project, and includes the registry, namespace, and resource name. This command helps in understanding the dependencies between resources and managing them effectively across multiple environments.'
