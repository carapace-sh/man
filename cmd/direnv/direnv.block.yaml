        [AI] `direnv block` is a Direnv command used to create new configuration blocks for managing environment variables across different projects or directories. It lets you define and activate custom environment variables, which can be useful when working with multiple environments or tools that require specific settings.

        When you create a new file with the name starting with `.direnv` (e.g., `.direnv.local`) in your project directory, its content will be treated as a Direnv configuration block. The command `direnv allow` is used to activate these blocks, making their environment variables available in your shell when you navigate into that directory.
