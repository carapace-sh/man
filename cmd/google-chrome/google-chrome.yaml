documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `google-chrome` command is used to open Google Chrome, a popular web browser developed by Google. When entered in a terminal or command prompt on an operating system where Google Chrome is installed, this command launches an instance of the browser. If no arguments are provided with the command, it opens a new blank tab in the browser.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `--app` flag is a command-line argument for Google Chrome browser. When used, it starts Chrome in app mode, which means it opens a window with only the specified application and hides the browser chrome (address bar, tabs, etc.). This can be useful for running web applications full screen or in a kiosk mode setting.'
        new-window: '[AI] `google-chrome --new-window` is a command-line argument for Google Chrome browser. It opens a new window when you launch or run the browser using this command instead of opening a new tab in an existing window. This can be useful when you want to open multiple windows with different websites or applications at the same time.'
        no-proxy-server: '[AI] The command `google-chrome --no-proxy-server` is used to open Google Chrome browser without using a proxy server. When you access the web using this command, Chrome will directly connect to websites, bypassing any proxy servers that may be configured in your system or network settings. This can be useful for troubleshooting network issues or accessing restricted content. Note that Google Chrome itself must not be configured to use a specific proxy server for this command to take effect.'
        password-store: |-
            [AI] The `--password-store` flag in Google Chrome is used to specify the location where Chrome should store or load passwords from. By default, Chrome stores passwords in its local encrypted database on the user's device. However, this flag can be used to change that behavior:

            * `--password-store=chrome` (default): Store and use passwords in Chrome's local database.
            * `--password-store=basic`: Use a simple text file for storing and loading passwords. This is less secure as the file is not encrypted.
            * `--password-store=file=<path>`: Use a custom file for storing and loading passwords. The specified path should be an accessible location on the user's device.

            This flag can be useful for administrators or users who want to manage their passwords centrally, in a shared environment, or when troubleshooting synchronization issues.
        proxy-auto-detect: '[AI] `--proxy-auto-detect` is a command-line argument for Google Chrome browser. It enables the browser to automatically detect and use a proxy server from the system''s configuration, such as a proxy set in your operating system or network settings. This can be useful when accessing the internet through a corporate or institutional network that requires a proxy for browsing.'
        proxy-pac-url: '[AI] The `--proxy-pac-url` flag in Google Chrome is used to specify a Proxy Automatic Configuration (PAC) file URL. A PAC file is a text document that defines proxy rules for various network conditions and destinations, allowing for dynamic proxy configuration. By setting this flag during the launch of Chrome, you can apply specific proxy rules to the browser, making it useful in enterprise environments where network traffic routing is tightly controlled.'
        proxy-server: '[AI] The `--proxy-server` flag is a command-line argument for Google Chrome web browser. It is used to configure the browser to use a proxy server before connecting to the internet. A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and the internet, allowing various functionalities such as caching, access control, and anonymity. By providing a proxy server address and port with this flag (e.g., `--proxy-server="myproxy:8080"`, or `--proxy-server="socks5://username:password@host:port"`, for SOCKS5 proxies), Chrome will route its web traffic through the specified proxy before accessing websites, enabling users to apply specific settings or restrictions when browsing.'
        user-data-dir: '[AI] The `--user-data-dir` flag is a command-line option for Google Chrome browser. It specifies the directory where user-specific data, such as cookies, bookmarks, and local storage, will be stored. By default, this data is saved in hidden directories under the user''s home directory on most operating systems. However, using this flag allows users to specify a different location or create multiple profiles with separate data directories. This can be useful for testing, isolation, or organizational purposes.'
        version: '[AI] `google-chrome --version` is a command used in the terminal or command prompt to display the version number of Google Chrome browser installed on your system. It''s part of Google Chrome''s portable execution capabilities, allowing users to check for updates or troubleshoot issues by knowing their current browser version.'
