    command: '[AI] `gh codespace view` is a GitHub CLI (git-hub) command that allows users to view details about their active GitHubCodespaces, including the status of the environment, associated repository, and running workloads. It helps in monitoring and managing your remote development environments directly from the command line.'
    flag:
        jq: '[AI] `gh codespace view` is a command provided by GitHub''s CLI tool (`gh`) to manage and interact with GitHub Codespaces, which are lightweight, ephemeral development environments for working on projects directly in the cloud. The `--jq` flag is an option used to pipe the output of the command through `jq`, a lightweight and flexible data processor written in JSON. With this combination, you can manipulate and transform the JSON-formatted output from `gh codespace view` using `jq` queries to extract specific information or modify its structure.'
        json: '[AI] `gh codespace view --json` is a command used with the GitHub CLI (gh) to retrieve information about GitHub CodeSpaces in JSON format. CodeSpaces are ephemeral environments that can be used to build, test, and run code. The `--json` flag instructs gh to output the response as JSON data, allowing for easier processing and manipulation of the information.'
        template: '[AI] `gh codespace view --template` is a command from GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, gh, used to create or open a new GitHub CodeSpace - an interactive development environment for your projects directly in the GitHub web IDE. The `--template` flag specifies a GitHub Repository containing a .devcontainer.json file that defines the settings for the environment, such as the language, runtime, extensions, and other dependencies. This command sets up a new CodeSpace instance with the specified template configuration, allowing you to start coding right away.'
