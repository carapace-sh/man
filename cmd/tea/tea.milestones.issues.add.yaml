        [AI] The `tea milestones issues add` command is used in the GitLab CI/CD pipeline tool, specifically with the GitLab Runner's Tea integrated testing framework, to associate an issue with a specific milestone. It adds the given issue number(s) to one or more specified milestones. The syntax for this command includes the project name, the GitLab runner token (for authentication), the branch or tag containing the changes, and the list of issues and milestones to be linked. An example would look like:

        ```bash
        tea_milestones:
          image: gitlab/gitlab-runner:alpine
          script: |
            export GITLAB_TOKEN=<runner_token>
            export ISSUES="31 57"
            export MILESTONES="milestone1 milestone2"
            tea issues add <project_namespace>/<project_name>.git --issues $ISSUES --milestones $MILESTONES
        ```

        Replace `<runner_token>`, `<project_namespace>`, `<project_name>`, `$ISSUES`, and `$MILESTONES` with the appropriate values. This command is typically used in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline script to automate the association of issues with milestones as part of a testing or release process.

            [AI] The command `tea milestones issues add --login` is related to the Tea API, a tool for interacting with GitHub's project management features using the command line.

            This specific command can be broken down as follows:

            1. `tea`: This is the name of the command-line application for working with GitHub's Tea API.
            2. `milestones`: This is the subcommand used to manage milestones, which are targets for groups of related work in a project.
            3. `issues`: This is another subcommand used to manage issues, which are individual work items within a project.
            4. `add`: This verb indicates that we want to add something new using this command.
            5. `--login`: This option instructs the Tea CLI to open a login page in your default web browser so you can log in to your GitHub account, allowing the command to access your repositories and data.
        output: '[AI] The command `tea milestones issues add --output` is used in the Tea project management tool to create a new milestone and add an issue or issues to it. The `--output` flag specifies that the output of the command should be in a particular format, such as JSON or YAML, for further processing by other tools or scripts.'
        remote: |-
            [AI] The `--remote` option in the Git command `git fetch --all --prune --unshallow --recurse-submodules --tags --remote <remote_name> tea milestones issues add` is used to specify a remote repository as the source for fetching new commits, branches, and tags.

            The other options in this command are related to common Git tasks:

            * `--all` fetches all branches from the remote.
            * `--prune` removes any local branches that have been deleted on the remote.
            * `--unshallow` converts a working directory into a bare repository if it was cloned as a shallow clone.
            * `--recurse-submodules` fetches submodules recursively.
            * `--tags` fetches all tags from the remote.

            The `tea milestones issues add` part of the command likely refers to adding references to specific issues or milestones in the Git project management tool, such as GitHub or GitLab, to the commits being fetched. This would allow users to easily track and reference specific work in their project.
        repo: '[AI] The `--repo` option in the `tea milestones issues add` command is used to specify the GitHub repository where you want to create or link a new issue or milestone, in the context of the Tea CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for GitHub. This means that instead of providing the full repository URL each time you add an issue or milestone, you can simply set the `--repo` flag with the desired repository name to make the command more concise and efficient.'
