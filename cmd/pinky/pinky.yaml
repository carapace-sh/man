documentation:
    command: '[AI] The term "pinky" is a colloquialism referring to the smallest finger on the hand. It derives from its pink color compared to the other fingers. In computing or technology context, there is no such command named "pinky".'
    flag:
        b: '[AI] The `-b` option in a command or script context often refers to specifying binary mode when dealing with file I/O. With the flag `pinky`, there seems to be a misconfiguration as this term is not associated with any standard Unix or Linux command or flag. It''s essential to check the documentation of the specific tool or application using the term "pinky" and its `-b` flag for accurate information.'
        f: |-
            [AI] The `-f` flag, also known as the "force" flag, is a common option used in various command-line tools and utilities, including those found in Unix-based operating systems like Pinky. It is typically used to override warnings or force an operation to continue even if it might result in loss of data or other undesirable consequences.

            When the `-f` flag is employed, the tool will bypass any prompts or confirmations that would normally ask for user input before performing potentially risky actions. This can be useful when running automated scripts or when the user is confident that they want to proceed without interruption. However, it's essential to exercise caution and thoroughly understand the implications of using this flag, as it can lead to irreversible data loss if misused.
        h: '[AI] The command `pinky -h` is not a standard Unix or Linux command, as there''s no widely-used tool called "pinky" with that option in their default installations. If you meant to refer to a specific software package named "pinky," please provide more context about it. In the general case, the `-h` option is typically used to display help or usage information for a command or utility.'
        help: '[AI] The `--help` option is a common command-line argument used in various programs, including the `pinky` tool. When you run `pinky --help`, the command displays detailed information about how to use the tool, including available commands and options, their meanings, and usage examples. It''s a convenient way for users to quickly learn about a program''s functionality without having to refer to external documentation or remember specific details.'
        i: '[AI] The command `pinky -i` is not a standard Unix or Linux command and its meaning is not universally defined. It appears to be specific to the Pinky data exploration tool, which is used for interacting with large datasets in a graphical way. The option `-i` with this command may indicate an interactive mode or invoke an interface for inputting queries or commands directly into the Pinky application. For more precise information, refer to the Pinky documentation.'
        l: '[AI] The `pinky -l` command is not a standard Unix or Linux command. It seems to be specific to an unknown tool or software named "pinky." A more common Unix command with similar meaning is `ls -l`, which lists files in long format, displaying detailed information such as file size, permission bits, owner, group, and modification time.'
        p: '[AI] The `pinky` command with the `-p` flag is a Unix utility used for parsing and processing shell scripts or other text files. Specifically, the `-p` option tells `pinky` to process each script or file in place, meaning it modifies the original file instead of creating a new output file. This can be useful when working with small changes to existing configuration files or scripts.'
        q: '[AI] The `pinky -q` command is not a standard Unix or Linux command. It seems to be specific to Pinky, a data processing tool developed by Quantopian for creating custom algorithms in algorithmic trading. The `-q` option is used to quiet the output of Pinky, meaning it will suppress informational messages and display only error messages if any occur during the execution of the Pinky script.'
        s: '[AI] The `-s` option when used with Git''s `checkout`, `merge`, or `revert` commands, tells Git to perform the operation in a "safe" or "ours" mode. When you use this option along with a branch or commit name followed by `-s`, it will keep your working directory and index unchanged if there are any merge conflicts during the operation. The term "pinky" is not related to this flag; it seems to be a typo in your question.'
        version: '[AI] `pinky --version` is a command used in Unix-based systems to check the version information of an installed application called Pinky, if it exists. When executed in a terminal or command prompt, this command displays the name of the application along with its version number. This can help users verify they have the latest or desired version of Pinky installed and running on their system.'
        w: '[AI] The `pinky` command is a part of the `GNU Core Utilities`, specifically it''s a text filter. The option `-w` that follows `pinky` is used to perform a width-limited search in the input files. With this option, `pinky` will output only those lines that match the search pattern up to the specified width. For instance, if you use `pinky -w 10 my_pattern file.txt`, it would print only the first 10 characters of each line in `file.txt` containing the string `my_pattern`.'
