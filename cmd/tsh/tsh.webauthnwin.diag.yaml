        [AI] `tsh webauthnwin diag` is a command used in the Tenable Security Center (TSC) platform, specifically within the Tenable.sc Web Application Scanning (WAS) component. This command generates a diagnostic report for issues related to WebAuthn (Web Authentication), a modern authentication standard that provides strong authentication with public key cryptography for clients capable of using it.

        The `diag` argument instructs the tool to produce a detailed diagnostic output, which may include information such as affected URLs, vulnerability details, remediation advice, and other contextual data. The report is usually saved as a file in a specified location or can be displayed directly in the TSC console for further analysis.
