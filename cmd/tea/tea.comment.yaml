documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "tee" is a utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems used to read from standard input, and write that input to files or pipes while also displaying it on the terminal. The command "tee comment" doesn''t exist. However, you can use the command "tee -a <filename> <input>" to append text (<input>) to a file named "<filename>" and display it in real-time on the terminal. If you want to add a comment while piping input to tee, you would include it before or after the input, for example: "echo ''This is a comment'' | tee -a <filename>".'
    flag:
        login: '[AI] The `--login` flag is used with the `docker-compose` command for managing multi-container Docker applications. When this flag is passed, Docker Compose will create and configure a new container for the service that has been defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Additionally, it will perform an automated login to the container using SSH keys or a password, if specified, allowing for remote access to the container''s shell. This flag is useful when you need to run a container in detached mode with persistent data and want to maintain long-term access to the container.'
        output: '[AI] The `--output` flag is an option used with some Git commands, including `git fetch` and `git pull`, to specify where the output of the command should be written. When used with `tee`, which is a separate Unix command, it redirects the command output to both the terminal and a file specified by the argument following `--output`. For instance, `git pull origin master --output=log.txt` would perform a git pull and save the output to a file named "log.txt".'
        remote: '[AI] The `--remote tea comment` is an argument used with Git''s `push` command. It specifies that changes should be pushed to a remote repository, and that there is a branch named ''tea'' with commit messages containing the word ''comment''. This allows pushing commits to the ''tea'' branch of the remote repository without having to name each commit explicitly.'
        repo: '[AI] The command `git teasingly-comment --repo <repository-url>` is not a standard Git flag or command. It seems to be a custom command created using Git''s `git-teeinglingly-comment` script, which is not a built-in Git command. This command might be designed for adding a comment to a specific file in a Git repository and sharing it with others, possibly through a URL specified by `<repository-url>`. The exact behavior would depend on how the script is implemented.'
