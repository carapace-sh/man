        [AI] `volta` is a tool for managing and installing Node.js projects and their dependencies. The `uninstall` command is used to remove a specific project or global package installed with Volta. The basic usage is:

        ```
        volta uninstall <project-name>
        ```

        or

        ```
        volta uninstall <global-package-name>
        ```

        This command removes the specified project or global package, including its dependencies, from your system. It's important to note that using `uninstall` will permanently delete the installation and cannot be undone. Always double check before running this command.

            [AI] The `volta uninstall` command is used to remove Volta, a global tool manager for JavaScript projects, from your system. The `--help` flag provides detailed information about how to use this command, including its syntax and available options. Here's what the help output might look like:

            ```sh
            USAGE: volta uninstall [OPTIONS] [NAME]

            Remove Volta from the current project or globally.

            Arguments:
              NAME           Name of the tool to be uninstalled (optional). If not provided, will
                            remove Volta entirely.

            Options:
              -g, --global     Uninstall Volta globally instead of just for the current project.
              --help          Print this help message and exit.
            ```

            The `--help` flag shows that this command can take an optional argument, which is the name of a specific tool to uninstall instead of Volta itself. The command also has an optional `-g` or `--global` flag, which allows you to uninstall Volta from your entire system rather than just the current project.
