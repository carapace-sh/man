documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "tea issues" is not a standard command in any known operating system or programming language. It appears to be a misspelled or ambiguous term, possibly meant to refer to problems or difficulties related to the beverage "tea." Without further context, it''s impossible to determine the specific meaning or intended use of this command.'
    flag:
        assignee: '[AI] The `--assignee` flag in the context of Jira or similar project management tools is used to specify a particular user as the assignee of an issue, meaning the person responsible for completing the task represented by that issue. In the phrase "tea issues --assignee," it''s likely that "tea" refers to a set or group of issues, and the flag `--assignee` is indicating which user should be assigned to work on those specific issues.'
        author: '[AI] The "tea issues --author" flag is used in Git, a version control system. When running the `git blame` command with this flag, it will display the author information for each committed line change in the file being inspected. This can help identify who made specific changes and when they were made.'
        comments: '[AI] The flag "--comments" when used with a Git command like "git diff --name-only --cached --diff-filter=d --local --teasurer" will show only the filenames with comments changed in a Git repository. The "--teasurer" flag is not a standard Git flag and assumes you''re using an extension or custom script named ''teasurer''. This script likely helps manage some aspect of your project using Git and this specific combination of flags would be used to identify which files have had comment changes made in the staging area.'
        fields: |-
            [AI] The `--fields` option used with the `tea issues` command in GitLab is used to limit the output of the command to only specific fields or columns of data. For example, if you want to see only the issue ID, title, and assignee for a set of issues, you can use the following command:

            ```sh
            tea issues --fields ID,Title,Assignee
            ```

            This will return a JSON response containing only those three fields for each issue. If no `--fields` option is provided, all available fields will be returned by default.
        from: '[AI] The `--from` option in the `tea issues` command is used to specify a reference point or a starting point for comparing changes between two branches or commits in the TEA (Tracing Every Action) version control system. This allows users to identify and review differences between different versions of their codebase. For example, you can use `tea issues list --from=<commit-hash>` to show the differences between the current branch and a specific commit.'
        keyword: '[AI] The term "tea issues --keyword" likely refers to a search query or filter used in data analysis related to the tea industry. "Tea issues" could signify any problems or challenges faced by the tea sector, while "--keyword" represents a specific keyword or term to be searched or analyzed within that context. For example, this might include searching for mentions of particular diseases affecting tea plants, changes in market prices, or government regulations impacting tea production. Overall, it''s an instruction to focus on issues pertaining to the tea industry with a given keyword as a parameter.'
        kind: '[AI] The `--kind` flag in the context of tea issues refers to specifying the type or category of the issue when reporting or diagnosing problems related to tea. For instance, it could be used to indicate the type of tea (black, green, oolong, etc.), the brewing method, water temperature, steeping time, or other relevant factors that may affect the tea''s taste, aroma, or appearance. The flag helps provide more context and accuracy when addressing tea-related concerns.'
        labels: '[AI] The `--labels` flag is used with Kubernetes `kubectl` command for managing labels on objects such as pods, services, or namespaces. When you run a command like `kubectl label <resource> --labels="key=value"`, it sets the specified label key-value pair(s) on the resource. If you want to list all labels on an object, you can use `--labels-all-names` or `--show-labels` flags with `kubectl describe`. The `--labels` flag is also useful when applying multiple labels at once by providing multiple key=value pairs separated by commas. For example: `kubectl label <resource> --labels="key1=value1, key2=value2"`.'
        limit: '[AI] The `--limit` option in the context of the "tea issues" command is used to specify a maximum number of results to return when querying or listing issues in a GitHub or GitLab project using a client like `git tea`. By default, most such commands will return all matching results. Adding `--limit N` sets the limit to the first N results only. This can be useful for quickly reviewing a small set of issues without having to sift through an extensive list.'
        login: '[AI] The command "tea issues --login" is not a flag, but rather a combination of a tool called "tea," which is used for encryption and decryption, and options passed to it. In this case, the "--login" option indicates that the command relates to logging in using tea for secure communication. The exact function would depend on how tea is configured and set up for use.'
        mentions: '[AI] The "tea issues --mentions" flag is a command-line option used with the Git version control system. It is specifically used when running a Git blame or log command to filter results by lines containing specific text related to "tea issues." When this flag is included, Git will only display changesets that include modifications to lines containing that text in the files being inspected.'
        milestones: '[AI] The `--milestones` flag for the `tea issues` command is used in the TestAutomationEngine (TAE) tool within the Tea Project framework. This flag instructs TAE to display only the milestones, or significant points of progress, for the specified issue(s) during test execution. It helps provide an overview of the testing process and highlights major events related to those issues.'
        output: '[AI] The `--output` flag in the `tea issues` command is used to specify an output format when working with Tea, a popular CLI tool for GitHub issues management. Without this flag, the output of the command would be displayed in the terminal by default. By using `--output json`, for instance, the results will be returned in JSON format, which can then be easily processed and parsed by other applications or scripts.'
        page: |-
            [AI] The `--page` option in the `tea issues` command is used to limit the output to a specific number of issues or pages. When using this option, `tea issues` will display only the specified number of issues per page instead of showing all the issues at once. The default number of issues displayed per page is usually 20. To use this option, simply include the `--page` flag followed by the desired number as an argument when running the command, for example:

            ```bash
            tea issues --page 3
            ```

            This would display issues starting from the third page (note that the first page is indexed at 1).
        remote: '[AI] The `--remote` flag in the `tea issues` command is used with the TEA CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for GitHub projects. It specifies that the issues should be fetched from a remote repository instead of the local one. In other words, it tells TEA to retrieve the list of issues from a different GitHub repository rather than the current working directory.'
        repo: '[AI] The command `tea issues --repo` is used with the Tea tool, which is a Git client for Terminal. This command specifically displays the list of open issues in a given Git repository. The `--repo` flag indicates that the user intends to specify a particular repository''s issues, and not their global list of repositories or a specific project within a repository.'
        state: '[AI] The `--state tea issues` flag is a command-line argument used in various tools, especially those related to infrastructure management with Terraform by Hashicorp. It instructs Terraform to only show information about the specified "tea issues" or resource instances that have a non-zero exit status or an error during the last apply. This flag can be helpful in troubleshooting failed resources, providing a clearer view of the problematic infrastructure components and their associated error messages.'
        until: '[AI] The `--until` option in the `tea issues` command is used to show issues up to a specific point in time. When using this option, you provide a date or commit hash as an argument, and the command will display all open issues that were created before the given point. This can be useful for reviewing the issue history up to a certain milestone or release.'
