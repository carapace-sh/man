        [AI] The command `yarn npm whoami` is actually a combination of two different commands used in Node.js projects managed with Yarn package manager.

        The first part, `npm`, is a reference to Node Package Manager, which is a default package manager for Node.js. The `whoami` command is a built-in npm script that returns the name of the currently logged-in user.

        When you run `yarn npm whoami`, Yarn first runs `npm login` in the background to check if there's an active NPM login session. If there is, it then executes the `whoami` command and returns the name associated with that login session. This information is typically used for authentication when publishing packages to the npm registry.

            [AI] `yarn npm whoami --publish` is a command used in Node.js projects to set the user name for publishing packages on the npm registry. Here's a breakdown of each part:

            - `yarn`: This is a package manager for Node.js, similar to npm but with improved performance and other features.
            - `npm`: This stands for "Node Package Manager", which is the default package manager for Node.js. It helps manage project dependencies and publish packages to the npm registry.
            - `whoami`: This command displays the currently logged in user name on the system. In this context, it's used to get the name of the user who will be publishing the package.
            - `--publish`: This option tells npm to use the given user name when publishing a package. If no user name is provided, `whoami` will return the current system user and npm will attempt to publish under that account, which might not have the necessary permissions. Instead, by using `--publish`, you explicitly provide the desired username.
        scope: '[AI] The `yarn` command `npm whoami --scope` is used to display the current npm authentication user and scope in a Yarn environment. When you run this command, it will print out the username associated with your npm account, followed by a forward slash (/) and an optional scope, which represents the organization or team managing the package registry for that account. If no scope is set, it will display just the username without the scope.'
