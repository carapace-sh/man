name: create MANIFEST_LIST MANIFEST [MANIFEST...]
description: Create a local manifest list for annotating and pushing to a registry
flags:
    --insecure: Allow communication with an insecure registry
    -a, --amend: Amend an existing manifest list
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker manifest create` command is used to generate a new Docker image manifest file from existing image manifests. It allows you to combine multiple layers or images into a single manifest with a specific tag and configuration settings such as the architecture and os. The resulting manifest file can then be used to build a new Docker image or push it to a registry for others to download and use.'
    flag:
        amend: '[AI] `docker manifest create --amend` is a command used in Docker to update an existing manifest file with new layers or configurations. It doesn''t create a new manifest from scratch, but instead appends or merges the new content into the existing one. The command takes one or more image tags as arguments and writes the updated manifest to a file specified by the `--file` option.'
        insecure: '[AI] The `docker manifest create --insecure` command is used to create a new Docker image manifest file, which defines the final form of an image including its configuration and layers. The `--insecure` flag allows the image to be pulled from an untrusted registry without requiring SSL certificate validation. In other words, it disables certificate verification during image pulls, which can pose a security risk if used with unverified or malicious registries.'
