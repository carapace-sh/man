documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git quiltimport` is a Git command used to import a Quilt patch series into a Git repository. Quilt is a patch management system, and this command allows you to apply a set of patches stored in the Quilt format to the current branch or commit in Git. By doing so, it creates new commits for each patch in the series, preserving the patch history.'
    flag:
        author: '[AI] `git quiltimport` is a Git extension for importing Quilt patch series into Git repositories. The `--author` option specifies that the author information in the Quilt patches should be overwritten with the given author name and email address during the import process. The format is `--author="Name <email@example.com>"`. This can be useful when importing patches from an external source where the Git repository''s current author information needs to be replaced.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `git quiltimport` is a Git extension command that allows you to apply a Quilt patch series to your Git repository. The `--dry-run` option is used with this command for a test run, meaning it will simulate the import process without actually applying the patches. This way, you can check if the import will have the desired effect without affecting your working directory or committing any changes.'
        keep-non-patch: '[AI] `git quiltimport` is a Git command used to import Quilt patch files into a Git repository. The `--keep-non-patch` option tells Git to keep the non-patch files (i.e., files that don''t have associated patches) in their original state when importing. This means that these files won''t be checked out or overwritten, allowing you to maintain their current state within your repository.'
        patches: '[AI] `git quiltimport --patches` is a Git command used to apply a series of patch files to the current Git repository. The `--patches` option specifies that each patch file should be provided as an argument, rather than being read from a file or standard input. Each patch file should represent a single commit and include the author, date, and message in the patch header. The command applies each patch to create a new commit with the same author information, preserving the patch history for future reference. This is a useful command when working with projects that use Quilt, a patch management system, as an alternative to Git''s native patching capabilities.'
        series: '[AI] `git quiltimport --series` is a Git command used to apply a Quilt series, which is a set of patch files managed by the Quilt tool for maintaining a stack of patches, into the current Git branch as a new commit series. This command reads the patch files from standard input or a file, and creates a new Git commit for each patch in the series with an informative commit message taken from the patch headers. The `--series` option tells Git to import all the patches in the Quilt series as individual commits instead of a single unified diff commit.'
