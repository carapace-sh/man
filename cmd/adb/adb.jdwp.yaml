documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `adb jdwp` command is used with Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to establish a JDWP (Java Debug Wire Protocol) connection for debugging Java applications on an Android device. This allows developers to inspect and modify the code, set breakpoints, and examine variables in real-time. The command syntax typically looks like: `adb shell am start -d <package> --ei com.android.doc.emulator.emu/debugmode true && adb jdwp <pid>` where `<package>` is the Android app package name, and `<pid>` is the process ID of the running Java application instance.'
