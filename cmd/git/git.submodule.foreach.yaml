        [AI] `git submodule foreach` is a Git command used to iterate over all the registered submodules in a Git repository and apply a given command to each one. The general syntax is:

        ```bash
        git submodule foreach <command>
        ```

        Replace `<command>` with the desired command to be executed inside the submodule working directory, like updating, checking out or executing a shell command. For instance, `git submodule foreach git pull origin master` will update all submodules in the current repository by pulling the latest changes from their respective remotes.
    flag:
        recursive: '[AI] `git submodule foreach` is a Git command used to iterate over all the submodules in your Git repository and apply a given command recursively to each one. The `--recursive` option tells Git to perform the operation not only on the current level''s submodules but also on the submodules of those submodules, and so on, allowing you to execute commands across all nested submodules within your repository.'
