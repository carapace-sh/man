description: Type as if you had typed it
flags:
    --clearmodifiers: Clear modifiers before sending keystrokes
    --delay=: Delay between keystrokes
    --window=: Send keystrokes to a specific window id
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `xdotool type` is a command from the xdotool toolset, used to simulate keyboard input into a specific window or application. The command sends the key event for typing a character or a sequence of keys, depending on the arguments passed to it. For example, `xdotool type "hello"` would send the keys "h e l l o" in quick succession. It''s a useful tool for automating keyboard interactions in graphical user interfaces.'
    flag:
        clearmodifiers: '[AI] `xdotool type --clearmodifiers` is a command from the xdotool toolkit in Linux, used to simulate keyboard input. The `type` action sends keystrokes as if they were typed on a physical keyboard. The `--clearmodifiers` option clears all modifier keys (like Shift, Control, or Alt) before sending the next key event. This allows for sending single character inputs without any modifiers, ensuring consistent output.'
        delay: |-
            [AI] `xdotool` is a versatile tool for automating and interacting with X11 applications from the command line. The `type` command is one of its features, allowing users to simulate various input events such as keyboard keys or mouse buttons.

            The `--delay` option sets the time in milliseconds between sending each event. For instance, `xdotool type --delay 500 key a` would send the "a" key every half second (500ms). This can be useful when automating tasks that require input with a delay between them to mimic human interaction more closely.
        window: |-
            [AI] `xdotool type --window` is a command-line tool used in Linux for automating user interface interactions. The `type` action specifies which input to send to a window, and `--window` option is used to specify the ID or title of the target window.

            In simple terms, `xdotool type --window <window_id_or_title>` sends the keyboard input corresponding to a specific key or sequence of keys to the active window with the given ID or title. This can be useful for scripting various automation tasks such as filling out forms, simulating keystrokes, and sending text input to applications.
