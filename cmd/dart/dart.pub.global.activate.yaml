    command: '[AI] `dart pub global activate` is a Dart command used to set up and activate a global package in the Dart environment. It installs the specified package into the global site packages directory and adds it to the `pubspec.yaml` file, allowing it to be easily accessed across multiple projects without having to specify the local path to the package during development. This simplifies the process of managing and using global packages in a Dart project.'
    flag:
        executable: '[AI] The `dart pub global activate` command is used to manage Dart global packages installed with `pub` - a package manager for Dart. The `--executable` option specifically tells the tool to make the given global package''s executable binary available on the system PATH, allowing it to be run from anywhere in the terminal or command prompt. This is particularly useful when dealing with standalone applications or tools built using Dart and published as global packages.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `dart pub global activate` command is used to configure Dart's global tool installation and usage. Specifically, the `--help` option displays detailed help information about this command. Here's a brief summary:

            This command activates or deactivates specific global tools (like `dart`, `flutter`, etc.) installed via the Dart package manager, `pub`. When invoked with `--help`, it provides the following information:

            - A short description of the command.
            - Information about required and optional arguments.
            - Usage examples.
            - Detailed explanations for each argument, including their default values and possible input validations.

            It is essential to have a good understanding of this command's functionality when managing global Dart tools installation and configuration.
        hosted-url: '[AI] The `dart pub global activate --hosted-url` command is used in Dart programming language to configure the global publisher for your project. With this command, you can set a specific URL as the hosted location for packages, overriding the default Pub serving at `pub.dev`. This can be useful when working with private package repositories or other specific use cases where you want to ensure consistent access to certain packages.'
        no-executables: |-
            [AI] The `dart pub global activate --no-executables` command is used in Dart programming to configure the global Dart tool installations managed by the `pub` package manager.

            The `activate` sub-command enables or disables the usage of a specific global tool installation. By using `--no-executables`, we instruct the command to not enable any executable (CLI) tools, but only Dart SDKs and other library packages. This means that when you run this command for a particular Dart version, it will be set up as a Dart SDK installation, which can be selected using `dart:<version>` in your `pubspec.yaml` file or by setting the `DART_SDK_PATH` environment variable.
        overwrite: '[AI] `dart pub global activate --overwrite` is a command used in Dart programming language for managing and configuring project-wide dependencies via the Dart package manager, called `pub`. The `global activate` subcommand installs and sets up the specified packages globally, meaning they can be accessed from any project without having to add them as dependencies individually. The `--overwrite` option allows replacing existing global packages with new ones of the same name.'
        source: '[AI] The `dart pub global activate --source` command is used in Dart programming to configure the global Dart Pub package manager to use a specific package repository as its default source. This command takes effect system-wide, meaning it applies to all Dart projects on the current machine. By default, Dart Pub uses the Dart package registry (pub.dartlang.org) as its source. To change this, you would provide the URL of your preferred package repository as an argument to the command. For example: `dart pub global activate <custom_registry_url>`. Once executed, any new packages installed using `pub get` or `pub install` will be retrieved from the specified registry.'
