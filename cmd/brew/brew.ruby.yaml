documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `brew` command with the argument `ruby` is used to install or manage Ruby versions through Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. It retrieves and compiles the specified Ruby version from its sources if it''s not already installed. Once the installation is complete, Homebrew sets up the environment variables required to use the new Ruby version in your terminal.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `brew install ruby` is a command used to install Ruby using Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--debug` flag that follows is an optional argument that enables detailed output and debugging information during the installation process. This can be useful for troubleshooting potential issues or gaining insight into how Ruby is being installed. However, it results in a longer installation time and more extensive log output. In summary, `brew install ruby --debug` provides enhanced diagnostic data while installing Ruby using Homebrew.'
        e: '[AI] `brew ruby -e` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command installs and sets up a new version of Ruby using Homebrew, then executes a block of Ruby code passed as an argument (-e) immediately after the installation. The code block is usually enclosed within backquotes (`) or within a here-document (delimited by <<'' or <<" with appropriate indentation). This command is useful when you need to install and run a one-off script written in Ruby without having to create a separate file for the script.'
        help: '[AI] `brew ruby --help` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux. The command requests help for installing or managing Ruby, a programming language, using Homebrew. It provides information on available options, how to install Ruby versions, and updates or uninstalls existing ones.'
        quiet: '[AI] `brew install ruby` is a command used with Homebrew, a package manager for macOS, to install the Ruby programming language. The `--quiet` option is used with it to suppress the output of informational messages during the installation process. So, `brew install ruby --quiet` will quietly install Ruby without displaying progress reports or other non-error messages.'
        r: '[AI] The command `brew install ruby` is used to install Ruby using Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The option `-r` that follows `install` is not a valid flag for this command. However, if you meant to load an additional Ruby extension or gem after the installation, use `brew install ruby --with-gems=<gem_name>` or `bundle install` instead. To use the installed Ruby version with your terminal session, run `brew link ruby` and add `/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin` to your PATH environment variable.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew ruby --verbose` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command installs Ruby (a programming language) using Homebrew with increased output detail. The `--verbose` flag instructs Homebrew to provide more information about the installation process, including intermediate steps and any potential issues or warnings that may arise during the installation. This can be helpful for users who want a better understanding of what''s happening behind the scenes during the installation process.'
