description: Operate on namespaces
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `circleci namespace` command is not a standard CircleCI command. It seems like there might be some confusion with the term "namespace" in this context, as it has different meanings in CircleCI and Kubernetes (where the term is commonly used). In CircleCI context, namespaces are projects or collections of projects under an organization. To work with your CircleCI projects, you usually don''t need to use specific commands related to namespaces. Instead, use the CircleCI API or web interface to manage your organizations and projects.'
