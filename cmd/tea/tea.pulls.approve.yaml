documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "tea pulls approve" is not a standard command in version control systems like Git or SVN. It seems to be specific to the Teaspoon testing framework for Ruby. This command is used to pull changes that have been approved in the Teaspoon''s RSpec-like testing framework workflow. In simple terms, it fetches and merges changes that have passed approval in Teaspoon''s continuous integration or testing environment.'
    flag:
        login: |-
            [AI] The command `tea pull approve --login` is used in the TEA (Temporal Efficient Ansible) framework for managing Kubernetes clusters. This command performs the following actions:

            1. Pulls the latest changes from the upstream repository (usually a GitHub repository) into your local working directory.
            2. Approves the changes for merging into the default branch in TEA's GitHub repository, assuming you have the necessary permissions.
            3. Logs into your Kubernetes cluster using the `kubeconfig` file managed by TEA, so you can apply the approved changes if needed.
        output: |-
            [AI] The `tea pulls approve --output` command is used in the TEA (Travis CI Encrypted Artifacts) tool for handling encrypted artifacts in GitHub actions workflows.

            This specific command does the following:

            1. Fetches encrypted artifacts from a GitHub repository.
            2. Approves the encryption keys associated with those artifacts for decryption and use.
            3. Outputs the decrypted artifact contents as text or base64-encoded bytes to stdout, which can be captured and used in subsequent steps within the workflow.
        remote: '[AI] The `--remote` flag in the `git pull` or `git fetch` command with `teapot` as the first argument is used to initiate a push or fetch operation from a remote repository over SSH without requiring user interaction for authentication. The term "teapot" is not an official Git term but rather refers to an alias or script that wraps around the `ssh-askpass` command, which is responsible for asking for the passphrase when using SSH keys. By adding `--remote` flag, we allow Git to use the key without asking for confirmation, making it a seamless operation in automated workflows or continuous integration environments.'
        repo: '[AI] `tea pull request approve --repo` is a command for the Tectonic (TEA) CLI, which is a tool used to manage GitOps workflows with Red Hat OpenShift. This command is used to approve a pull request in a specific repository managed by TEA. When run, it signals that the reviewer has checked and approved the changes made in the pull request, enabling the update of the git repository and the deployment of the new changes to the OpenShift cluster.'
