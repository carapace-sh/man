documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea organizations delete` command in the TEA (Teapot Database Management System) is used to delete an existing organization from the Teapot database. When executed, it removes all data associated with that specific organization, including its name, members, projects, and any other related information. This command helps in managing organizational data within the Teapot system.'
    flag:
        login: '[AI] The `--login` option is used with some Git or version control commands to perform the action with provided user credentials (username and password). The command `tea organizations delete --login` appears to be a custom or misconfigured command, as there seems to be no known standard Git or version control command named "tea organizations delete" that includes the `--login` option. It is likely a mistake and should be double-checked for correctness before execution.'
        remote: '[AI] The `git` command `tea organizations delete --remote` is used to permanently delete a Git organization and all its associated repositories from a remote Git server, such as GitHub or GitLab. The `--remote` flag indicates that this action will be performed on the remote repository, rather than just on the local one. This operation should be done with caution, as it cannot be undone. Once an organization and its repositories are deleted, all data associated with them will be permanently lost.'
