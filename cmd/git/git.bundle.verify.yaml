description: check that a bundle file is valid
flags:
    -q, --quiet: do not show bundle details
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git bundle verify` is a Git command used to validate the integrity of a bundle file, which is a compressed and signed archive containing Git commits, branches, or tags. The bundle file is created using `git bundle create`, and it can be exchanged between users who don''t have network access to each other. By running `git bundle verify <bundle>`, you ensure that the bundle file hasn''t been tampered with during transfer, as it checks the signature and the committed data for accuracy.'
    flag:
        quiet: '[AI] `git bundle verify --quiet` is a Git command used to validate the integrity of a bundle file, which is essentially a compressed archive of a Git repository''s history and configuration. This command performs a SHA-1 checksum comparison between the bundled data and its corresponding master branch in the source repository. If the validation passes without any discrepancies, it returns a quiet success message (i.e., no output). In contrast, without the `--quiet` option, it will print detailed progress information during the verification process.'
