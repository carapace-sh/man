        conflict-status: '[AI] `gh pr status --conflict-status` is a GitHub CLI command used to check the conflict status of a specific pull request.

        jq: |-
            [AI] `gh pr status --jq` is a command used with GitHub's `gh` CLI tool to retrieve information about pull requests (PRs) and filter the output using `jq`, a lightweight and flexible JSON processor.

            In this specific command, we are requesting the current status of one or more PRs, and piping that output through `jq` for further processing. The exact result will depend on the `jq` query used to filter and format the data, but it could include details such as PR number, title, status (e.g., open, merged), and any associated labels or comments.
        json: '[AI] `gh pr status --json` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to retrieve the current state of one or more pull requests in a JSON format. This command allows users to programmatically access and manipulate pull request data, such as the current state (open, closed, merged, etc.), number, title, and other relevant information.'
        template: '[AI] `gh pr status --template` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to display the current status of a pull request (PR), using a custom template for output formatting. The `--template` option allows specifying a Go Text/Template-formatted string, which defines how the output should be displayed. This command helps developers quickly get essential information about their PRs in a desired format.'
