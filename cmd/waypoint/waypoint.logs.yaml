This command retrieves the logs of a specific Kubernetes resource, such as a container or a pod, and displays them in plain text format without any extra formatting or colorization. The `--plain` flag is optional when using the `kubectl logs` command but is specifically used with Waypoint for this purpose.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint logs --project` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source Kubernetes application delivery platform. This command displays the logs of all resources in the specified Kubernetes project. By providing a project name with the `--project` flag, Waypoint filters the logs to only show those related to resources within that project. This can be helpful for debugging and monitoring applications deployed in Kubernetes using Waypoint.'
