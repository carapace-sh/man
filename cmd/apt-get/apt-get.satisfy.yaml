description: satisfy causes apt-get to satisfy the given dependency strings
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `apt-get satisfy` is a command used with APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) in Debian-based Linux distributions to check if the current system meets the dependencies specified in a given package file or source. It does not install or upgrade any packages, but rather reports whether the current state of the system would allow for the installation of the specified package without dependency conflicts. This command can be useful for resolving dependency issues before actually attempting an installation.'
