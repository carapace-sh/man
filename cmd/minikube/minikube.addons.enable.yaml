documentation:
    command: '[AI] `minikube addons enable` is a command used with Minikube, a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. This command enables specified Addons in your Minikube cluster. Addons are extensions that provide extra functionality, such as ingress controllers or storage classes. The command takes one or more addon names as arguments and configures them to be enabled when starting or resetting the Minikube cluster.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `minikube addons enable --force` is a command used in Minikube, a tool for running Kubernetes locally. This command enables a specific addon in Minikube, which are optional extensions that provide additional functionality. The `--force` flag is used to override any existing configuration or state that may prevent the addon from being enabled. It''s important to note that using `--force` should be done with caution as it can potentially disrupt running workloads or configurations.'
        images: '[AI] The `minikube addons enable --images` command is used in Minikube, a tool for running Kubernetes locally, to enable the Images addon. This addon allows Minikube to pull base images and custom Docker images from external registries for use in your Kubernetes cluster. By default, this feature is disabled for security reasons as it opens up access to external repositories. Enabling it can make it easier to deploy applications that rely on specific base or container images not available locally.'
        refresh: |-
            [AI] `minikube addons enable --refresh` is a command used with Minikube, a tool for running Kubernetes locally. This command enables and refreshes enabled Addons in the Minikube cluster.

            Addons are extensions that provide additional functionality to the Minikube environment. Enabling an add-on installs and configures it in the cluster. The `--refresh` flag updates the configuration of already enabled addons, applying any new configurations or changes. By using both flags together, you ensure your Minikube cluster has the latest addon features and configurations applied.
        registries: '[AI] The `minikube addons enable --registries` command is used in Minikube, a tool for running Kubernetes locally, to enable the Registry Addon. This addon integrates Minikube with container registries like Docker Hub, Google Container Registry (GCR), or Quay.io. Enabling this addon allows Minikube to pull and deploy containers from these registries in your Kubernetes clusters.'
