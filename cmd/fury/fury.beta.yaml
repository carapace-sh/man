    command: '[AI] The command "fury beta" likely refers to accessing or using the beta version of Fury, which is a software or application. The specifics depend on the context; for instance, it might be used in the context of video games, where a beta is an early version of the game that is open to testing by the public before its official release. To use the command, one would typically follow instructions provided by the software or platform developer, such as joining a beta testing program or downloading a beta build from a designated website. The exact process can vary and should be determined based on the specific application of Fury and its development team''s guidelines.'
