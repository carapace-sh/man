documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `rustup toolchain install` command is used to install a specific Rust toolchain version managed by Rustup. Rustup is a Rust installation and configuration utility, and it allows managing multiple Rust toolchains. This command installs the requested toolchain and sets it as the default for your current project or system-wide depending on how you invoke it. For instance, `rustup toolchain install nightly` will install the Nightly toolchain.'
    flag:
        allow-downgrade: '[AI] `rustup toolchain install --allow-downgrade` is a Rust package manager command used to install a specific Rust toolchain version. The `--allow-downgrade` option permits the installation of a newer toolchain that may have older version compatibility, which could be useful in certain situations where specific projects require an older Rust compiler or runtime. This command updates the current default toolchain or creates a new toolchain if none exists with the given name, and sets it as the default for your project.'
        component: '[AI] `rustup toolchain install --component` is a Rust command used to install specific components, such as Rust versions or packages, within a specified Rust toolchain. This command allows users to manage their Rust development environment by selecting and installing the desired components for their projects.'
        force: '[AI] `rustup toolchain install --force` is a Rust package manager command used to install or update a specific Rust toolchain (a version of Rust compiler and standard library) in your system. The `--force` flag is an optional argument that overwrites any existing installation with the same name, regardless if it''s currently in use or not. This can be useful when dealing with conflicting toolchains or when you need to ensure a specific version is installed without any interference from others.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `rustup toolchain install --help` is a command used in Rust programming language's Rustup utility to install a specific Rust toolchain. The `--help` flag provides detailed information about how to use this command effectively. Here's a brief overview of the available options:

            1. `--toolchain <NAME>`: Specify the name or the path to the toolchain to be installed.
            2. `--install <path>`: Choose the directory where Rustup should install the toolchain. By default, it will install in the system path.
            3. `--precise`: Install a specific minor revision of a given major and patch version. For instance, `rustup toolchain install 1.47.0 --precise`.
            4. `--no-modify-paths`: Do not modify the $RUSTUP_TARGET or $RUSTUP_HOME environment variables when switching between toolchains.
            5. `--query-mode`: Query Rustup for available toolchains and their installation details without actually installing anything.

            For more in-depth information, you can refer to the official Rustup documentation by running `rustup help install`.
        no-self-update: '[AI] `rustup` is a Rust language installation and management tool. The command `rustup toolchain install <toolchain> --no-self-update` instructs `rustup` to install the specified `<toolchain>` without updating `rustup` itself during the process. This can be useful when you want to install a specific version of Rust or a particular toolchain without affecting the current `rustup` state.'
        profile: '[AI] `rustup` is a Rust installation and configuration tool. The command `rustup toolchain install --profile <name>` is used to install a new Rust toolchain with a specific name in the `--profile` argument. This command installs the toolchain along with any dependencies, making it available for use when setting the active toolchain using `rustup default <name>`. By having multiple toolchains installed, you can choose which one to use for your projects with different requirements.'
        target: '[AI] `rustup` is a Rust toolchain installer and manager. The command `rustup toolchain install --target TARGET` installs or changes the active Rust toolchain for the specified target triangle triple (e.g., `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`). This command installs the Rust compiler and its associated components (standard library, documentation, etc.) for the target, allowing you to compile Rust code for that specific platform or environment.'
