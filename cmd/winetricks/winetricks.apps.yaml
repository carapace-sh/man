    command: '[AI] WineTricks is a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing Wine, a compatibility layer that allows Windows applications to run on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. The "winetricks apps" command is not valid as such in WineTricks or Wine itself. Instead, you can use the WineTricks graphical interface to install winetricks packages (dlls or other software components) necessary for specific Windows applications to run under Wine.'
