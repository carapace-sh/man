description: Remove instances from the state
flags:
    -backup?: Path where Terraform should write the backup state.
    -dry-run: Only print out what would've been removed
    -ignore-remote-version: Continue even if remote and local Terraform versions are incompatible.
    -lock: Don't hold a state lock during the operation.
    -lock-timeout?: Duration to retry a state lock.
    -state?: Path to the state file to update.

    command: '[AI] The command `tofu state rm` is used in Tofu, a Git-based data modeling tool, to remove a specified resource or file from the Tofu staging area and working directory. It permanently deletes the local file but does not affect the remote repository until you commit the change.'
    flag:
        backup: |-
            [AI] The command `tofu state rm --backup` is not a standard flag or command in Linux or any common software. It appears to be a custom command specific to the Tofu file system, which is a data loss resilient and versioning file system.

            The command `rm` is a common UNIX command for removing files or directories, while the `--backup` option creates a backup of the removed file using the `.bak` extension before deletion. In this context, the `tofu state rm --backup` command would remove a file or directory in the Tofu file system and create a backup of it before doing so.
        dry-run: |-
            [AI] The command "tofu state rm --dry-run" is not a standard Linux or Unix command, as it seems to be a custom command specific to Tofu, a Kubernetes open-source tool for managing and securing Kubernetes clusters.

            The "--dry-run" option in this context is a common flag used in many Unix/Linux tools, including Kubernetes commands, which simulates the execution of an operation without actually applying the changes. In other words, it shows what would be done if you ran the command for real but doesn't make any permanent modifications to your resources or data.

            So, the "tofu state rm --dry-run" command, in essence, is a preview or test run of deleting one or more Kubernetes resources (states) managed by Tofu, without actually deleting them. This helps you understand the impact of your actions before executing the removal in a production environment.
        ignore-remote-version: |-
            [AI] The `tofu` flag is used with the `git rm` command in Git version control system. It stands for "Test Objects For Updates" and is followed by the `--` and then `ignore-remote-version` arguments.

            When you use `git rm --tofu`, Git checks if the local and remote files match in size and checksum before removing the file from your local repository. If they match, the file will be removed both locally and remotely. However, if they don't match, Git will keep the local file and give a warning that there is a conflict regarding the removal of this file between the local and remote repositories.

            The `--ignore-remote-version` option instructs Git to remove the local file without checking its version on the remote repository, even if they don't match. This could potentially result in data loss if the remote has a newer or different version of the file that you want to keep. So use this option with caution.
        lock: |-
            [AI] The command `tofu state rm -lock` is not a standard Linux or Unix command, but rather specific to the TofuFS filesystem, which is a distributed and decentralized file system designed for secure data sharing.

            This command removes a lock on a file or directory within the TofuFS system. The `rm` part of the command indicates that the lock is being removed, while the `-lock` option specifies that only locks should be removed and not any associated files or directories.
        lock-timeout: |-
            [AI] The command `rm -r --no-preserve-root --recursive` is a common Unix command used to remove files and directories recursively, forcing removal of empty directories as well.

            The option `--no-preserve-root` disables the restriction that prevents removing files outside the current directory. The `--recursive` flag enables the removal of all files and subdirectories under a given directory.

            The `tofu state rm -lock-timeout` part is not related to the core `rm` command but rather an extension or modification to it, likely provided by a specific file system or version control system like Git. The `lock-timeout` option sets a timeout for acquiring a lock on files that are being removed to prevent conflicting writes. If a lock can't be acquired within the specified time, the removal operation will fail. This is useful in collaborative environments where multiple users might be working on the same files.
        state: |-
            [AI] The command `tofu state rm --state=<STATE>` is not a standard Linux command, as there's no tool called "tofu" with that exact syntax in common file system utilities like FindFs or FSStats. However, I will explain the general meaning of the given Rm (remove) command with the `--state` option based on similar concepts found in other tools, such as `find` or `rsync`.

            The `rm` command is a standard Linux utility for removing files and directories. When used with the `--state` option, it is likely intended to remove only files or directories that match a specific state (e.g., modified, unmodified, or any other file state). The state can be specified as an argument to the option, such as `--state=MODIFIED`.

            In summary, this command would delete files or directories based on their file state, and the specific state is defined by the provided argument (e.g., "MODIFIED" or "UNMODIFIED"). However, since there's no tool called "tofu" with that exact syntax, this explanation should be considered a general interpretation of the command's intended functionality.
