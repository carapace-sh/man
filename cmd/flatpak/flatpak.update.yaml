    command: '[AI] `flatpak update` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to check for and install available updates for currently installed Flatpak applications or the Flatpak runtime itself. It scans the repositories defined in your Flatpak configuration files, downloads any available updates, and applies them upon successful installation. The command does not require any additional arguments by default but can accept specific application IDs to update only those applications. It helps keep your system up-to-date with the latest security patches and bug fixes for your installed Flatpak software.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `flatpak update --app` command is used to update specific Flatpak applications installed on a system. Flatpak is a software deployment and application packaging system for Linux. With this command, you can check for available updates for one or more applications and install them if found. It''s important to note that the system itself and other packages may also need updating before applying application updates. You can provide the application names as arguments to update multiple apps at once.'
        appstream: '[AI] `flatpak update --appstream` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system for updating installed applications along with their metadata, specifically the AppStream data. AppStream metadata provides application information for various desktop environments and interfaces such as GNOME Software Center or KDE Discover to display user-friendly descriptions, icons, and other details. By running `flatpak update --appstream`, you ensure that the most current information about your applications is available, making it easier to manage your installed software.'
        arch: '[AI] The `flatpak update --arch` command is used to update Flatpak applications and their runtimes on a system, specifically for the given architecture. Flatpak is a software deployment and application packaging system for Linux distributions. This command checks for available updates for all installed Flatpak applications and runtimes with the specified architecture and applies them if found. It''s important to note that this command should be executed as root or with sudo privileges.'
        assumeyes: '[AI] `flatpak update --assumeyes` is a command used in the Flatpak software deployment platform. This command initiates an automatic update of installed Flatpaks without prompting for confirmation before applying the changes. The `--assumeyes` flag means "answer yes to all prompts" or "assume yes," allowing the update process to proceed uninterrupted. Be cautious when using this option, as it may install new versions of applications that could introduce compatibility issues or other unintended consequences without user approval.'
        commit: '[AI] `flatpak update --commit` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. This command prompts the user to create a new commit point for the current set of installed applications. In simpler terms, it takes a snapshot of the current state of all installed Flatpaks and saves it as a new commit in the Flatpak repository. This can be useful for creating a backup or rollback point before updating applications individually or en masse.'
        force-remove: '[AI] `flatpak update --force-Remove` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system. It instructs Flatpak to update all installed applications with the latest available versions. The `--force-remove` option enables forceful removal of applications that have dependencies on packages being removed during the update process. This can help resolve dependency conflicts and ensure a clean installation. Note that using this option may lead to unintended consequences, such as removing necessary packages for some applications. Therefore, it should be used with caution.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `flatpak update` is a command-line tool provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The `--help` option, when used with this command, displays detailed help information about how to use the `update` sub-command effectively.

            Here's what you can expect from the output:

            1. Usage: The usage instructions are shown, such as the correct syntax for using the `update` command, e.g., `flatpak update [OPTIONS] [APPLICATION_ID...]`.
            2. Options: A list of available options and their descriptions is provided. This includes options like:
               - `--all` or `-a`: Update all installed applications.
               - `--user`: Only update user applications (as opposed to system applications).
               - `--system`: Only update system applications.
               - `--repocache`: Update the local repository cache.
               - `--no-confirm` or `-n`: Don't ask for confirmation before performing updates.
            3. Examples: A few usage examples are provided, demonstrating common ways to use the `update` command in different scenarios.
        installation: '[AI] The `flatpak update --installation` command is used to check for and install available updates for all installed Flatpak applications on your system. Flatpak is a software distribution platform that allows developers to build and distribute desktop applications in universal, sandboxed runtime environments. This command helps ensure your Flatpak applications are up-to-date with the latest security patches and new features. It searches for updates both from your local repositories and remote channels (if configured), and installs them automatically when found.'
        no-deploy: '[AI] `flatpak update --no-deploy` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system. It initiates an update of installed Flatpak applications to their latest available versions, but unlike the default `update` command, it does not automatically deploy or activate the newly updated applications. Instead, the updated packages remain on the system ready for deployment at a later time with the `deploy-new` command. This can be useful when wanting to test new updates before making them active in production environments.'
        no-deps: '[AI] The `flatpak update --no-deps` command is used to update installed Flatpak applications without updating their dependencies. Flatpak is a application packaging and deployment system that allows software to be easily installed, updated, and managed across different Linux distributions. By using the `--no-deps` option, only the installed applications themselves will be updated to their latest versions, while their dependencies will remain unchanged. This can be useful when you want to update an application without affecting its dependencies, which could potentially introduce compatibility issues or require additional configuration adjustments.'
        no-pull: '[AI] The `flatpak update --no-pull` command is used to update installed Flatpak applications without pulling new repositories or refreshing the current repository data. It''s an efficient way to perform updates when you already have the required repositories and just want to apply the latest available application versions without incurring additional network traffic. The `--no-pull` option instructs Flatpak not to pull or refresh any repository information, making it quicker for systems with a large number of repositories or slow internet connections.'
        no-related: '[AI] The `flatpak update --no-related` command is used to update a specific Flatpak application installation without affecting other related applications. Flatpak is a software deployment and application packaging system for Linux and other Unix systems. By using the `--no-related` option, the command only updates the specified application, leaving other installed applications unaffected. This can be useful to apply updates selectively or in isolation for testing purposes.'
        no-static-deltas: '[AI] `flatpak update` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system to install or update installed applications. The `--no-static-deltas` option disables the use of static deltas during the update process. Static deltas are small files that record changes between versions, allowing for efficient incremental updates. However, they require additional processing time and disk space. By disabling this option, the entire new package is downloaded and installed instead. This can result in larger downloads but may improve reliability and simplify the update process.'
        noninteractive: '[AI] `flatpak update --noninteractive` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to check for and install available updates for installed applications without user interaction. The `--noninteractive` flag ensures that the process runs automatically, without any prompts or confirmation dialogs appearing on the screen. This can be useful in automated scripts or continuous integration environments where no human intervention is required during the update process.'
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak update --ostree-verbose` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system for updating installed applications. The `--ostree-verbose` option increases the output of the command, providing more detailed information about the ongoing update process. It uses OSTree as the underlying storage back-end and updates each application''s bundle in an atomic manner. This means that if anything goes wrong during the update, it can be easily rolled back to its previous state. The verbose output helps diagnose any potential issues during the update process.'
        runtime: '[AI] `flatpak update --runtime` is a command used in the Flatpak packaging system to upgrade the installed runtime (a collection of libraries and runtimes for a specific platform version) to its latest available version. This ensures that all applications using that runtime are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and improvements.'
        sideload-repo: '[AI] `flatpak update --sideload-repo` is a command used in the Flatpak packaging system to update and refresh the repositories that are used for sideloading applications. Sideloading allows installing and updating applications from local or custom repositories instead of the official ones. Running this command will fetch the latest metadata and certificates, enabling you to install or update applications using those repositories.'
        subpath: '[AI] The `flatpak update --subpath` command is used to update a specific Flatpak application and its data files located in a custom sub-path. By default, Flatpak installations are isolated, meaning that each installation has its own data files. However, the `--subpath` option allows specifying a custom path for the installation''s data files, making it possible to share data between multiple instances of the same application. This command updates both the runtime and the application itself, along with their associated sub-paths if present.'
        system: '[AI] `flatpak update --system` is a command used in the Flatpak application packaging system. It instructs the Flatpak client to check for and install updates for all system-wide installed Flatpak applications. These are applications that have been installed using the root privileges, affecting all users on the system. By running `--system` instead of a regular user update command, you ensure that all installed applications are updated across the entire system, ensuring consistency and security.'
        user: '[AI] `flatpak update --user` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to update all installed applications that are meant for an individual user''s account. This operation does not require root privileges and changes only affect the current user''s applications. In contrast, using `flatpak update` without `--user` will update applications system-wide.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak update --verbose` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager to update installed applications and their runtimes. The `--verbose` option increases the output level of information provided during the updating process, allowing users to see detailed progress reports including the names of packages being updated, their current and new versions, and any messages or warnings that may occur throughout the process.'
