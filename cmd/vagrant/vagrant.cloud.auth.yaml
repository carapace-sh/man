description: For various authorization operations on Vagrant Cloud
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud auth` command is used to authenticate with Vagrantcloud, the public registry for Boxes and Images used by Vagrant. This authentication is necessary before you can download or share Vagrant content from the registry. When you run this command in your terminal, it opens a browser window where you log in with your Vagrantcloud account credentials. Upon successful login, a token is generated and saved to your `~/.vagrant.d/config/Vagrantfile` or `~/.vagrant.d/Machines/default/config.rb`, allowing Vagrant to access the registry with your account privileges.'
