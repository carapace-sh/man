    command: '[AI] The `tea pull request reopen` command is used in the TeaDB database management system to reopen a previously closed pull request. Pull requests in TeaDB represent proposed changes to a database schema or configuration, and closing a pull request signifies that the changes have been reviewed and approved for merging into the main repository. By using `tea pull request reopen`, you can make further modifications to the changes before they are merged, allowing for collaboration and iterative development.'

            [AI] The command "tea pulls reopen --login" is related to the Git version control system and the TEA (Trailing Edge Almighty) tool, which is an extension for Git that simplifies common workflows.

            This specific command does the following:

            1. `tea pulls`: This part of the command fetches new changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local repository. It automatically resolves any conflicts and updates your working directory to reflect the latest state of the remote branch.
            2. `reopen`: This argument instructs TEA to reopen the most recent merge conflict that was not yet resolved. It allows you to interactively edit the conflicting files and manually decide how to resolve the differences between the local and remote changes.
            3. `--login`: This argument tells TEA to authenticate with a Git remote using SSH keys or other authentication methods supported by your Git setup before performing the pull request. It's helpful when working with remote repositories that require secure access (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
        output: |-
            [AI] The command `tea pulls reopen --output` is related to the TEA (Temporal Event Anomaly) detection system, which is a tool used for identifying anomalous data patterns in time-series datasets.

            The specific flags used in this command have the following meanings:

            * `pulls`: This flag indicates that you want to retrieve new changes or updates from a remote repository or branch. In the context of TEA, this might refer to pulling the latest anomaly detection models or rules.
            * `reopen`: This flag could potentially mean reopening an existing pull request or issue related to anomaly detections. However, without more context, it's hard to be definitive about its meaning in this command.
            * `--output`: This flag specifies that the command should produce output, usually in a specific format such as JSON or CSV, which can be further processed by other tools or scripts. In the context of TEA, the output might include information on detected anomalies or their characteristics.
        remote: |-
            [AI] The command `tea pulls reopen --remote` is used with the TeaVM version control system. It consists of three parts:

            1. `tea pulls`: This is a command that fetches new changes from a remote repository and merges them into the local one. It ensures that your working directory is up-to-date with the latest code in the central repository.
            2. `reopen`: This is an optional argument that allows you to reopen a previously abandoned branch or merge commit. Once a branch is abandoned, it is no longer tracked by TeaVM. By using this command, you can resume work on that branch and continue making changes.
            3. `--remote`: This flag specifies that you want to fetch and pull changes from the remote repository instead of a local one. It ensures that you get the most current version of the code when working with collaborators or remote projects.
        repo: '[AI] The command `git pull --rebase origin tea-branch` is used in Git version control system to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository named ''origin'' into your local branch named ''tea''. The `--rebase` option means that the changes will be applied on top of your current branch instead of creating a new merge commit. This command helps to keep your local and remote branches synchronized, resolving any potential conflicts during the merging process.'
