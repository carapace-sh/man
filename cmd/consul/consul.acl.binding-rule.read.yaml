documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule read` command is used in Hashicorp Consul to retrieve the details of existing binding rules in the Access Control List (ACL) configuration. Binding rules define how ACL policies are applied to services and keys in Consul, allowing fine-grained access control. By executing this command, you can view the identifier, source, destination, and other attributes for each binding rule in your Consul setup.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule read --ca-file` command is used to retrieve binding rules from Consul Access Control List (ACL) with a specific CA file for certificate authentication. Consul ACL is a feature that allows managing access to resources in the Consul service discovery and configuration management platform using access control policies. Binding rules define how services or nodes can connect to each other based on certain conditions, such as source addresses, capabilities, or tags. The `--ca-file` option specifies the path to a CA file containing the certificate authorities trusted by the client making this API call. This command returns the details of the binding rules that match the given conditions and are signed by the specified CA.'
        ca-path: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule read --ca-path` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command reads ACL (Access Control List) binding rules from the Consul server with a specific CA (Certificate Authority) path.

            Consul's Access Control Lists provide fine-grained access control to its HTTP API, gRPC API, and other services. Binding rules define how ACL policies attach to different resources within Consul.

            The `--ca-path` option specifies the location of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file used for verifying secure communication with the Consul server while retrieving the ACL binding rules. This helps ensure data security and integrity during the communication between your client and the server.
        client-cert: '[AI] `consul acl binding-rule read --client-cert` is a command used with the Consul Access Control List (ACL) tool. It reads and displays ACL binding rules that are associated with a specific client certificate. The `--client-cert` option specifies the path to the client certificate file, which is used for authentication and authorization purposes in Consul. The output of this command provides details about the permissions and access granted to the specified client through its associated binding rules.'
        client-key: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule read --client-key` command is used in the Consul access control list (ACL) system to retrieve the details of a specific binding rule based on its associated client key.

            Consul ACL allows administrators to define and manage access policies for different resources in their service discovery, configuration, and orchestration platform. Binding rules are an essential part of this system as they control which clients can connect to which services.

            The `read` sub-command here is used to retrieve information about a resource - in this case, a binding rule. The `--client-key` option specifies the unique key associated with the client that owns the binding rule. By providing this key, Consul returns the details of the corresponding binding rule, including its ID, the services it binds to, and any additional metadata.
        datacenter: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule read --datacenter` command is used with Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration management, and orchestration. This specific command is used to retrieve the Access Control List (ACL) binding rules related to a particular datacenter in Consul''s ACL policy. The output provides details about which policies allow access to which resources within that datacenter. It helps administrators manage and monitor access control settings for their Consul services and infrastructure.'
        format: '[AI] `consul acl binding-rule read --format` is a command used with Hashicorp''s Consul Access Control List (ACL) tool. This command reads the ACL rules related to binding and returns the output in a specified format, usually JSON or Table. The `--format` option specifies how the output should be formatted for easier processing by scripts or other tools.'
        http-addr: |-
            [AI] The command `consul acl binding-rule read --http-addr` is used with the Consul ACL (Access Control List) tool to retrieve the details of binding rules for a specific HTTP address.

            Consul is an open-source distributed, highly available, and data center-aware solution to connect and configure applications at any scale. The Consul ACL feature provides a way to define and manage access control policies for various resources within a Consul cluster.

            This command targets the binding rules specifically, which are used to grant or deny access to HTTP requests based on their source address (IP or domain name). By specifying the `--http-addr` argument, you're asking Consul to return only the binding rules that apply to the given HTTP address.
        id: '[AI] The command `consul acl binding-rule read --id <ID>` is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command reads the details of a specific Access Control List (ACL) binding rule with the given ID from Consul''s ACL policy. The output includes information such as the rule''s creation time, principal IDs it applies to, permissions granted, and any conditions that must be met for the rule to take effect.'
        meta: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule read --meta` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. It retrieves metadata related to ACL (Access Control List) binding rules that have been defined in Consul. The metadata includes information such as the rule ID, creator ID, creation time, and any custom tags associated with the rule. This command helps administrators manage and understand the security policies applied within their Consul environment.'
        namespace: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule read --namespace` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command specifically relates to Access Control Lists (ACL) in Consul.

            The `read` action means that the command is intended to retrieve information from Consul's ACL system. The `--namespace` flag indicates that the command will operate on a specific namespace within the Consul hierarchy, rather than the default one. This can be useful in larger deployments where multiple namespaces are used to separate different teams or projects.

            In summary, the `consul acl binding-rule read --namespace` command retrieves the ACL binding rules for a specified namespace in Consul.
        stale: '[AI] `consul acl binding-rule read --stale` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source service discovery and configuration management tool. This command reads the Access Control List (ACL) binding rules from the Consul server with the `--stale` flag enabling the return of stale (potentially outdated) data. The binding rules define how ACL policies are applied to Consul resources such as keys, services, and nodes. By using this command with the `--stale` flag, you can retrieve the current binding rule configuration even if there are temporary disruptions in communication with the Consul server.'
        tls-server-name: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule read --tls-server-name` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery and configuration management. This command is specifically for reading Access Control List (ACL) binding rules with TLS server name verification enabled.

            When using TLS to secure communications between clients and servers, the server's identity is verified based on its presented certificate and the expected server name. The `--tls-server-name` flag ensures that only requests coming from clients that trust the specified server name are allowed to access the resource protected by Consul's ACL policies. This adds an extra layer of security, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks or misconfigured certificates.
        token: '[AI] The command `consul acl binding-rule read --token` is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command retrieves the details of ACL (Access Control List) binding rules with the given token from Consul''s Access Control List policy. By using this command, you can view and manage the rules that control access to different parts of your Consul setup, helping ensure security and proper resource allocation within your organization.'
        token-file: |-
            [AI] `consul acl binding-rule read --token-file` is a command used with Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command reads the binding rules of an Access Control List (ACL) in Consul using a token file as authentication.

            The `binding-rule read` subcommand retrieves the specified ACL binding rules. The `--token-file` option specifies the path to a file containing an access token, which is used for authenticating the request and granting permission to perform the read operation on the ACL binding rules.
