    command: '[AI] `tmux list-clients` is a TMUX command used to display a list of currently attached (or running) client sessions. Each line in the output represents one session, showing its session ID, title, and the status (running or attached). This command helps users manage multiple TMUX sessions and quickly identify which ones are active.'

            [AI] `tmux list-clients -F` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to display a list of attached client sessions in a format specified by the `-F` option. The output is typically in the form of a string, and the customization with `-F` allows users to extract specific session information they're interested in. For instance, you might use it like this:

            ```bash
            $ tmux list-clients -F '#S: #T'
            #0: 256x51 (0.0.0.0:2523) (attach)
            #1: 80x24+shell: 256x51 (0.0.0.0:2524) (attached)
            ```

            In the example above, `'#S: #T'` specifies that the output should include the session name `#S` and the terminal title `#T`. This format allows you to quickly identify which sessions are running which processes.
        t: '[AI] The `tmux` command `list-clients -t` is used to display a list of all current `tmux` server sessions and their attached client connections. The `-t` option shows the session title or name. This command helps users manage multiple sessions, identify running sessions, and check which clients are connected to each session.'
