documentation:
    command: '[AI] `yarn config set` is a command used in Yarn, a popular JavaScript package manager. It allows users to set or update key-value pair configurations in their Yarn workspaces or projects. The syntax is as follows: `yarn config set <key> <value>`. For example, `yarn config set proxy http://myproxy.com` sets the HTTP proxy for Yarn''s package fetching. This command modifies the yarn.config.js file in the project root or the package.json file inside each workspace.'
    flag:
        home: '[AI] The command `yarn config set --global --key home value` is used to configure the global Yarn installation''s settings file. Specifically, the `--set` option sets a new configuration variable, and the `--global` flag indicates that the change applies to the Yarn installation in the system''s user directory (rather than in a specific project). The `--key` argument names the configuration property being set, and `value` is the value being assigned to it. This command can be used, for example, to specify an alternate location for storing Yarn packages outside of the default `~/.yarn/` directory.'
        json: '[AI] `yarn config set --json` is a command used in Yarn package manager to set or update key-value pairs in the yarn.lock.json and package.json files in a JSON format. The `--json` option ensures that the data is saved as JSON, allowing for more complex configurations. For example, you can use this command to configure global Yarn settings or modify specific project dependencies. The syntax is `yarn config set <key> <value> --json`.'
