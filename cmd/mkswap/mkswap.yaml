documentation:
    command: '[AI] `mkswap` is a Linux utility command used to create swap files or swap partitions. Swap space is an area on a storage device where the operating system can temporarily store data that is not currently in use, freeing up memory for other processes. When physical memory becomes insufficient, the OS moves less frequently used pages of data from RAM to the swap space. The `mkswap` command formats the given device or file as swap space, preparing it for use by the operating system.'
    flag:
        check: '[AI] `mkswap --check` is a command used in Linux systems to check the validity of a Swap file or Swap partition without modifying it. The Swap space is used by the operating system as an extension of the RAM to store data that is not currently in use. This command verifies that the Swap space is properly formatted and usable, helping to ensure system stability. When executed, `mkswap --check` prints out information about the Swap file or partition, such as its size, creation date, and UUID. If no issues are found, a message indicating the Swap is okay will be displayed. Otherwise, an error message will be shown, providing details on the problem that needs to be addressed.'
        force: '[AI] `mkswap` is a Linux command used to create swap files or swap partitions. The `--force` option is a flag that overrides certain warnings and forces the operation to continue even if potential issues are detected. For example, it may be used when creating a swap file on an existing file system or when the specified block size is not supported by the underlying storage device. By using `mkswap --force`, you acknowledge that potential data loss or other issues might occur and accept the risks associated with the command''s execution.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `mkswap` is a Linux utility for creating swap files or partitions. The `--help` option is used to display detailed information about how to use this command. Here's a brief summary of the output:

            - `mkswap` [OPTIONS] SWAPFILE/DEVICENAME
               - Creates a new swap file or sets up a swap partition.

            Options:

            - --help, -h            Display this help and exit
            - --verbose, -v          Verbosely list progress and actions taken
            - --no-synchronous, -n    Don't fsync() after writing the swap file header
            - --blocksize=BS         Set block size to BS bytes (default 4096)

            Usage:
            1. Create a new empty file of desired size for the swap file
            2. Run mkswap [OPTIONS] SWAPFILE
            3. Edit /etc/fstab or use systemd-swap to configure automatic mounting at boot time
            4. Restart the system for changes to take effect.
        label: '[AI] The `mkswap` command is used to create a swap file or partition on Linux systems. The `--label` option allows specifying a label for the swap file or partition, which can be useful for identification purposes in system tools like `swapon`, `fdisk`, and `fstab`. For example, `sudo mkswap --label="my_data" /path/to/swapfile` creates a swap file with the given label.'
        lock: '[AI] `mkswap --lock` is a command used in Linux to create or modify swap files with the mkswap utility, while setting the locking mechanism to ensure data consistency during the process. The `--lock` option enables advisory locking, which means that other processes attempting to use the same file for swap creation will be blocked until the current process finishes. This helps prevent potential data corruption or inconsistencies when creating or modifying swap files in concurrent environments.'
        pagesize: '[AI] The `mkswap` command is used to create a swap file or partition in Unix-like operating systems. The `--pagesize` option specifies the size of each page in the swap file, which should be a power of 2 between 1 KiB and 64 MiB. By default, the OS selects an optimal page size based on system configuration. However, using `--pagesize` allows manual selection for specific use cases. For example, `mkswap --pagesize 4M file.swap` creates a swap file with 4-megabyte pages.'
        swapversion: '[AI] `mkswap` is a Linux command used to create swap files or swap partitions. The `--swapversion` option specifies the swap file format version to be used. By default, `mkswap` creates swap files using the latest available format, but it can also create swap files with older formats for compatibility with specific systems. For example, `mkswap --swapversion=0x1` creates a swap file in the Linux 1.x format (for use with older kernels), and `mkswap --swapversion=0x4` creates a swap file in the Linux 2.x or 3.x format. The version number is given in hexadecimal, where each digit represents a major or minor version.'
        uuid: '[AI] `mkswap` is a Linux command used to create a swap file or swap partition. The `--uuid` option generates and displays a universally unique identifier (UUID) for the newly created swap area. This UUID can be used in the Linux fstab file for automatic mounting of the swap during system boot. The combination of `mkswap` with the `--uuid` option helps in managing and identifying the swap file or partition efficiently within the system.'
        verbose: '[AI] `mkswap` is a Linux command used to create or reformat a swap file or partition. The `--verbose` option makes the command provide detailed information about its actions during the swap creation or formatting process. This includes printing messages for each step, such as setting up the swap header and allocating memory.'
        version: '[AI] `mkswap` is a command-line utility in Linux used to create swap files or swap partitions. The `--version` option is used to display the version information of the `mkswap` utility installed on the system, including its name, release, version number, and compilation date. This can be helpful for users to check if they have the latest version of `mkswap`, or to identify which version is causing any potential issues.'
