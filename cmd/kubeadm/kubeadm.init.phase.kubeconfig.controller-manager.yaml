    --apiserver-bind-port=: Port for the API Server to bind to.
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save and store the certificates.
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --control-plane-endpoint=: Specify a stable IP address or DNS name for the control plane.
    --kubeconfig-dir=: The path where to save the kubeconfig file.
    --kubernetes-version=: Choose a specific Kubernetes version for the control plane.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm init` command is used to bootstrap a new Kubernetes cluster. When you run this command with the `phase kubeconfig controller-manager` argument, it generates and configures the KubeConfig file specifically for the controller-manager component in your cluster. This file allows you to interact with the Kubernetes APIs as the controller-manager. Once generated, you can use this KubeConfig file to apply cluster configuration changes or manage resources using tools like `kubectl`.'
    flag:
        apiserver-advertise-address: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool for initializing Kubernetes clusters. The `phase kubeconfig controller-manager --apiserver-advertise-address` argument is used to configure the Kubernetes controller-manager service with the IP address that will be advertised as the API server endpoint.

            The `--apiserver-advertise-address` flag sets the IP address of the master node where the Kubernetes API server will listen and be accessible from other nodes in the cluster. The `controller-manager` component is a background process in Kubernetes that runs various system components such as the cluster's DNS server, authentication controller, authorization controller, etc. By specifying this flag during initialization, the controller-manager is configured to communicate with the API server using the provided IP address.
        apiserver-bind-port: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase kubeconfig controller-manager --apiserver-bind-port` argument is specifying the configuration phase for the controller-manager component of Kubernetes, which runs the APIServer, etcd, and other key components that manage the Kubernetes cluster.

            The `--apiserver-bind-port` flag indicates the port number (default is 6443) on which the APIServer, a part of the controller-manager, will listen for incoming API requests. The `kubeconfig` argument generates and configures the Kubernetes configuration file, which allows users to interact with the cluster using `kubectl`.

            This command sets up the initial configuration for managing the controller-manager component and enables secure communication between `kubectl`, other components, and the API server through the generated kubeconfig file.
        cert-dir: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool for initializing a Kubernetes cluster. The specific command `kubeadm init <flags>` you provided is used to initialize a new Kubernetes master node and generate the configuration files required to join worker nodes to the cluster.

            The flag `--phase kubeconfig` indicates that this command will output the kubeconfig file, which contains the client-side configuration for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster.

            The additional flag `controller-manager --cert-dir <path>` specifies the path to a directory containing the certificate and key files for the Kubernetes controller-manager component. The controller-manager is responsible for maintaining the state of the cluster, including managing the etcd database and keeping track of the cluster's nodes and their statuses.

            In summary, `kubeadm init phase kubeconfig controller-manager --cert-dir` generates the kubeconfig file for interacting with a new Kubernetes cluster and specifies the location of the certificate and key files for the controller-manager component.
        config: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The specific command `kubeadm init phase kubeconfig controller-manager --config` generates and configures the kubeconfig file for the controller-manager component in a Kubernetes cluster. This file allows the controller-manager process to communicate with the Kubernetes API server, enabling it to manage various Kubernetes resources and maintain the desired state of the cluster. The `--config` flag specifies the output file path for the generated kubeconfig.'
        control-plane-endpoint: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The given flag `--kubeconfig controller-manager --control-plane-endpoint` sets the controller manager's kubeconfig file and control plane endpoint.

            The controller manager is a key component in a Kubernetes cluster responsible for managing various cluster services like etcd, kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler. This flag tells `kubeadm init` to configure the controller manager with a kubeconfig file (storing authentication information and cluster details) and sets the control plane endpoint, which is the address of the master node's Kubernetes API server.
        kubeconfig-dir: '[AI] The `kubeadm init` command is used to bootstrap a new Kubernetes cluster. When initializing a Kubernetes cluster with `kubeadm`, the `phase kubeconfig controller-manager --kubeconfig-dir` option specifies that `kubeadm` should create and configure the controller-manager''s kubeconfig file in the specified directory (`--kubeconfig-dir`). This kubeconfig file is used by the controller-manager process to communicate with the Kubernetes API server, allowing it to manage the cluster. In summary, this command creates a kubeconfig file for the controller-manager during the initialization of a Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm`.'
        kubernetes-version: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool for bootstrapping a Kubernetes cluster. The specific command `kubeadm init phase kubeconfig controller-manager --kubernetes-version <VERSION>` initiates a new Kubernetes control plane node and generates the controller manager''s kubeconfig file using the specified Kubernetes version (<VERSION>). This kubeconfig file is essential for managing the cluster components as it contains the necessary authentication information. The `controller-manager` component manages various cluster services like the Cluster API Server, Kubelet, and Cloud Controller Manager. By generating its kubeconfig file, you can apply configurations to these services using `kubectl`.'
