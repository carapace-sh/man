description: Freeze execution of unit processes
group: unit
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl freeze` is a command used in Linux systems with systemd as the init system. It creates a new snapshot of the current system state for the creation or modification of an image-based bootable media, such as a Live DVD or Live USB, or for system backups that capture the current system configuration and all running processes. Once the freeze command is executed, no further changes are made to the file systems unless explicitly unmounted, ensuring a consistent snapshot of the system state. The resulting image can then be used to create a new bootable media or restore a previous system state.'
