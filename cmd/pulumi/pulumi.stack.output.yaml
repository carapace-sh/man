    command: '[AI] `pulumi stack output` is a command used in Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform, to retrieve the value of an output variable from a specified stack (an isolated deployment unit). When you run this command with the name of your stack and the output variable, it returns the current value of that output. This can be helpful for retrieving values such as IP addresses or access keys after a successful deployment.'
