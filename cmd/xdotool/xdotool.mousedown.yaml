name: mousedown
description: Send a mousedown for the given button
flags:
    --clearmodifiers: Clear modifiers before clicking
    --delay=: Specify how long, in milliseconds, to delay between clicks
    --repeat=: Specify how many times to click
    --window=: Specify a window to send a click to
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `xdotool` command with the argument `mousedown` is used to simulate a mouse button press event in the X Window System. When executed, it puts the mouse pointer down on its current location without moving it and waits for further instruction, such as specifying a coordinate or window ID to click on. This command can be useful for automating GUI interactions, especially in scripting applications.'
    flag:
        clearmodifiers: '[AI] `xdotool mousedown --clearmodifiers` is a command in xdotool, a cross-platform utility for interacting with X11 applications via the command line. The command performs a mouse button press event without any modifier keys (such as Shift, Control, or Alt) being held down. The `--clearmodifiers` flag ensures that no modifiers are active when the mouse button is pressed.'
        delay: '[AI] `xdotool` is a system tool for automating X Window System interactions. The command `xdotool mousedown --delay <milliseconds>` instructs `xdotool` to simulate a mouse button press (mousedown) with a delay of the specified number of milliseconds before releasing the button. This can be useful in scripts for performing delayed actions or simulations of user interactions with a graphical interface.'
        repeat: '[AI] `xdotool mousedown --repeat` is a command in the xdotool toolset used for automating and interacting with the X Window System graphical environment. This specific command performs a mouse button press (down) event followed by the repetition flag `--repeat`, which instructs it to keep repeating this action continuously until explicitly stopped. The main use case is for simulating extended mouse clicks or drag-and-drop actions in scripts.'
        window: '[AI] The `xdotool` command is a powerful tool for automating interaction with X11 applications from the terminal. The specific command `xdotool mousedown --window <window_id>` instructs it to simulate a mouse button press (in this case, the left button) on the X11 window identified by the given `<window_id>`. This can be used for automating tasks such as clicking buttons or selecting items within an application.'
