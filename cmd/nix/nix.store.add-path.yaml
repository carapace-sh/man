documentation:
    command: '[AI] `nix store add-path` is a command in Nix Package Manager used to add a new directory to the search path of the Nix store, which is a centralized and isolated file tree where Nix builds and stores packages. By running `nix store add-path <path>`, you extend the reach of the package manager to include custom or third-party software that isn''t available in the default Nix channels. This command allows for greater flexibility when managing software with Nix.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] The `nix store add-path --debug` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command adds a new path to the Nix store, which is a central part of Nix''s file hierarchy organization. The `--debug` flag enables verbose output, providing detailed information about the addition process. Overall, it helps in debugging and understanding how Nix manages its files and dependencies.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `nix store add-path` is a command from the Nix Package Manager used to add a new path to the search path for Nix expressions or configurations. The `--dry-run` option is used in testing mode, where the command will simulate the changes that would be made without actually making them. This allows users to preview the impact of their command before executing it in a production environment. In summary, `nix store add-path --dry-run <path>` previews adding the given path to the Nix search path.'
        log-format: |-
            [AI] The `nix store add-path --log-format` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It allows adding a new path to the Nix store, which is a centralized repository of software packages managed by Nix.

            The `add-path` subcommand adds a new directory to the Nix store's search path. The `--log-format` option sets the logging format for the command output, which can be either "plain" (the default) or "json". The logs will be displayed in the specified format, providing more detailed information about the operation.
        name: '[AI] The `nix store add-path` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems, to add a custom path to the Nix store. The `--name` option is used to provide a descriptive name for the added path. For example: `nix store add-path --name my-custom-path /path/to/custom/directory`. This command doesn''t install or manage packages, it just adds a custom directory to the Nix store, allowing other Nix expressions to access it using its given name.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] The `nix store add-path` is a command from the Nix Package Manager used to add a new path to the search path of the Nix expression language. The `--print-build-logs` option requests that the output of the build process for the added path be printed to the console. This can help with debugging and understanding the build process of the software being installed using Nix.'
        quiet: '[AI] `nix store add-path` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This specific command is used to add a new path to Nix''s search path for stores (i.e., repositories of packages). The `--quiet` flag is optional and it instructs the command not to print any messages or progress bars during execution, making the operation run silently in the background.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] The `nix store add-path` command is used to add a new path to Nix's store, which is a part of the Nix Package Manager. This allows users to manage custom or local packages.

            The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output that is displayed during the execution of the command. It provides detailed information about the steps the command takes to add the new path, including the creation and modification of files in the store, allowing for greater transparency and understanding of the underlying process.
