    command: '[AI] `xdotool` is a versatile tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical environment programmatically. The `windowfocus` command is one of its features used to bring the focus to a specific window. When you run `xdotool windowfocus [window ID]`, replace `[window ID]` with the unique identifier of the desired window, this command will transfer the input focus to that window. In other words, it makes that window the active one, allowing you to interact with it.'
    flag:
        sync: |-
            [AI] `xdotool windowfocus --sync` is a command used in the xdotool toolkit, which is a system utility for interacting with X11 applications from the command line or through a script.

            The `windowfocus` subcommand sets the focus to a specific window by its ID or title, bringing it to the front of all other windows. The `--sync` option ensures that the command waits until the window is actually in focus before returning control back to the terminal. This can be useful in automated scripts or tests where it's essential to ensure the window has the input focus before executing further commands.
