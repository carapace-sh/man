documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubeadm init phase kubelet-finalize` is a command used to finalize the Kubelet configuration in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. This command runs after the initial setup of the cluster, such as `kubeadm init`. The Kubelet is a daemon that runs on each node in the cluster, managing pods and containers. In this phase, the necessary system configurations and files are set up for the Kubelet to function correctly, allowing it to register with the cluster''s API server and start managing workloads.'
