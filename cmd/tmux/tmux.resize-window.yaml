        [AI] The `resize-window` command in TMUX is used to change the size of the current pane or window in a TMUX session. By default, it affects only the current pane, but you can target specific panes or windows by specifying their IDs or indexes.

        For example, `resize-pane -t 0.1 30` will resize the second pane in the first row (numbered from top to bottom) of your TMUX session to be 30 characters wider. If you want to resize the current window instead, use `resize-window -t <height>x<width>`.

        These commands can be issued directly from the terminal or via keyboard shortcuts within a TMUX session.
    flag:
        A: '[AI] The `tmux resize-window -A` command is used within the Tmux terminal multiplexer environment to automatically adjust (grow) the height of the selected window in a horizontal layout, making it larger by one unit. The `-A` flag stands for "automatic" and indicates that Tmux should apply this resizing action to any subsequent windows in the same layout as well, maintaining proportions and filling up the available terminal space.'
        D: '[AI] `tmux resize-window -D` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to dynamically adjust the size of the terminal window downward. The "-D" flag stands for "down," indicating that only the height of the selected terminal pane will be reduced, maintaining its width and aspect ratio. This command helps users adapt to changing terminal environments or to make optimal use of available screen space.'
        L: '[AI] The command `tmux resize-window -L` is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to resize the current window to the left. The `-L` option signifies a leftward shift in the size of the window, making it smaller horizontally and potentially larger vertically if other windows are resized accordingly. This command can be helpful when working with multiple panes or windows within TMUX sessions.'
        R: '[AI] `tmux resize-window -R` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to resize the currently selected window to the dimensions of the terminal sending the command. The `-R` flag indicates that the size adjustment should be applied to the root window, rather than any nested windows within it.'
        U: |-
            [AI] The `tmux` command `resize-window -U` is used to resize the upper pane or window in a Tmux terminal multiplexer session. The `-U` option specifies that only the upper pane should be affected by the resizing operation.

            For example, if you have two vertically split panes and want to make the upper one taller, you would use:
            ```
            tmux resize-pane -U <number_of_lines>
            ```
            Replace `<number_of_lines>` with the number of lines you want to add to the upper pane.
        a: '[AI] `tmux resize-pane -A` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to resize the active pane (or window) automatically, adjusting its height or width proportionally to fill the available space. The "-A" flag stands for "automatic," meaning tmux will distribute the extra space evenly among all panes in the same direction (horizontal or vertical) to maintain a balanced layout.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux resize-window` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to resize the dimensions of an existing window pane. The `-t` option specifies the target window or pane identifier. So, the complete command `tmux resize-window -t <identifier>` resizes the identified window based on given arguments, typically providing new height and width values.'
        x: '[AI] `tmux resize-window` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer software. The `-x` option specifies that only the width of the selected window will be resized. For example, `tmux resize-pane -X 100` would increase the width of the active pane by 100 units. Similarly, `tmux resize-window -t <window-id> -x 50` would resize window with the given id to be 50 units wider. This command allows users to dynamically adjust their terminal layouts as needed.'
        "y": '[AI] `tmux resize-window` is a command used in the tmux terminal multiplexer to resize the height (with `-y`) of an existing window. When you run this command followed by the height value to set, tmux will adjust the selected window accordingly, maintaining its aspect ratio if the `-A` flag is not specified. For instance, `tmux resize-window -t <window-id> -y <height>` would resize the height of the window identified by `<window-id>` to `<height>` pixels.'
