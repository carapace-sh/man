description: Disable a plugin
flags:
    -f, --force: Force the disable of an active plugin
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker plugin disable` command is used to disable a Docker plugin in the Docker daemon. Plugins extend the functionality of Docker and can be disabled if they are not needed, freeing up system resources. To use this command, provide the name or ID of the plugin as an argument: `docker plugin disable <plugin-name>` or `docker plugin disable <plugin-id>`. The plugin will no longer be available for use until it is re-enabled.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The `docker plugin disable --force` command is used to forcibly disable a Docker plugin, even if it''s currently in use by one or more containers. When you run this command without the `--force` option, Docker will refuse to disable the plugin due to active container dependencies. With `--force`, Docker will override these dependencies and disable the plugin anyway, potentially causing issues with any affected containers. It''s important to only use the `--force` flag when you have a clear understanding of the implications and are confident that there won''t be negative consequences.'
