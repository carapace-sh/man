documentation:
    command: '[AI] `apt-cache rdepends` is a command used in Debian-based Linux distributions to show the direct and reverse dependencies of a given package. Direct dependencies are packages that the specified package depends on, while reverse dependencies are packages that depend on the specified package. This command retrieves this information from the local package index cache (apt-cache), rather than querying the online repositories, making it faster to use when working offline or with slow internet connections.'
