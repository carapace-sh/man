    command: '[AI] The `docker config` command is a subcommand of Docker used to manage configuration files for Docker applications. The specific command `docker config ls` lists all the configured contexts, images, and services in your Docker environment along with their associated configuration files and their paths. It provides information about the existing configurations without applying or modifying any settings.'
    flag:
        filter: '[AI] `docker config ls --filter` is a command used in Docker to list all the configured contexts, files and secrets stored in the Docker configuration directory (usually located at `~/.docker/config.json`). The filter option allows specifying various filters to narrow down the output based on different criteria such as type (context or file), name or key-value pairs. For instance, `--filter key=name,value` will list only the contexts or files with a specified name or secret with a specific key-value pair.'
        format: '[AI] `docker config ls --format` is a command used with Docker to list the configured contexts and their associated files. The `--format` option allows specifying an output format using Go template syntax for customized output. No files are modified or created with this command, it simply displays the configuration details of available contexts in the Docker daemon.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `docker config ls --quiet` command is used to list all configured contexts and their associated context keys in Docker in a minimal output format. This means that only the name and key of each context will be displayed, without any extra information or formatting. It''s often used in scripts for automation purposes.'
