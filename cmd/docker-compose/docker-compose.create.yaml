name: create [OPTIONS] [SERVICE...]
description: Creates containers for a service.
flags:
    --build: Build images before starting containers.
    --force-recreate: Recreate containers even if their configuration and image haven't changed.
    --no-build: Don't build an image, even if it's policy.
    --no-recreate: If containers already exist, don't recreate them. Incompatible with --force-recreate.
    --pull=: Pull image before running ("always"|"missing"|"never"|"build")
    --remove-orphans: Remove containers for services not defined in the Compose file.
    --scale*=: Scale SERVICE to NUM instances. Overrides the `scale` setting in the Compose file if present.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker-compose create` is a command used with Docker Compose files to create and configure containers based on the service definitions specified in the file. When you run this command, Docker Compose builds any necessary images based on the Dockerfiles or external image sources listed in the Compose file. It then creates and starts the defined containers, networks, and volumes. Essentially, it sets up the entire application stack as defined in your Compose file.'
    flag:
        build: |-
            [AI] `docker-compose create --build` is a command used with Docker Compose to create and build new Docker containers based on the defined services in a `docker-compose.yml` file.

            The `create` subcommand creates new containers for the services defined in the YAML file, but does not start them yet. The `--build` flag instructs Docker Compose to build any new images required for the services from their respective Dockerfiles before creating the containers. This can help ensure that the latest version of each image is used when creating the containers.

            In summary, `docker-compose create --build` creates and builds new Docker containers from the defined services in a `docker-compose.yml` file.
        force-recreate: '[AI] `docker-compose create --force-recreate` is a command used with Docker Compose to create and recreate containers defined in a docker-compose.yml file, even if their corresponding containers are already running. The `--force-recreate` option ensures that new containers will be created from their defined images, overwriting any existing containers. This can be useful when making changes to Dockerfile or other configuration files that require container recreation without losing data in the containers.'
        no-build: '[AI] `docker-compose create --no-build` is a command used to create new Docker containers based on existing Compose files without building any images from scratch. The `--no-build` flag instructs Docker Compose not to execute the build process for any services defined in the Compose file. Instead, it creates new containers using images that are already available in your local Docker registry or the public Docker Hub. This command only changes the container state and does not modify the Compose file itself or make any changes to existing containers.'
        no-recreate: '[AI] `docker-compose create --no-recreate` is a command used to create new Docker containers based on the service definitions in a `docker-compose.yml` file without destroying and recreating any existing containers that have the same image, network, or name. This can be useful when making changes to the configuration files but not wanting to disrupt running containers. If new containers are created with the same name as an existing container, they will be appended with a number to make them distinct.'
        pull: '[AI] `docker-compose create --pull` is a command used with Docker Compose to create and configure new Docker applications defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. The `--create` flag creates and configure services, networks, and volumes as specified in the file. The `--pull` flag tells Docker Compose to pull any new images required for the service definitions before creating the containers. This ensures that the most up-to-date images are used when starting new containers.'
        remove-orphans: '[AI] `docker-compose create` is a command used to create and configure Docker services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. The `--remove-orphans` option specifies that containers for services which already have running instances should be removed before creating new ones. This can help ensure that only the specified configuration is running, avoiding unexpected or unwanted container instances.'
        scale: '[AI] `docker-compose create --scale` is a command used with Docker Compose files to create and start services defined in the file, as well as set a specific number of replicas for each service using the `--scale` option. This means that for each service, a specified number of identical containers will be created and run, allowing for easy scaling of multi-container applications.'
