description: Shut down and reboot the system with kexec
group: system
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `systemctl kexec` command is not a valid command in Linux systems using systemd as the init system. There is no such command defined by systemd or the Linux Kernel Execute Control (kexec) utility. The `systemctl` command is used to manage and control the systemd system and service manager, while `kexec` is a separate utility that allows for kernel updates and reboots without unloading the current runtime environment. To use kexec, one would typically boot the system with the new kernel as the initial kernel, or use a special bootloader command to load the new kernel and perform the kexec update.'
