documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea notifications unread` command is used in the Terminal-based email client called "Tea" to display a list of emails that have unread notifications. This command filters the notification list to show only those emails with unread messages, helping users to quickly focus on new or important emails.'
    flag:
        limit: '[AI] The `tea notifications unread --limit` command is used in Terminal, specifically with the tea (Tui Engine for Application Notifications) tool. This command retrieves the number of unread notifications from all applications supported by tea and displays it, up to a maximum limit specified by the user. For instance, `tea notifications unread --limit 5` will display the number of unread notifications for each application but will only show the top 5 applications with unread notifications.'
        login: '[AI] The `--login` flag in the command `tea notifications unread --login` is used to specify that the operation should be performed using a specific tea account with login credentials. The `unread` argument indicates that the command will show or mark as read, any unread notifications for that account. Tea is a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for managing notifications from various sources such as emails, social media platforms, and messaging apps.'
        mine: '[AI] The `tea notifications unread --mine` command is a part of the Tea (Temporal Event Album) project, which is a tool for managing and querying event data in a unified way. This specific command filters the displayed list of notifications to only show those that are marked as "unread" and belong to the currently authenticated user ("mine"). It does not include any additional context information in its explanation.'
        output: |-
            [AI] The `tea` command with the flags `--notifications` and `--unread` is used in the Terminal application on macOS to check for new notifications from applications that support Notification Center.

            The `--output` flag specifies that the output of the command should be printed to the terminal instead of being displayed as a notification or badge count on the application icon.

            Therefore, `tea --notifications unread --output` will display the number of unread notifications in the Terminal window.
        page: |-
            [AI] The `--flag tea notifications unread --page` command is related to the `tea` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for interacting with the Teaspoon notification system.

            This flag is used to retrieve the list of unread notifications, starting from the oldest one on the specified page. The number of notifications per page can be adjusted by providing a different value after `--page`. If no value is provided after `--page`, the default value is typically 25 notifications per page.

            For example: `tea notifications unread --page 3` would display notifications that are marked as "unread" and have not been displayed on the user interface before, starting from the third page of results.
        remote: '[AI] The `--flag tea notifications unread --remote` is a command used in the Tea interface for GitHub, a graphical client for interacting with GitHub repositories. This flag filters notifications to only show those with unread messages and fetches them remotely from the GitHub server instead of checking locally. It helps users keep track of new activity on their repositories without having to manually refresh or check for updates.'
        repo: '[AI] The `--unread` flag with `tea notifications` command in GitHub''s Terminal (or `tea`) tool is used to display unread notification alerts for a specific repository. When using this flag, the output will only show the repositories where there are new notifications waiting to be read.'
        states: '[AI] The `--states` option in the `tea notify` command with the `unread` sub-command in the Tea (Terminal Emulation Administration) tool is used to retrieve the list of channels and topics with unread notifications. This command does not create or modify any state, it only reads and displays the current number of unread notifications for each channel and topic.'
