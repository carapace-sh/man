    command: '[AI] The `tmux pipe-pane` is a command in TMUX, the terminal multiplexer, which allows you to send the output of a pane to another pane or external command as input. It captures the standard output of the selected pane and sends it as stdin to another command or pane. This can be useful for chaining commands, piping outputs between panes, or transferring data between sessions. The basic syntax is `tmux send-keys <pane> pipe:<command/pane>`. For example, `tmux send-keys -t 0.1 pipe:cat file.txt` sends the output of pane 0.1 to the ''cat'' command in pane 2.'
    flag:
        I: '[AI] `tmux pipe-pane` is a command in the `tmux` terminal multiplexer. The `-I` option stands for "interactive." It creates a new pane inside an existing tmux session and connects it to the standard input, output, and error streams of an external command. This allows you to run the external command within tmux and have its output displayed in the connected pane. The pipe (`|`) symbolizes the flow of data between the external command and the pane. For instance, `tmux new-session ''command'' pipe-pane -I | some_editor` would start a new session running ''command'', then create an interactive pane connected to ''some\_editor''.'
        O: '[AI] `tmux pipe-pane -O` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to create a pane where the input and output are connected via a pipeline. The `-O` flag specifies that tmux should set the option "send-keys-as-prefix" off for this pane, meaning that characters sent to the pane will not be interpreted as Tmux commands but instead will be passed directly through the pipeline. This is useful when working with external commands or tools where you don''t want Tmux to interfere with the input and output.'
        o: '[AI] `tmux pipe-pane` is a command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, used to send output of a pane to another pane or external command. The option `-o` stands for "send output" and instructs tmux to send the output of the selected pane instead of taking input from it. With `pipe-pane -o`, you can redirect the output of one pane into another pane, creating a pipeline effect within your terminal sessions in TMUX.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux pipe-pane -t` is a command in Tmux (Terminal Multiplexer), which creates a new pane within the current window and executes a command piped to it. The "-t" option sets a label for the pane, making it easier to identify when working with multiple panes. The entire command, `tmux new-pane -t <label> "$(command)"`, creates a new labeled pane and runs the specified command within that pane.'
