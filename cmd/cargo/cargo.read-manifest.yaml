            [AI] `cargo read-manifest` is a command provided by Cargo, the Rust package manager. The `--help` flag is used to display detailed help information about this command.

            When you run `cargo read-manifest --help`, it will print out usage information including:

            1. A brief description of what the command does: It reads and prints out the contents of a Cargo manifest file.
            2. The syntax or usage of the command, with placeholders for required arguments: `$ cargo read-manifest <MANIFEST_PATH>`
            3. Information about optional flags that can be used with the command to modify its behavior.
            4. Examples of how to use the command effectively.

            This command is particularly useful when you want to inspect or programmatically access the data in a Cargo manifest file without having to parse it yourself.
        manifest-path: '[AI] The `cargo read-manifest` command is a part of Rust''s package manager, Cargo. It is used to read the contents of a Cargo manifest file. The `--manifest-path` option specifies the path to the manifest file. When you run `cargo read-manifest --manifest-path <PATH>`, it will output the parsed JSON representation of the manifest file located at that path. This can be useful for programmatically accessing and processing the information in a Cargo manifest, such as project name, version number, dependencies, etc.'
        quiet: '[AI] `cargo read-manifest` is a command in Rust''s Cargo build tool. The `--quiet` flag is used to suppress all output except for errors and warnings, making the command run silently. Essentially, it prints only the manifest data of the specified project without any additional information or progress updates.'
