    command: '[AI] `tig` is a Git interface for terminal and graphical text modes, which provides an efficient way to navigate, search, and interact with your Git repositories using keyboard shortcuts. It''s particularly useful for exploring large or complex projects with multiple branches or commits. The command itself doesn''t exist in the default Git setup; instead, you would install and use `tig` as a separate tool alongside Git.'
    flag:
        C: '[AI] The `tig` command is a Git file explorer for the terminal. The option `-C` is used to enable Case-Sensitive search when using this tool. This means that searches conducted with `tig` will differentiate between uppercase and lowercase characters, making it useful when working with files containing code or other text where case matters.'
        help: '[AI] `tig` is a Git client for interactive exploration of Git repos. The `--help` option, when used with `tig`, displays detailed help information about all available commands and their usage. For instance, running `tig --help` in the terminal provides an overview of various TIG sub-commands like `checkout`, `log`, `stash`, etc., along with their options and usage examples. To learn more about a specific command, run `tig <command> --help`.'
        version: '[AI] `tig` is a Git interface for terminal power users, developed by Tatusko Tango. The command `tig --version` is used to display the version information of the installed `tig` tool. When executed in a terminal or command-line interface, it prints out the version number and any associated commit hash, branch name, and build information. It''s important for users to check their installed version when troubleshooting issues or seeking compatibility with other Git tools.'
