documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `jj untrack` command is used in the version control system, Mercurial (or JetBrains'' IntelliJ IDEA''s integrated Mercurial interface), to remove a file or directory from being tracked by the version control system. This means that any changes made to the file will no longer be committed or rolled back when working with your repository. It is equivalent to the Git command `rm --cached <file>`.'

        help: |-
            [AI] `jj untrack` is a command used in the JIRA CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, which allows managing Jira issues from the terminal. The `--help` option is used to display detailed information about how to use this specific command.

            When you run `jj untrack --help`, it provides the following information:

            - Action: 'untrack' is an action that removes the local changes in the working directory, effectively detaching the current branch from the local repository and discarding all uncommitted changes.
            - Untracking a file does not delete it from your filesystem. It only removes the Git tracking information for the file.
            - Usage: `jj untrack [FILE]...` - to untrack one or more files, or `jj untrack .` - to untrack all changes in the current directory.
            - When using with Jira issues, it may not have any effect as this command is primarily used for Git management and not directly related to managing Jira issues.
