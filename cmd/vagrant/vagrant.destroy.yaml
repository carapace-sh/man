name: destroy
description: stops and deletes all traces of the vagrant machine
flags:
    --no-parallel: Disable parallelism if provider supports it (automatically enables force)
    --parallel: Enable parallelism if provider supports it (automatically enables force)
    -f, --force: Destroy without confirmation.
    -g, --graceful: Gracefully poweroff of VM
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vagrant destroy` is a Vagrant command used to stop and delete a previously created virtual machine (VM) or container environment managed by Vagrant. It shuts down the VM gracefully, then deletes its associated files and directory in the local Vagrant working directory. Running this command will result in the loss of all data stored within the VM, so it should only be used when intentional.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `vagrant destroy --force` is a Vagrant command used to delete and completely remove all files and directories created by a Vagrant project, along with the associated virtual machine (VM) or container. The `--force` option ensures that this action cannot be undone, as it skips confirmations and forcibly terminates the VM or container, if running. It is often used when it''s necessary to clean up a failed setup or when migrating to another infrastructure provider.'
        graceful: '[AI] `vagrant destroy --graceful` is a Vagrant command used to destroy and stop all running Vagrant virtual machines or containers in a graceful manner. Graceful shutdown sends a SIGTERM signal, allowing the guest operating system to perform an orderly shutdown, which can help avoid data loss or other issues. This option ensures that any running processes are given time to finish before the VM is completely destroyed.'
        no-parallel: '[AI] The `vagrant destroy` command with the `--no-parallel` option is used to destroy all Vagrant managed virtual machines or containers in a single project directory. The `--no-parallel` flag ensures that Vagrant destroys each machine one at a time, rather than in parallel, which can be helpful when dealing with resource constraints or wanting more control over the destruction process.'
        parallel: '[AI] `vagrant destroy --parallel` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command instructs Vagrant to destroy all the running Virtual Machines (VMs) or containers in parallel mode. By default, Vagrant destroys each VM one at a time, but using `--parallel` flag enables it to destroy multiple VMs simultaneously, potentially reducing the overall destruction time. Note that using this option might require more system resources and could lead to conflicts if certain resources are shared among the VMs.'
