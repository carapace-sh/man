documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pamac list` command is a Pacman-Archive-Keyring (PAK) manager command used in Arch Linux and its derivatives to display available packages and their versions in the system''s keyring repository. This command doesn''t install or update packages but provides an up-to-date inventory of package versions for offline use or comparisons with other repositories. It can help users plan their software upgrades and make informed decisions about package choices.'
    flag:
        files: '[AI] The `pamac list --files` command is a function of Pamac, a package manager for Arch Linux. This specific command displays a list of files that would be affected by installing or upgrading a particular package. It helps users understand the impact of their actions before making changes to their system.'
        foreign: '[AI] `pamac list --foreign` is a command from Pamac, a package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. The `--foreign` option filters the list of installed packages to show only those that were installed using methods other than Pacman, Arch Linux''s default package manager. This can include packages installed via other repositories or installations from sources outside the package manager. The output typically includes the name, version, and repository or installation location for each foreign package.'
        groups: '[AI] `pamac list --groups` is a command used in the Pamac package manager for the Arch Linux distribution. This command displays a list of all available groups of packages in the system. Each group represents a collection of packages that share a common theme, such as development tools, multimedia codecs, or desktop environments. These groups help in managing and installing related packages together with ease.'
        installed: '[AI] `pamac list --installed` is a command used in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. It lists all installed packages in the system, displaying their names, versions, and other relevant information. This command helps users to check which packages are currently installed on their system and keep track of their software inventory.'
        orphans: '[AI] `pamac list --orphans` is a command in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux. It lists packages that have no dependencies, meaning they are not currently installed but were once required by other packages that have since been removed or updated. These "orphan" packages can be safely removed if no longer needed to free up disk space and simplify the system''s package database.'
        quiet: '[AI] `pamac list --quiet` is a command from Pamac, a Pacman front-end for Arch Linux package management. This command displays a quiet or minimal output, listing only the installed packages without any extra information such as version numbers or installation dates.'
        repos: '[AI] `pamac list --repos` is a command in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux. This command lists all available repositories currently configured in the system, displaying their names and the enabled or disabled status. Repositories define where Pacman downloads software packages from to install or update. The output also includes information about each repository''s priority, which determines the order of package installation when multiple versions exist.'
