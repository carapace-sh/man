        [AI] `gh issue` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to interact with GitHub issues. It allows you to create, view, update, or manage issues in a repository from your terminal. You can use it to:

        * Create a new issue by running `gh issue create <repository> <title> --body "<description>"`
        * View an issue by running `gh issue view <issue-number>`
        * Update an existing issue by running `gh issue edit <issue-number>` and then using your preferred text editor to modify the contents before committing the changes.
        * Close or reopen issues by running `gh issue close <issue-number>` or `gh issue reopen <issue-number>`.
        * Search for issues using keywords with `gh issue search --keywords "<search-term>"`.
