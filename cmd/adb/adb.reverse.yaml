description: reverse socket connection
flags:
    --list: list all reverse socket connections from device
    --no-rebind: don't replace existing connection
    --remove: remove specific reverse socket connection
    --remove-all: remove all reverse socket connection
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `adb reverse` command in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is used to set up a reverse TCP connection from a device to the host machine. This allows incoming traffic on a specified port from other devices or networks, which can be useful for certain development or testing scenarios, such as serving content from a device or creating a server on the device to receive data. The general syntax is `adb reverse <protocol>:<local-port>:<remote-address>:<remote-port>`.'
    flag:
        list: '[AI] The `adb reverse --list` command is used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to list all the local and remote ports that have been set up for port forwarding between the development machine and an Android device. This command helps developers to check which ports are currently being forwarded, allowing them to manage and troubleshoot their connections more effectively.'
        no-rebind: |-
            [AI] `adb reverse` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to establish a bidirectional tunnel between the device and the host machine for data transfer. The `--no-rebind` option disables ADB's automatic port mapping feature.

            By using this flag, you specify explicitly the source and target ports for the tunnel on both the device and the host machine. For instance, if you run `adb reverse tcp:8080:localhost:8080`, ADB will create a persistent socket pair on the device and the host with the given ports without remapping them to free ephemeral ports. This can be useful when working with third-party applications or services that require specific port configurations.
        remove: '[AI] `adb reverse --remove` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB). It reverses a port forwarding rule set up with `adb forward`, allowing inbound connections from a host to a device or emulator. The `--remove` option removes an existing port forwarding rule. No new rule is added when using this command alone, and the connection will be terminated after removal if there''s an active session.'
        remove-all: '[AI] `adb reverse --remove-all` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB), which is a versatile tool for communicating with an Android device. This specific command is used to remove all the port forwardings that have been set up using `adb forward` or `adb reverse`. The `--remove-all` option ensures that all existing mappings are terminated, effectively resetting the configuration back to its default state.'
