documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `jj branch untrack` command is used in the Mercurial version control system. It removes a branch from the local list of tracked branches, meaning that Mercurial will no longer automatically fetch or merge changes from that branch when pulling or merging. This can be useful if you want to keep a reference to an old branch without actively working on it. However, keep in mind that any local changes made to the files in this branch will not be affected by this command and you''ll still need to manually apply any necessary updates if needed.'

        help: |-
            [AI] `jj branch untrack` is a Git command used with the Jira JIRA CLI tool (jj) to untrack a branch in your local Git repository, removing it as a known branch but keeping the commits in your local repository. This can be useful if you have created a branch based on a now-outdated or incorrect commit, or if you want to discard changes made on a branch without pushing them.

            The `--help` option provides detailed information about how to use this command, including any flags that can modify its behavior. Here's an example output:

            ```sh
            $ jj branch untrack --help
            Usage: jj branch untrack [<branch>]

            Untracks a Git branch from your local repository. This means Jira will no longer recognize the branch when you push or pull changes, but the commits will remain in your local repository. If no branch is specified, the current branch will be used.

            Options:
              -f, --force             Force untrack this branch without asking for confirmation
              -d, --delete             Delete the branch locally once it has been untracked
              --help                  Show help information and exit
            ```
