documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git commit-tree` is a Git command used to create a new commit object without going through the interactive commit message prompting process. It takes as arguments the tree object to be committed, the parent commit(s), and an optional message. The new commit will have the given parents and the specified message or no message if omitted. The result is a new commit hash that can be used in further Git operations.'
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `git commit-tree -F` is a Git command used to create a new commit object without going through the interactive commit message editing process. The `-F` option tells Git to read the tree and parent commit information from a file instead of creating them interactively. This can be useful for creating commits programmatically or in scripts, as it allows for more control over the commit''s contents.'
        gpg-sign: '[AI] `git commit-tree --gpg-sign` is a Git command used to create a new committed tree object and sign it with a GPG key. This command takes a tree object as its argument, which represents the snapshot to be committed. By adding `--gpg-sign` option, Git will generate a new signature for the committed object using the default GPG key configured for your Git user settings. Once signed, the new commit is not yet added to the current branch, but you can create a new branch or amend an existing one with this new committed tree. This command ensures the integrity and authenticity of the committed data by adding digital signatures to the Git objects.'
        m: '[AI] `git commit-tree` is a Git command used to create a new commit object with the given tree, i.e., snapshot of file changes. The `-m` option sets the commit message for the new commit. Therefore, `git commit-tree -m "commit message"` creates and commits a new commit with the specified tree and message.'
        p: '[AI] `git commit-tree` is a Git command for creating a new commit object without going through the interactive commit message editing process. The `-p` option specifies that this new commit should be a parent of the tree specified by the given SHA-1 or ref. In other words, it creates a new commit with the given tree as its parent, effectively creating a new branch point or modifying an existing one. This can be useful for committing intermediary changes during a merge conflict resolution process, for instance.'
