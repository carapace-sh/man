documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl unmask` is a command used in Linux systems to remove the mask from a systemd unit file, enabling it to be managed by systemd. When a mask is applied to a unit file, it prevents the file from being enabled or started by default at boot time. By removing the mask with `systemctl unmask`, the corresponding unit can be manually enabled or started using `systemctl enable` or `systemctl start`.'
