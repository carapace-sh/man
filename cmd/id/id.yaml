documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `id` command in Unix or Linux systems is used to display the real and effective User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) of the current user or any specified user. When run without arguments, it shows the details for the currently logged-in user. By providing a username as an argument, the output will display the UID and GID associated with that user.'
    flag:
        a: '[AI] `id -a` is a Linux command used to display detailed user and group information. The `-a` option stands for "all," which means it will show both the effective User ID (UID), Effective Group ID (GID), Supplementary Group IDs, and other related information. This command helps in troubleshooting permissions, identifying user/group relationships, and understanding the system''s security context.'
        context: '[AI] The `id` command with the `--context` option is used in Linux to display the user and group information for the current process or a specified process, along with the corresponding context (i.e., the file or namespace where the process is running). This option provides more detailed information compared to the regular `id` command, which only displays the user and group memberships of the current user.'
        group: '[AI] The `id` command with the `--group` option is used in Linux and Unix-based systems to display information about the primary group of a given user or process, including its name and group ID (GID). For example, running `id --group <username>` will output something like "`5:groupe name:`", indicating that the user''s primary group has a GID of 5 and the name "groupe name". This information can be useful for understanding the group memberships and permissions associated with a particular user or process.'
        groups: '[AI] The `id --groups` command is a Linux utility used to display the GID (Group ID) numbers and corresponding group names of the user specified. It''s primarily used for debugging or auditing purposes to understand which groups a particular user belongs to. When executed, it prints out the user''s UID (User ID), followed by the list of their associated GID numbers and group names. The information is displayed in three columns: the first column shows the Group Name, the second column shows the GID number, and the third column shows the corresponding base group name.'
        help: '[AI] The `id` command with the `--help` option is used to display help information about the `id` utility in Unix-like operating systems. It provides a clear and concise explanation of how to use the `id` command, including its syntax, available options, and examples. The output includes a brief description of what the `id` command does (i.e., displays user and group information for the current process or a specified user), as well as detailed explanations of each option, their meanings, and any associated arguments.'
        name: '[AI] The `id` command with the `--name` option in Linux or Unix-based systems is used to display the hostname or the name of the operating system and release of the Linux distribution running on the system. For example, `id --name` might output something like "Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS" or "fedora.localdomain". This information can be useful for system identification purposes.'
        real: |-
            [AI] The `id --real` command is a Linux utility used to display the current user and group information associated with the current user ID (UID) or group ID (GID). The `--real` option ensures that only the name of the actual user or group is displayed, without showing any aliases or appended suffixes like "@DOMAIN" for system users. For instance, if user "john" has UID 1001 and belongs to group "users" with GID 1002, running `id --real` would output:

            ```bash
            uid=1001(john) gid=1002(users) groups=1002(users)
            ```
        user: '[AI] The `id` command with the `-u` option (`id --user`) is used in Unix and Linux systems to display detailed user and group information. It shows the user name, UID (unique identifier), GID (group identifier), and any supplementary groups for the current user or for a specified user if provided as an argument. This can be helpful in identifying the specific user or understanding the user''s associated groups.'
        version: '[AI] The `id --version` command is used with the GNU ID utility to check the version of the installed ID software. When executed in a terminal or command prompt, it displays the version number and some optional information such as the compilation date and operating system. This can help users ensure they have the latest version or troubleshoot compatibility issues.'
        zero: '[AI] The `id --zero` command is not a valid Linux command. The `id` command in Linux is used to display the current user and group IDs for the current user or for a specified user. It does not take a `--zero` option. If you meant to ask about other commands with similar names, please provide more context or the correct command name for an accurate explanation.'
