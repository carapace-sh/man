    command: '[AI] `kubectl config get-contexts` is a Kubernetes command used to list all available contexts in your `kubeconfig` file. A Kubernetes context is essentially a collection of cluster and user configuration settings that allows you to connect to a specific cluster. This command helps users manage multiple clusters or projects by providing a clear overview of the contexts they can switch between.'
    flag:
        no-headers: '[AI] The command `kubectl config get-contexts --no-headers` retrieves a list of available Kubernetes contexts in your local `kubeconfig` file, without displaying the headers or column titles. Each line represents a context and contains its name. This command is useful when you need to process the output programmatically, such as parsing it with scripts or other tools.'
        output: '[AI] `kubectl config get-contexts --output` is a command used with the Kubernetes command-line tool (kubectl) to list all available Kubernetes clusters or contexts configured in your local kubeconfig file. The `--output` flag specifies the output format, which can be set to `json` or `yaml` to display the output in those formats. By default, the command outputs a list of context names. This command is useful when you want to check which clusters you have configured and switch between them easily.'
