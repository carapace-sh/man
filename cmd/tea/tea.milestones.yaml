documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea milestones` command is not a standard Unix or Linux command. It appears to be specific to TEA (TeamEngine Accelerate), a project management tool for Agile software development created by Perforce Software. This command is likely used to display the current project milestones within TEA, which may include details such as start and end dates, descriptions, and completion statuses. However, without access to the actual TEA application or documentation, this explanation is based on speculation. For more accurate information, please refer to the official TEA user guide or contact Perforce Software support.'
    flag:
        fields: '[AI] The `tea milestones --fields` command is used in Jenkins, a continuous integration and delivery tool. It retrieves information about the specified milestones of a Jenkins project, including their names and the build numbers associated with each milestone. The `--fields` option allows specifying which fields should be returned in the output. This command can be used to programmatically access milestone data from Jenkins using tools like cURL or the Jenkins API.'
        limit: '[AI] The `tea milestones --limit` command is a sub-command of the TAP (Test Anything Protocol) testing framework in Perl, specifically used with the Test::Harness distribution. This command displays the list of test cases that have been run, along with their status (passed or failed), but it only shows the most recent result for each test case. The `--limit` option specifies the maximum number of test cases to display in this summary format. It helps to quickly assess the execution results without being overwhelmed by excessive output when dealing with a large set of tests.'
        login: '[AI] The `tea milestones --login` command is used in TestLink, a open source test management tool. This command is used to log into the TestLink interface with specified credentials for managing test projects and executions. The `--login` flag indicates that only the login process should be executed, without further actions like loading a specific project or test suite.'
        output: '[AI] `tea milestones --output` is a command in Testing Ever Green (TEA) framework for Jenkins. It generates an output displaying key milestones or checkpoints of a TEA cycle, such as start time, end time, and status of each milestone. The `--output` option specifies the format of the output, typically in JSON, XML or TSV format to be consumed by other tools or scripts for further processing.'
        page: '[AI] The `tea milestones --page` command is a sub-command used in the Jenkins Continuous Integration (CI) tool, specifically within the Jenkins Pipeline plugin. This command is used to display the details of specific Milestones defined in a Jenkins Pipeline script. The `--page` option indicates that multiple pages of milestone information should be displayed if there are more than ten milestones defined. It helps developers and team members monitor the progress of pipeline projects with clearly defined stages or phases, making it easier to identify issues and keep track of project advancements.'
        remote: '[AI] The `tea milestones --remote` command is a part of TEA (TeamEngineApp), an open-source GitOps continuous delivery and deployment tool built on top of Fluentd, Confluence, and Kubernetes. This command is used to retrieve the list of milestones from a remote Git repository over HTTPS. The `--remote` flag indicates that the Git URL provided will be for a remote repository instead of a local one. It helps teams collaborate on deployments by keeping track of different branches or releases in their Git workflows.'
        repo: '[AI] The `tea milestones --repo` command is used in GitHub''s TEA (Test and Deploy) CLI tool to list milestones for a specific repository. It doesn''t create, update or delete milestones, just displays them. This command can be helpful for understanding the progress of development in a project by providing an overview of established milestones.'
        state: '[AI] The `--state` option in the `tea milestones` command is used to filter milestones based on their current state. It accepts the following states: "all", "open", "closed", or a specific milestone ID. By default, it shows all milestones, but using this option allows you to view only the open or closed ones or focus on a single milestone.'
