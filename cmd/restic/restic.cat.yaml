documentation:
    command: '[AI] `restic cat` is a command used with the data backup tool called restic. It''s not actually a standalone command, but an alias for `restic show` followed by `grep` or `awk` or other text processing commands, depending on your specific use case. The purpose of `restic cat` is to extract and display specific information from the backups created with restic without having to restore the entire backup first. This can save time and resources when dealing with large backups or when only a small piece of data is needed.'
