documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `unxz` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems used for extracting compressed files that have been saved in the .gz or .gzip format. When you run `unxz filename.gz`, it decompresses the file and saves the original content as a new file with the same name but without the .gz extension by default.'
