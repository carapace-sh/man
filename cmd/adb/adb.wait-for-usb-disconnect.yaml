documentation:
    command: '[AI] `adb wait-for-usb-disconnect` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to wait for the USB connection between an Android device and the computer to be disconnected before executing subsequent commands. This can be useful when you want to ensure that your script or command does not interfere with the normal USB function of your device, such as when using a USB OTG cable or charging the device via USB. The command blocks further execution until the device is no longer connected to the USB.'
