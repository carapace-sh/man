documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `yarn stage` command is a part of Yarn Workflow, which allows you to define and execute multi-step workflows. Each step in a workflow represents a distinct phase in the build or release process. The `stage` command is used to define and run stages in a Yarn Workflow file. For example, you might have stages for testing, building, and deploying your application. When you run `yarn workflow`, it will execute each stage in order as defined in your workflow file.'
    flag:
        commit: '[AI] The `yarn stage --commit` command is a part of Yarn''s built-in GitOps workflow feature called `workflow-runner`. It''s used to commit changes to your Git repository after the specified build, test, or other stages have been completed successfully. The `--commit` flag tells Yarn to automatically create a git commit message using the current branch''s HEAD message and commit the changes to the repository. This command is useful for continuous integration and delivery workflows where you want to automatically push changes after testing and building your project.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `yarn stage --dry-run` is a command used in Yarn, a popular JavaScript package manager. This command is part of Yarn''s workflow feature which allows you to define multiple stages for building and testing your application. The `--dry-run` flag is an optional argument that simulates the execution of a stage without actually making any changes or producing any output. In other words, it runs through each task in the defined stage and displays what would be done without actually executing the tasks. This can help you understand the flow of your build process, identify potential issues, and refine your workflow before running it for real.'
        reset: '[AI] `yarn stage --reset` is a command used in Yarn, a popular package manager for JavaScript projects. This command resets all the staged changes in the Git repository back to their last committed state for all files in the current directory. In other words, it unstages or uncommits all changes that were previously staged for committing. This can be useful when you want to discard staged changes and start over.'
