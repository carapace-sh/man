documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command `avdmanager create avd` is used in Android Studio or the Android SDK platform-tools to create a new Virtual Device (AVD) definition using the Android Virtual Device Manager. It requires specifying certain parameters such as the name of the device definition, the device definition file, and the target API level. For example, `avdmanager create avd My_Device_Definition -f mydevicedefinition.ini -c Nexus_5X_API_29` creates a new AVD named "My\_Device\_Definition" with a target API level of 29 based on the Nexus 5X device definition.'
    flag:
        abi: '[AI] `avdmanager create avd` is a command used in Android Studio or the Android Development Tools (ADT) to create a new Virtual Device (AVD) definition. The `--abi` option specifies the target Architecture and ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces) for the AVD. For example, `avdmanager create avd --name MyCustomDevice --abi x86_64` would create a new virtual device named "MyCustomDevice" with the x86\_64 architecture. This command downloads and installs the specified image from Google''s Platforms repository.'
        device: |-
            [AI] The `avdmanager create avd --device` command is used with the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager in Android Studio or the SDK Platform-Tools to create a new AVD with specific device definitions. The `--device` option specifies the name or ID of an existing device definition file, which can be obtained from the `devices.txt` file in the `$ANDROID_SDK/devices` directory or from Google's list of supported devices.

            For instance, if you want to create a new AVD based on the Nexus 5X device definition:

            ```bash
            avdmanager create avd --name "Nexus5X" --device Nexus_5X
            ```

            This command creates a new AVD with the name `Nexus5X` using the device definition file for the Nexus 5X. When you launch the emulator using this AVD, it will start with an image of the Android operating system corresponding to the specified device definition.
        force: '[AI] `avdmanager create avd --force` is a command used in Android Studio or the Android SDK Platform-Tools to create a new AVD (Android Virtual Device) with the specified configuration, using the `--force` option to override any existing device definition with that name. If an AVD with the same name already exists, it will be replaced without asking for confirmation. This command is used when you need to recreate or update an existing AVD with specific configurations.'
        name: '[AI] `avdmanager create avd` is a command used in Android Studio or the Android SDK Platform-Tools to create a new Android Virtual Device (AVD). The `--name` option is used to specify a descriptive name for the AVD being created. For example, `avdmanager create avd --name MyCustomAVD --definition file://path/to/avd/definition/file`. This command sets up an emulated Android device environment for testing and development purposes.'
        package: '[AI] `avdmanager create avd --package` is a command used with the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager in the Android Studio IDE or the Android SDK platform-tools. This command creates a new AVD profile using a specific Android package file as its base image. The package file represents a particular Android OS version and configuration, allowing you to create an AVD that matches your desired environment closely.'
        path: '[AI] `avdmanager` is a command-line tool for managing Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) using the Android SDK Platform-Tools. The command `avdmanager create avd --path <path>` creates a new AVD with the given name and sets its file location to the specified path. For example, `avdmanager create my_new_avd --path /path/to/my_avd`. This command does not install or configure any specific Android platform or system image for the new AVD; it only creates an empty framework with the given name and sets its file location.'
        sdcard: |-
            [AI] The command `avdmanager create avd --sdcard` is used with the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager in the Android Studio IDE or the command line tool for creating a new AVD with a specified SD card image file. Here's a brief explanation of the components:

            - `avdmanager`: This is the Android Virtual Device Manager, a command-line tool that manages creation and deletion of AVDs.
            - `create avd`: This command creates a new AVD with specified configurations.
            - `--sdcard`: This option specifies the path to an SD card image file to be used for the new AVD. The SD card image can be provided as a file or a URL. If not specified, no SD card will be created for the AVD.
        snapshot: '[AI] `avdmanager create avd --snapshot` is a command used in Android Studio or the Android SDK platform-tools to create an AVD (Android Virtual Device) from a saved snapshot of an existing virtual device configuration. This command restores the previous state of the virtual device, including its system image, configuration settings, and data. It''s useful when you want to revert back to a specific state or configuration for testing purposes.'
        tag: '[AI] The `avdmanager create avd` command is used in Android Studio to create a new Virtual Device (AVD) definition using the Android Virtual Device Manager (avdmanager). The `--tag` option is used to specify a descriptive name or label for the newly created AVD. For example, `avdmanager create avd --name MyCustomDevice --tag mycustomtag`. This command generates an XML file in the .android/avd directory with the specified name and tag, defining the device configuration such as CPU type, screen size, API level, etc. The tag is a user-defined identifier that can be used to easily identify and manage the AVD later.'
