    command: '[AI] `tsh proxy azure` is a command used in Tsung, an open-source load testing tool.

        app: '[AI] The `tsh proxy azure --app` command is a part of Traffic Server (tsh) from Apache, which is used to configure and manage Azure Traffic Manager profiles. This specific command sets up a new frontend application within an existing Azure Traffic Manager profile using the Traffic Router component as the backend pool.

        format: |-
            [AI] `tsh proxy azure` is a command from the Azure CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool, specifically the Tsql (Transportable SQL) extension. The `--format` option in this command specifies how the output of the operation should be formatted.

            For instance, when using `tsh proxy azure sql <query> --format=table`, it returns the query results as a tabular format. Alternatively, when using `tsh proxy azure sql <query> --format=tsv`, it returns the query results as TSV (Tab-Separated Values) format.

            The flag `--format` is used to customize the output representation based on your preference or further processing requirements.
        port: '[AI] The `tsh proxy azure --port` command is a part of the Tsung loading testing tool, specifically its Azure module. This command sets up a Tsung proxy on Microsoft Azure. The `--port` option specifies the port number that will be used for communication between the Tsung controller and the generated load. In other words, it configures the proxy to listen on the specified port for incoming test traffic.'
