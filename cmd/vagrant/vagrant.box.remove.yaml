documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant box remove` command is used to delete a specific Vagrant box from your local machine. When you run this command with the name or ID of the box as an argument, Vagrant will search for and remove the associated box files in the .vagrant.d/boxes directory. This action removes the box from your local Vagrant environment, preventing it from being used in future projects unless you re-download or reinstall it.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `vagrant box remove --all` is a Vagrant command used to delete all installed boxes from your local Vagrant environment. When you run this command, it removes every box under the `.vagrant/boxes` directory in your current working directory or global Vagrant configuration. This action may be irreversible as it deletes the actual files, not just their metadata. It is typically used when you want to start fresh with a clean slate and remove all previously installed boxes.'
        box-version: '[AI] The `vagrant box remove --box-version` command is used to remove a specific version of a Vagrant box from your local system. Vagrant boxes are pre-packaged environments that include the operating system, application servers, and configurations needed to quickly set up a development environment. By specifying the name of the box and its version number, this command will delete the specified box version from your local Vagrant directory, allowing you to manage and keep track of different versions if desired.'
        force: '[AI] `vagrant box remove --force` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command removes a specified Vagrant box from your local directory, ignoring any error messages that may occur due to the box being currently in use by another Vagrant project or having dependent boxes that cannot be removed. The `--force` option is used to override these warnings and remove the box forcefully. It''s essential to ensure that removing a box won''t negatively impact your projects before executing this command.'
        provider: '[AI] The `vagrant box remove` command is used to delete a specific Vagrant box from your local machine. The `--provider` option specifies which cloud provider or package registry, such as Hashicorp Atlas, VirtualBox, or Docker, the box was downloaded from. By using this option, you can remove the box from the specified provider''s account and also locally on your machine. This command does not affect running Vagrant environments or configurations that rely on the box, it just removes the box definition.'
