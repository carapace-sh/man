    command: '[AI] The `minikube addons open` command is used to interact with the Addon Manager UI in Minikube, an tool for running Kubernetes locally. This command opens your default web browser and directs it to the Minikube Addons page where you can enable or disable various addons that extend the functionality of your local Kubernetes cluster.'
    flag:
        https: |-
            [AI] The command `minikube addons enable --extra-config=addon-name.http.enabled=true` enables an additional configuration for a specific Minikube addon related to HTTP over SSL/TLS communication. The `--https` flag is not part of the standard Minikube addons command, but it seems you may have combined it with the correct command unintentionally.

            To clarify:
            - `minikube addons enable` enables an addon (replace "addon-name" with the name of your desired addon)
            - `--extra-config` is used to pass extra configuration options to the addon, and in this case we're setting the "http.enabled" option to true to allow HTTPS communication.
        interval: |-
            [AI] The `minikube addons enable` command is used to enable specific addons in Minikube, a tool for running Kubernetes locally. The `open --interval` argument is an option that can be passed with this command.

            The `--interval` flag sets the time interval (in seconds) between automatic retries when enabling or disabling addons. For instance, if you specify `--interval=30s`, Minikube will wait for 30 seconds before retrying to enable or disable an addon if it fails initially. The `open` argument, on the other hand, is used with certain addons that provide a web interface, such as the `Dashboard` and `StorageClass` addons, and enables them automatically when run.

            So, the command `minikube addons enable dashboard StorageClass --interval=30s open` would enable both the Dashboard and StorageClass addons in Minikube, waiting 30 seconds between each attempt if they fail to enable initially.
        url: '[AI] The `minikube addons open --url` command is used to open the Marketplace page of Minikube Addons in your web browser. Minikube Addons is a repository of extensions that can be installed into a Minikube cluster to extend its functionality. By running this command, you''ll be provided with a URL which, when opened in a web browser, will display the available addons that can be installed into your Minikube cluster.'
        wait: '[AI] `minikube addons enable` is a command used in Minikube, a tool for running Kubernetes locally. This command is used to enable an addon in the Minikube cluster. The `--wait` flag that follows it, `minikube addons enable --wait`, instructs Minikube to wait until the addon is fully installed and ready before continuing with further processes. This ensures that the addon is properly configured and functioning before moving on to other tasks.'
