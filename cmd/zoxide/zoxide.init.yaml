documentation:
    command: '[AI] `zoxide init` is a command used to initialize the use of Zoxide, a fast and fuzzy file finder for the terminal. It creates or updates the necessary configuration files in your home directory, allowing you to use Zoxide''s features like instant file preview and fuzzy searching across your file system.'
    flag:
        cmd: '[AI] `zoxide init --cmd` is a command used in the Zsh terminal shell to configure Zoxide, a fuzzy file finder, with an initializer script or function. The `--cmd` flag specifies that the following argument should be treated as a command to execute within the initialized environment. This allows you to set up custom behaviors, such as binding keys or modifying other settings, when Zoxide is initialized. For instance, if you have a script called `my-zoxide-setup.sh` containing desired configurations, use `zoxide init --cmd ''source my-zoxide-setup.sh''` to apply the setup upon initialization.'

            [AI] `zoxide init` is a command used to install Zoxide, a filesystem-aware fuzzy finder for zsh. The `--help` option provides detailed information about how to use this command correctly. Here's a brief summary:

            `zoxide init [--vcs VCS] [--git-dir DIRECTORY] [--install-hook HOOK] [--no-global]`

            - `[--vcs VCS]`: Specify the version control system you use, such as Git (default) or Mercurial.
            - `[--git-dir DIRECTORY]`: Manually set the path to your git directory if it's not in the default location.
            - `[--install-hook HOOK]`: Install a custom hook script before Zoxide is configured.
            - `[--no-global]`: Don't install Zoxide globally (only for development).

            This command configures your shell environment to work with Zoxide, which offers various improvements over the standard zsh fuzzy finder, like filesystem awareness and VCS integration.
        hook: '[AI] `zoxide init --hook` is a command used with the Zsh package manager, zoxide. This command sets up a new file or modifies an existing one as a zoxide hook. Hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain events occur within zoxide, such as navigating directories or creating new projects. The `--hook` flag specifies the type of hook to be created or modified.'
        no-cmd: '[AI] The `zoxide init --no-cmd` command is used to install Zoxide, a fuzzy finder for the terminal, without adding any default integration with other editors or shells. This means that after installation, Zoxide will not automatically set up any editor commands or modify your shell configuration file. If you wish to use Zoxide with a specific editor or shell, you will need to configure it manually.'
        version: '[AI] `zoxide init --version` is a command used with Zoxide, a fuzzy finder and file explorer for zsh. This specific command is used to check and print the version number of the Zoxide package installed in your system. It helps users ensure they have the latest version or troubleshoot any potential issues by comparing the version they are using against the latest available.'
