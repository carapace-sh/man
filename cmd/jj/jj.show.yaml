documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `jj show` command is a part of the Jupyter Notebook Interactive Python REPL (REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print Loop), which is an alternative way to run Python code in Jupyter Notebook cells. This command is used to display the help or documentation for a specific Python module, function, class, or other object. When you type `jj show` followed by the name of what you want to see the documentation for (for example, `jj show numpy`), Jupyter will search for and display the corresponding documentation using an external documentation source like IPython''s `ipywidgets`, `ipydoc`, or `numpydoc`.'
    flag:
        color-words: '[AI] The `--color-words` option in the `jj` command is used to enable colored output for certain words or phrases during the search and replace process. This can make it easier to identify specific matches within large files or output streams. For instance, when performing a substitution operation, you can highlight errors, keys, or other significant parts of the text with distinct colors for better readability. It''s important to note that this option is typically used with terminal applications that support color displays.'
        git: '[AI] The `jj show --git` command is used in Jira, a project management tool by Atlassian. It is not a standard Linux or Git command. This command is employed to display Git repository details of a specific Jira issue. When you run this command, Jira will fetch and present the associated Git repository URL, branch name, and commit message for the issue in question.'
        help: '[AI] The command `jj show --help` is used with Jira JIRA CLI tool (Java-based) for managing and interacting with Jira projects programmatically. This specific command displays a help message detailing the options and usage of the ''show'' subcommand. It provides information on which project key, issue ID or JQL query should be used to fetch the data, as well as available output formats.'
        stat: '[AI] The `jj show --stat` command is used in Jupyter Notebook to display detailed statistics about the execution time and memory usage of individual cells or all cells in a notebook. The `--stat` option enables the output of statistics, and the `show` command is used to display the results. It provides information such as the total time elapsed, CPU and IOP usage, and maximum memory consumption for each cell, allowing users to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize their code accordingly.'
        summary: '[AI] `jj show --summary` is a command in Jupyter Journal''s (jj) CLI for displaying a summary of the available notebooks in a specific directory or project. It provides brief information about each notebook, including its name, last modified date, and status (e.g., saved or unsaved). This command can help users quickly identify and manage their Jupyter Notebooks.'
        tool: '[AI] The `jj show --tool` command is a part of JJ (Just Java), an open-source Java development tool. It''s used to display the details of a specific Java tool or plugin installed in your JJ environment. This includes the name, version, and other relevant metadata about the tool.'
        types: '[AI] The `jj show --types` command is used in Jupyter Jupyter''s text-based interface (jj) to display available cell types supported by Jupyter Notebooks. These include code cells for executing code, markdown cells for formatting text and adding media, and raw cells for inserting arbitrary data without interpretation. The output will list the different cell types with their corresponding mime types.'
