description: Push a plugin to a registry
flags:
    --disable-content-trust: Skip image signing
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker plugin push` command is used to upload a Docker plugin, which is an extension that adds functionality to the Docker Engine, to a registry or repository. This command takes as argument the name of the plugin image and the registry URL with optional authentication details. For instance, `docker plugin push myplugin:latest <registry-url>[:<port>/<username>:<password>]`. The plugin must be built locally beforehand using `docker build` or other means, and the resulting image should be tagged with a name that matches the desired registry format. This command is typically used when developing plugins to make them available for others to use in their Docker environments.'
    flag:
        disable-content-trust: '[AI] The `docker plugin push --disable-content-trust` command is used to publish a Docker plugin without signing it with a notary server or using content trust. Content trust ensures the authenticity and integrity of the plugin by digitally signing it before pushing it to a registry. By disabling this feature, you can still push your plugin to a registry, but without the added security measures provided by content trust. This may be useful in development environments where quick publishing is prioritized over secure distribution.'
