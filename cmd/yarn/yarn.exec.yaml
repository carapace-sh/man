        [AI] `yarn exec` is a command used in Yarn, a popular JavaScript package manager. It allows running an executable script or a binary located outside of your project's dependencies with ease. The basic usage is:

        ```bash
        yarn exec <command>
        ```

        Replace `<command>` with the name of the command you want to run, such as an npm script, a binary tool, or any other executable. The command and its dependencies will be installed from your Yarn lockfile if needed, ensuring consistent execution across environments.
