documentation:
    command: '[AI] `newrelic diagnose run` is a command used in New Relic''s software performance monitoring tool to initiate an diagnostic scan on one or more applications or hosts monitored by New Relic. The command gathers and analyzes performance data, identifies issues, and provides recommendations for improvement. It checks various aspects such as application code, infrastructure, and configurations. The results are then displayed in the New Relic UI.'
    flag:
        attachment-key: '[AI] The `newrelic diagnose run --attachment-key` command is used in New Relic, a performance monitoring tool, to initiate a diagnostic scan for a specific application or infrastructure issue. The `--attachment-key` option specifies a unique identifier of an attachment (a file or log data) that will be included as part of the diagnostics package sent to New Relic for analysis. This helps New Relic support engineers analyze complex issues more effectively and accurately.'
        list-suites: |-
            [AI] `newrelic diagnose run --list-suites` is a command used in New Relic, a software performance monitoring tool. This command lists available diagnostic suites, which are predefined collections of tests that New Relic uses to diagnose specific issues in applications or infrastructure.

            When you run this command, New Relic returns a list of diagnostic suite names and their descriptions, helping users understand what each suite checks and identifies related to their monitored environments. The returned information assists users in selecting the most appropriate diagnostic suite for their issue investigation.
        suites: |-
            [AI] The `newrelic diagnose run --suites` command is a feature of New Relic, a software performance monitoring tool. This specific command is used to initiate a diagnostic scan with predefined sets of checks called "suites."

            Each suite focuses on specific aspects of application performance or infrastructure health, such as web application, database, browser, and network issues. When executed, the command scans your monitored resources and generates reports based on the results of the chosen suites. These reports provide insights and recommendations to help identify and resolve performance bottlenecks or other issues impacting your applications or services.
        verbose: '[AI] The `newrelic diagnose run --verbose` command is a part of New Relic''s Diagnostic Tool, which is used to help identify and resolve performance issues with applications monitored by New Relic. When this command is executed with the `--verbose` flag, it produces detailed output that includes information about the diagnostics being run and their results. This can be useful for debugging purposes or for gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying performance issues. Essentially, the `--verbose` flag increases the amount and detail of output produced by the diagnostic tool, making it more informative for troubleshooting.'
