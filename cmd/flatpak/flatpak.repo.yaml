documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flatpak repo` is a command-line utility for managing Flatpak repositories. It allows users to add, remove, and list available Flatpak repositories. Flatpak is a packaging system for Linux distributions that enables the deployment of applications in sandboxed environments. Repositories are collections of applications packaged using the Flatpak format, which can be easily installed and updated using this command.'
    flag:
        branches: '[AI] `flatpak repo --branches` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to list all available branches for a given repository. Branches represent different versions or builds of software packages that are available in the repository. By running this command, you can identify which branches exist and choose the appropriate one for installation based on your requirements, such as stability or features.'
        commits: '[AI] `flatpak repo --commits` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager to list the commits for a specific repository. This command displays information about each commit, such as its SHA-1 checksum, author, date, and message. It can be useful for verifying the integrity of repository data or tracking changes to the repository over time.'
        help: '[AI] `flatpak repo --help` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to display help information about the repository-related subcommands. It allows users to manage and configure Flatpak repositories, which are collections of available packages that can be installed using Flatpak. The specific options and usage depend on the subcommand being used with `--help`. For example, `flatpak repo add --help` would display help information for adding new repositories, while `flatpak repo list --help` would show how to list existing repositories. Overall, this command is an essential tool for anyone using Flatpak to manage software packages on their system.'
        info: '[AI] `flatpak repo --info` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment platform. This command provides information about a Flatpak repository, including its name, URL, and the number of packages it contains, as well as other metadata such as its GPG key and sigging status. It helps users to manage and identify repositories for installing and updating applications packaged in Flatpak format.'
        metadata: '[AI] `flatpak repo --metadata` is a command used in Flatpak, a popular application packaging and deployment system. This command is used to query metadata about repositories, which are collections of applications packaged using the Flatpak format. The output provides details such as repository name, URL, and the available branches or checksums for each version of installed applications. It helps in managing and verifying the authenticity of software packages in a Flatpak-based system.'
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] The `flatpak repo --ostree-verbose` command is used to interact with the Flatpak OSTree repository, which is a component of Flatpak''s package management system. The `--ostree-verbose` flag increases the level of output detail when performing repository operations. When you run this command without any other arguments, it will list out all the available branches or commits in the repository, along with their corresponding hashes and commit messages. It is useful for debugging and for keeping track of the latest changes to the repository.'
        subset: '[AI] The `flatpak repo --subset` command is used to filter a Flatpak repository and only download the specified branches or tags of applications instead of the entire repository. This can save bandwidth and time by only installing specific versions of applications. For example, `flatpak repo --erset <repository> <branch|tag>` will only download applications from the specified repository with the given branch or tag. Multiple branches or tags can be listed separated by spaces.'
        subsets: '[AI] `flatpak repo --subsets` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager to list the available repository subsets. A subset is a collection of repositories that can be enabled or disabled together as a single unit, allowing fine-grained control over which sources are used to install or update Flatpak applications. This command helps system administrators and power users in managing their Flatpak repositories by showing them the list of available repository subsets and their current status.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak repo --verbose` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system. This command lists all the currently available remote repositories, displaying detailed information about each one in a verbose format. It helps developers and administrators to easily identify and manage the different sources of software packages.'
