description: Create a service using a specified subcommand
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubectl create service` is a command used to create a Kubernetes Service resource in a cluster. A Service exposes an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. It provides a stable IP address and DNS name for the application, allowing other components in the cluster to communicate with it using standard DNS or IP resolution mechanisms. The command takes various options such as the service type (e.g., ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer), target port, and selector labels to define the scope of the Service.'
