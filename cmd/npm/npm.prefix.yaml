    command: '[AI] The `npm prefix` command is used to configure the npm package manager to install global packages under a specific prefix directory. By default, npm installs global packages in `~/.npm-global` on Unix systems and `%APPDATA%\npm` on Windows. Running `npm prefix <path>` sets the global package installation path to the specified directory. This can be useful for organizations or users who want to keep their global packages separate from the default directories.'
    flag:
        global: '[AI] The `npm prefix --global` command is a function of Node Package Manager (npm), which is a popular package manager for JavaScript projects. When used, it sets the installation prefix for global packages to `C:\Program Files\npm\node_modules` on Windows or `/usr/local/lib/node_modules` on Unix-based systems. This command enables the installation of npm packages globally, meaning they become available to all projects and Node.js instances across the system, rather than being limited to a single project''s local installation.'
