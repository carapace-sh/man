    command: '[AI] `flatpak kill` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager for Linux systems. It forcefully terminates a running application that was installed using Flatpak. The command requires specification of the application''s ID or bundle name, which can be provided as an argument after the command: `flatpak kill <APP_ID>`. When executed, it sends a SIGTERM signal to the process and waits for a grace period before sending a SIGKILL signal if the application does not terminate.'

        help: |-
            [AI] `flatpak kill` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. This command is used to terminate running applications or services packed as Flatpaks. The `--help` option provides detailed usage information when invoked:

            ```
            Usage: flatpak kill [OPTIONS] [ID|PATH...]

            Terminate running applications or daemons managed by Flatpak.

            Options:
              --all                 Terminate all applications and background services.
              --running             Only terminate running applications.
              --idle                 Only terminate idle applications (not responding to events).
              --quiet               Do not print application names when killing.
              --help                Show this help message and exit.
            ```

            This command can be used with various options like `--all`, `--running`, or `--idle` to selectively terminate applications based on their status. The `ID` or `PATH` argument identifies the specific application or background service to be killed.
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak kill` is a command used to stop a running Flatpak application. The `--ostree-verbose` option increases the verbosity of output when interacting with OSTree, which is the version control system that Flatpak uses for managing filesystem snapshots. When you use `flatpak kill --ostree-verbose`, it provides detailed information about the snapshot being used by the application and the steps taken to stop it. This can be helpful for debugging purposes or for gaining a better understanding of how Flatpak manages applications at the system level.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak kill --verbose` is a command used in the Flatpak software deployment platform to forcibly terminate a running Flatpak application or service. The `--verbose` option increases the level of output, providing detailed information about the process being killed, including its PID (Process ID), name, and other relevant details.'
