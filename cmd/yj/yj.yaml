documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "yj" does not exist in standard Unix or Linux shells, such as Bash or Zsh. It may be a typo or a command specific to a particular software or configuration. If you meant to use another command, please check the documentation for that command instead.'
    flag:
        e: '[AI] The `yj` command with the flag `-e` is a part of the `yajl-tools` package in Unix-like operating systems. This flag stands for "json-mode editing" and is used to interactively edit JSON data using the `jq` language-agnostic command-line JSON processor that comes with `yajl-tools`. Essentially, it allows users to modify JSON data in real-time by providing a convenient and powerful command-line interface.'
        h: '[AI] The `yj` command is a popular text manipulation tool, similar to `sed` and `awk`. The option `-h` or `--help` is used to display the usage information for the given command. Therefore, when you run `yj -h`, it will show you the detailed help documentation of the `yj` command, including its usage syntax, available options, and examples.'
        i: '[AI] The `yj` command with the option `-i` is a part of the `yajl-utils` package in Linux and UNIX systems. It''s used for handling JSON data. The `-i` flag stands for "interactive" mode, which enables reading input interactively from standard input (keyboard), instead of from a file, allowing users to input multiple JSON documents one by one for processing.'
        k: '[AI] The command `yj -k` is using a tool called `yajl-json-py`, which is a Python JSON processor modeled after YAML''s `yaml json` in terms of both API and performance characteristics. The `-k` flag stands for "keep keys as-is", meaning that it will preserve the original keys in the output JSON, instead of converting them to CamelCase or snake_case, which is the default behavior without this flag.'
        "n": '[AI] The `yj` command is a popular alias for the `yaml-joint` or `jq` tool in YAML processing, which allows chaining multiple JSON or YAML filters together in a piped workflow. The `-n` flag stands for "no emit," which instructs `jq` or `yaml-joint` not to output any data by default, but only produce the exit status indicating success or failure based on the filters applied. This is useful when you want to use these tools in scripts or conditional statements where their output isn''t needed directly.'
        v: '[AI] The `yj` command with the `-v` flag is a part of the `yq` YAML processor by-coreutils. This flag stands for "version" and is used to print out the version information of the `yq` tool. When you run `yj -v`, it will display the version number, commit SHA, and other build details associated with the specific `yq` installation being used.'
