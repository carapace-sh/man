        comment: '[AI] `gh pr close --comment` is a command used in GitHub''s `git-hub` (`gh`) CLI tool. It closes an open Pull Request by providing a comment. The `--comment` option allows you to include a message or explanation for the closure. Without it, the pull request would be closed without leaving any feedback.'
        delete-branch: '[AI] `gh pr close --delete-branch` is a GitHub command used to close a Pull Request (PR) and delete its associated branch in one step, when you''re sure that the changes have been merged into the target branch. This command helps maintain a clean repository by removing unused branches and ensures that all changes are correctly integrated into the main project. It saves time and effort compared to closing the PR manually then deleting the branch separately.'
