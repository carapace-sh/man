        [AI] `nmcli connection import` is a command used in NetworkManager, a system service for managing network connections in Linux systems. This command allows you to import a networking configuration file into NetworkManager's database of available connections. The syntax is as follows:

        ```bash
        nmcli connection import <file> [connection-name]
        ```

        Here, `<file>` refers to the path to the networking configuration file, which can be in various formats like `.conn`, `.networkdb` or `.xml`. The optional `connection-name` argument is used to specify a custom name for the new connection, otherwise NetworkManager will assign an automatic name based on the file contents. This command imports the settings from the file into the system's network connections and makes them available for usage with other NetworkManager commands or GUI tools.
    flag:
        temporary: '[AI] `nmcli connection import --temporary` is a command used in NetworkManager (nmcli) to import a new network connection configuration file with a temporary profile. This means the connection will not be saved permanently after the system reboot, but only persist during the current session. It''s useful for quickly configuring ad-hoc networks or testing new configurations without affecting the persistent connections.'
