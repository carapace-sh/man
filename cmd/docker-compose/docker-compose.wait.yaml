name: wait SERVICE [SERVICE...] [OPTIONS]
description: Block until the first service container stops
flags:
    --down-project: Drops project when the first container stops
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker-compose wait` is a command used with Docker Compose to monitor and wait for one or more services to be fully up and running before printing a message or continuing execution in the terminal. It keeps checking the status of specified services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file until they are all ready, at which point it exits with a zero exit code. This is useful when working with multi-container applications where some services may take longer to start than others.'
    flag:
        down-project: '[AI] `docker-compose wait` is a command used with Docker Compose files to monitor and wait for one or more services to be up and running before printing a message or continuing execution. The `--down-project` flag is an optional argument that instructs `docker-compose wait` to also stop and remove containers, networks, and volumes when any service in the project fails. This can help ensure that the environment is cleaned up properly when an error occurs.'
