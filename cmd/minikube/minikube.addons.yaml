    command: '[AI] `minikube addons` is a command used in Minikube, a tool for running Kubernetes locally. It manages installed addons, which are extensions that provide additional functionality to Minikube such as enabling ingress, enabling Docker, or using a specific driver for the hypervisor. You can use `minikube addons list` to view installed addons, `minikube addons enable <addon-name>` to install a new addon, and `minikube addons disable <addon-name>` to remove an existing one.'
