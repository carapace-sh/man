documentation:
    command: '[AI] "dagger run" is a command used in Dagger, a build and dependency management tool for GitHubActions and other CI/CD systems. It executes a defined Dagger task or build file directly without triggering a full pipeline run. This can be useful when testing changes locally or when you only need to build a specific component or artifact without going through the entire workflow.'
    flag:
        cleanup-timeout: '[AI] The `--cleanup-timeout` flag in the `dagger run` command is used to specify a time limit for Dagger, an open-source continuous integration and delivery tool, to clean up intermediate artifacts generated during a build or deployment process. If the cleanup process takes longer than the specified timeout, Dagger will terminate it forcefully to prevent resource contention or unnecessary delays in the CI/CD pipeline. This flag helps maintain efficient use of resources and keeps the build environment clean.'
        focus: '[AI] The `dagger run --focus` command is used in Dagger, a Kubernetes application deployment tool. It instructs Dagger to prioritize and apply only the changes that directly affect the specified resource or application, without triggering a full sync or redeployment of other unrelated resources. This can save time and resources when making targeted updates or fixes.'
