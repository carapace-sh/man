documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea milestones list` command is used in the TeamEngine Agile planning tool to display a list of all defined milestones for a specific project. Milestones are significant points in a project''s timeline representing important deliverables or deadlines. This command helps users keep track of project progress by providing an overview of these key checkpoints.'
    flag:
        fields: '[AI] The `tea milestones list --fields` command is used in the Jira or Confluence software by Atlassian to retrieve a list of tea project milestones with specified fields. Tea stands for "Test Management for JIRA," a toolset used for managing test cases and test cycles. The `--fields` option specifies which fields should be returned in the response, such as ID, name, startDate, endDate, or any custom fields associated with the milestones.'
        limit: '[AI] The `tea milestones list --limit` command is used in Jenkins''s Temporal Engineering Analytics (TEA) plugin for managing and querying Continuous Integration (CI) data. This command retrieves a list of milestones (significant events, like successful builds or failed tests) within a specified limit. The `--limit` option sets the maximum number of milestones to be displayed in the output. For instance, `tea milestones list --limit 10` would return the last ten milestones that occurred in your Jenkins project.'
        login: '[AI] `tea milestones list --login` is a command used in the Jenkins Continuous Integration tool. This command generates a list of all defined milestones within a Jenkins project, which are usually associated with specific releases or development stages. The `--login` flag is included to specify that the command should be executed using an existing Jenkins user''s credentials for authentication, providing secure access to the Jenkins instance.'
        output: '[AI] `tea milestones list --output` is a command used in TestComplete, a software testing tool by SmartBear. This command generates a report of all defined milestones (predefined points in the test development process) for a Test Run or a Project. The `--output` option specifies that the report should be output as plain text or an XML file instead of the default GUI view.'
        page: '[AI] The `tea milestones list --page` command is used in Jenkins, a continuous integration and delivery tool, to view the details of a specific page of Milestones in the Jenkins pipeline. Milestones are user-defined markers in a Jenkins pipeline that represent important stages or checkpoints in a project. By specifying the `--page` option followed by a number, this command will display the milestones list starting from that page.'
        remote: '[AI] The `tea milestones list --remote` command is used in the TEA (TeamEngine Accelerate) tool, which is a part of the GitLab DevOps platform. This command retrieves the list of milestones from a remote GitLab project. It allows users to view the milestones defined by the team in the specified project and plan their work accordingly.'
        repo: '[AI] The `tea milestones list --repo` command is used in the Jenkins Continuous Integration (CI) tool with the TEA (Test, Execute, Analyze) plugin. It retrieves a list of milestones for a specific Git repository under Jenkins management. Milestones represent groups of related tasks or issues, and help teams plan, track, and manage their development progress. The command returns details such as milestone names, IDs, and due dates in JSON format that can be further processed by scripts or other tools.'
        state: '[AI] The `tea milestones list --state` command is a part of the Jenkins Continuous Integration (CI) tool''s `Tea` plugin for managing test automation jobs. This command generates a list of current milestone states for all tests defined in the system. A milestone represents a set of related tests or a testing phase in your project, and its state can be "passed", "failed", or "skipped". This information is useful to understand the current status and progress of your testing efforts within Jenkins.'
