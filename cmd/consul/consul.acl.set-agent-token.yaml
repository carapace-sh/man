documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul acl set-agent-token` command is used to set or update an agent token in Hashicorp''s Consul service, which is part of its Access and Security (ACL) feature. This command allows you to grant specific permissions to Consul agents based on the provided token. When used, it requires the token value as an argument to be passed. The new token can be used to configure an agent''s behavior within a Consul cluster according to defined ACL policies.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] The `consul acl set-agent-token --ca-file` command is used to set the token for an Consul agent with Access Control List (ACL) permissions. The `--ca-file` option specifies the path to a file containing the CA (Certificate Authority) certificates that Consul will use to verify the client''s certificate during the token granting process. This command is typically used in a secure environment where Consul agents communicate over TLS and access control is enforced using tokens and certificates.'
        ca-path: '[AI] The `consul acl set-agent-token --ca-path` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command sets the token for an agent joining the Consul cluster with Access Control List (ACL) enabled. The `--ca-path` option specifies the path to the CA (Certifying Authority) certificate file used to sign the tokens. The CA is necessary to ensure secure communication between agents and the Consul server, and to enforce access control policies in a multi-tenant environment.'
        client-cert: '[AI] The `consul acl set-agent-token --client-cert` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command sets the token for an agent using a client certificate. In other words, it assigns a security token to an agent (a node running a Consul agent) based on the provided client certificate. The certificate acts as identification for the agent to interact with the Consul ACL policy in a secure manner.'
        client-key: '[AI] The `consul acl set-agent-token --client-key` command is used in the Consul configuration management tool to set an ACL (Access Control List) token for a Consul agent, using the provided client key. Consul is a connectivity and orchestration tool for service-oriented architectures and multi-data center applications. The ACL system allows administrators to define access policies that control which services, keys, and other resources are accessible to different agents or clients. By setting an agent token with `set-agent-token`, the Consul agent will be granted specific permissions defined in the ACL policy associated with the token.'
        datacenter: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl set-agent-token --datacenter` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command sets the datacenter for an agent token in the Consul Access Control List (ACL) system.

            When creating a new Consul agent or managing existing ones, it's important to assign the appropriate datacenter to ensure proper communication and alignment with other agents within your Consul cluster. The `--datacenter` flag specifies the name of the datacenter for the given token. This command sets the specified token within the ACL system, enabling or restricting access based on the configured policies.
        http-addr: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl set-agent-token --http-addr` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source distributed computing platform, to set the HTTP address for an agent token in Access Control List (ACL) mode.

            When Consul runs in ACL mode, access control policies can be enforced between different parts of the Consul system. An agent token is a unique identifier that grants permissions to an individual Consul agent. By setting the agent token with a specific HTTP address using this command, you're granting that particular agent access to the Consul service from that specified location.

            The command itself consists of two parts:

            1. `consul acl set-agent-token` - This is the name of the command used to manage and configure agent tokens in Consul ACL mode.
            2. `--http-addr <IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>` - This option sets the HTTP address for the agent token, which consists of an IP address and a port number separated by a colon (:). The IP address can be either an internal or external IP, and the port number should correspond to the Consul HTTP API listening port.

            In summary, this command is used to configure an agent token's access permissions in Consul ACL mode by setting its associated HTTP address.
        stale: '[AI] The `consul acl set-agent-token --stale` command is used in Consul, a Connectivity and Orchestration tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration of applications, to update an agent token with ACL permissions that are no longer considered current but still valid. This flag allows the updating of stale tokens without revoking them immediately. It can be useful when making gradual updates to Access Control Lists (ACLs) without disrupting ongoing operations. However, using stale tokens can pose a security risk if an agent''s token is compromised or its ACL permissions should no longer apply.'
        tls-server-name: '[AI] The `consul acl set-agent-token --tls-server-name` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration management, and orchestration. This command sets a new token for an agent joining the Consul cluster with Access Control List (ACL) enabled, using TLS for secure communication. The `--tls-server-name` option specifies the name of the TLS server to authenticate against during the connection.'
        token: '[AI] The `consul acl set-agent-token --token` command is used in Consul, an open-source distributed, yet simple and flexible hierarchical Key-Value store and service registration system. It sets the token for an agent in the Access Control List (ACL) of Consul. The `--token` option specifies the new token value to be set. By doing so, you can manage which agents have access to certain parts of your Consul configuration.'
        token-file: '[AI] The `consul acl set-agent-token --token-file` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command sets the token for a Consul agent using a file containing the token instead of providing it directly on the command line. The `--token-file` option specifies the path to the file that contains the token as its argument. This command helps secure the token by avoiding hardcoding it in scripts or configuration files, enhancing the security posture of Consul deployments.'
