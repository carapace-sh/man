documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker-compose alpha viz` command is a feature in Docker Compose (in Alpha stage) that generates visual representations of your multi-container Docker applications using Graphviz. This command reads the `docker-compose.yml` file and generates a graphical representation of the application''s architecture, showing how containers are connected by networks and dependencies. The resulting image can be saved as a .dot file (Graphviz format) for further processing or visualization using external tools like Graphviz Dot viewer or Graphviz web applications such as Gephi or yWorks.'
    flag:
        image: '[AI] The `docker-compose` `alpha viz --image` command is a feature of Docker Compose in its alpha stage, which provides an image analysis visualization tool. This command displays information about the images used in your Docker Compose file, including their size, tags, and history. It helps users to quickly identify potential image size issues, version inconsistencies, or other image-related concerns within their multi-container applications.'
        indentation-size: '[AI] `docker-compose` is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The `alpha viz` subcommand is an experimental feature that provides visualization capabilities. The option `--indentation-size` is used to specify the number of spaces (or tabs) in the indentation of the output YAML files when using the `compose file` or `docker-compose.yml` command for defining services and their configurations. By default, Docker Compose uses 2 spaces for indentation. You can override this by specifying a different number with the `--indentation-size` flag to better fit your preferred editor settings or team conventions.'
        networks: '[AI] The `docker-compose` `alpha viz --networks` command is a feature in Docker Compose''s alpha release, which is used to visualize and understand the networking configuration of a multi-container Docker application defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. The output of this command will display a graphical representation of how containers are connected through various network interfaces and services, such as user-defined networks or built-in networks like bridge or overlay networks. This visualization helps users gain insights into the networking topology and troubleshoot potential connectivity issues within their Docker applications.'
        ports: '[AI] `docker-compose alpha viz --ports` is a command used with Docker Compose, a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The `viz` subcommand is short for "visualization," and this specific usage displays a network graph of the defined services along with the published container ports. The `--ports` option makes the visualization show only the ports information.'
        spaces: '[AI] `docker-compose alpha viz --spaces` is a command used with Docker Compose, a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The `viz` subcommand is part of the Compose plugin called "Docker Compose Visualization". This command generates visual representations of the Compose files, displaying networks, services, and containers in a graph format. The `--spaces` option shows spaces or environments defined within the Compose file. It''s useful for understanding the organizational structure and dependencies between different parts of complex applications.'
