documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `go work use` command is a part of the Go Modules system in Go programming language. It is used to download and manage dependencies defined in a Go module''s `go.mod` file. When you run this command, it checks your current `go.mod` file for missing or updated dependencies and downloads them from their respective sources. The main goal of using `go work use` is keeping your project up-to-date with the latest versions of its required packages.'
    flag:
        r: '[AI] The `go build` command is used to compile Go source files into executable programs. The `-r` flag, when used with `go build`, enables the production of a statically linked binary. This means that all required dependencies are embedded in the binary file itself, making it portable and self-contained. In summary, using the `go build -r` command compiles Go source files into a single, statically linked executable.'
