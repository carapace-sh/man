        [AI] `npm adduser` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager) to create or update an npm user account. It requires providing a username, email address, and password as arguments:

        ```bash
        npm adduser <username> <email> <password>
        ```

        Upon execution, the command creates a new .npmrc file in your home directory (~/.npmrc) with the provided authentication details for the specified user. If the user already exists, the command updates the existing information instead.
    flag:
        scope: '[AI] The `npm adduser --scope` command is used to create a new user or add an email address to an existing npm (Node Package Manager) user account. The `--scope` option specifies the scope of the user registration, which can be used for organization-wide npm registrations. When you register with a scope, npm creates a new organization in its registry and associates the user account with that organization. This allows packages published under that account to be automatically granted access control permissions based on the organization''s settings.'
