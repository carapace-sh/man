documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vagrant cloud publish` is a Vagrant command used to make a box (a pre-configured virtual machine) available for sharing on the Vagrant Cloud, a public repository of Vagrant boxes. It builds and packages the local box, authenticates with your Vagrant Cloud account, and then publishes the box with the specified name and version. This command requires an internet connection and valid Vagrant Cloud API credentials. Once published, others can easily download and use the shared box for their own projects.'
    flag:
        box-version: '[AI] `vagrant cloud publish --box-version` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command publishes a previously built Vagrant box to the Vagrant Cloud, which is a public registry for sharing and discovering Vagrant boxes. The `--box-version` option specifies the version number of the box to be published. Once published, other users can download and use the box with that version number in their own Vagrant projects.'
        checksum: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud publish --checksum` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments, to publish a box (a pre-configured virtual machine) to the Vagrant Cloud repository along with its checksum. A checksum is a unique digital fingerprint of a file that can be used to verify its integrity during download, ensuring that the file has not been tampered with or corrupted during transmission. This command facilitates trust and security in the distribution of Vagrant boxes by enabling users to easily verify the authenticity and accuracy of the box before using it.'
        checksum-type: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud publish --checksum-type` command is used when publishing a Vagrant box on Atlas, the Vagrant Cloud repository. This option specifies the checksum type to use for the published box files. Currently, supported checksum types are `''sha1''` and `''sha256''`. The default value is `sha1`, but using `sha256` provides stronger security by generating a longer and more complex checksum. Box consumers can verify the downloaded box file integrity by comparing its checksum against the one published on Atlas.'
        description: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud publish` command with the `--description` option is used to publish a Vagrant box to the Vagrant Cloud repository. The description argument provides a brief explanation or summary of what the box does. This helps other users understand the purpose and capabilities of the box when they are browsing or searching for boxes to use in their own projects.'
        direct-upload: '[AI] `vagrant cloud publish --direct-upload` is a Vagrant command used to push a local Vagrant box directly to Atlas, a repository service provided by Hashicorp for sharing and discovering Vagrant boxes. With `--direct-upload`, the box files are uploaded from the local machine without going through the public internet, making it faster and more secure. This command requires authentication with Atlas using a valid API token.'
        force: '[AI] `vagrant cloud publish --force` is a Vagrant command used to push a box (a pre-configured virtual machine image) to the Vagrant Cloud repository despite potential conflicts. When you run this command, Vagrant checks if there''s already an identical box in the repository with the same name and version. If so, it gives you a warning but allows you to proceed and overwrite the existing box with the new one using the `--force` flag. This can be useful when you mistakenly publish an older or incorrect version of your box and need to update it in the registry.'
        no-direct-upload: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud publish --no-direct-upload` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machines, to publish a box (a pre-prepared virtual machine environment) to the Vagrant Cloud repository without using direct upload. Instead, it uses other caches or remote servers to distribute the box files. This approach can be useful when experiencing connectivity issues with the Vagrant Cloud server or to reduce bandwidth usage by leveraging existing caches.'
        no-force: '[AI] `vagrant cloud publish --no-force` is a Vagrant command used to push a box (preconfigured virtual machine image) to Vagrant Cloud (a public registry for sharing and discovering Vagrant boxes). The `--no-force` flag is optional, but it prevents the publication of a new version if the box already exists with the same name and version number in the repository. This can help maintain box consistency and avoid unintended overwrites.'
        no-private: '[AI] `vagrant cloud publish --no-private` is a Vagrant command used to share and make available a previously built Vagrant box on Vagrant Cloud (a public registry for Vagrant boxes maintained by Hashicorp). The `--no-private` option indicates that the publication should be made publicly accessible, meaning anyone can download and use the box without requiring authentication. If you want to keep your box private, you would not include this flag.'
        no-release: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud publish --no-release` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machines, to push a new box version to the Vagrant Cloud repository without creating a new release. When you build a new box version using Vagrant, by default, it will be automatically released to the public repository with a new version number. However, `--no-release` option disables this automatic release process, allowing you to manually manage your box versions and releases in the repository. This command is useful when you want to keep a private or internal box under development without making it publicly available until it''s ready for release.'
        private: '[AI] `vagrant cloud publish --private` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command is used to publish a box (a pre-configured virtual machine) to a private Vagrant Cloud repository. The "--private" option indicates that the box should only be accessible by authenticated users with proper permissions. By publishing to a private repository, you can securely share your custom boxes within your organization.'
        release: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud publish --release` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command publishes a previously created Vagrant box to the Vagrant Cloud repository with a specific release tag. When you create or update a Vagrant box, you can make it publicly available by publishing it to the Vagrant Cloud. The `--release` option allows you to publish under a specific release tag, making it easier for users to identify and use the desired version of your box.'
        short-description: '[AI] `vagrant cloud publish --short-description` is a Vagrant command used to publish a box to the Vagrant Cloud repository. The `--short-description` option sets the brief summary or tagline for the box in the repository. It helps users understand the purpose and key features of the box at a glance.'
        url: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud publish --url` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments, to publish a box (a pre-configured virtual machine image) to the Vagrant Cloud repository. The URL argument specifies the target URL of the repository where the box will be published. Once published, other users can easily discover and use the box by searching or browsing the Vagrant Cloud website.'
        version-description: '[AI] `vagrant cloud publish --version-description` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command publishes a specified version of a Vagrant box to the Vagrant Cloud repository with a given version description. The version description is a string that provides information about the contents or changes made in the published box version. It helps users understand what''s new or different when they decide to use this version.'
