documentation:
    command: '[AI] `waypoint artifact list-builds` is a Waypoint CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to list the available build artifacts for an image or Kubernetes resource in Waypoint. This command allows users to view details about each build, such as its ID, creation time, status, and associated tags. By providing the name of a specific Waypoint application or project, the command will display the builds for that particular entity.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `--app` flag in the `waypoint artifact list-builds` command is used to specify the name or identifier of the Kubernetes application that you want to retrieve the build artifacts for. This command, which is a part of the Waypoint open-source toolset for building and deploying applications, lists out the available build artifacts associated with the specified application. The `--app` flag ensures that only the artifacts for the selected application are displayed in the output.'
        long-ids: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint artifact list-builds --long-ids"` is used in Kubernetes to list all build artifacts with long IDs for a specific Waypoint project. Waypoint is a GitOps tool for building, releasing, and managing applications. This command retrieves the detailed information of each artifact, including its unique identifier, size, and creation time, making it useful for identifying and managing specific builds in a Kubernetes environment.'
        plain: |-
            [AI] The command `flag "waypoint artifact list-builds" --plain` is related to Waypoint, an open-source GitOps platform for Kubernetes. This specific command is used to list the available build artifacts with plain output.

            When you run `waypoint artifact list-builds --plain`, it will display a table of build artifacts with minimal formatting, showing essential information such as name, image digest, and status (success or error). The primary purpose is to provide a simple and quick way to check the availability and status of build artifacts within Waypoint.
        project: '[AI] The `--project` flag in the `waypoint artifact list-builds` command is used with Waypoint, an open-source GitOps tool for Kubernetes. This flag specifies which project''s build artifacts should be listed. Waypoint manages and syncs multiple projects, and this flag helps to filter and view only the artifacts related to a specific project.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint artifact list-builds --workspace"` is used in Waypoint, an open-source GitOps platform for Kubernetes. This specific command lists the builds in a given workspace. In other words, it displays information about the container images that have been built using Waypoint''s build functionality within the specified workspace.'
        workspace-all: '[AI] The command `flag "waypoint" artifact "list-builds" --workspace-all` is used with the Waypoint open-source tool for managing Kubernetes applications. This specific command requests Waypoint to list all available builds across all workspaces (or projects) in its configuration. In other words, it provides a summary of all the build artifacts that have been generated for each application in every defined workspace.'
