documentation:
    command: '[AI] `htop` is an interactive text-mode application for viewing and manipulating the processes running in a Unix-like operating system. It provides a more user-friendly interface compared to the traditional `top` command, with features like colorized output, customizable columns, and an intuitive interface using arrow keys or F keys for navigation. It''s particularly popular among system administrators for monitoring system performance and managing processes effectively.'
    flag:
        delay: '[AI] The `--delay` option in the `htop` command is used to adjust the delay time between screen updates. A longer delay value results in fewer screen refreshes, which can help reduce CPU usage and improve system performance, especially on resource-constrained systems. Conversely, a shorter delay value results in more frequent updates for real-time monitoring. The default delay time is typically around 500ms, but it can be adjusted using the `--delay` option followed by the desired number of milliseconds.'
        drop-capabilities: '[AI] The `--drop-capabilities` option in the `htop` utility is used to drop (remove) certain privileged capabilities that `htop` may have inherited from its parent process. By doing so, `htop` limits its own level of privilege, enhancing the system''s security. It''s important to note that dropping capabilities does not affect the functionality or features of `htop`. Instead, it helps minimize potential risks and vulnerabilities.'
        filter: '[AI] `htop` is an interactive process viewer and text-based terminal application for Unix-like operating systems. The `--filter` option is a command-line argument used with `htop`. It allows filtering the displayed processes based on specific criteria, such as a process name or command, using a regular expression pattern. This can be useful for quickly locating and managing certain processes in the system. For example, you can use `--filter=apache` to display only the Apache-related processes.'
        help: '[AI] `htop` is a popular interactive text-mode application used for inspecting and managing system processes. The `--help` option when invoked with `htop` displays detailed usage information about the program, including keys bindings, common commands, and other features. This can be helpful for users who want to quickly familiarize themselves with `htop` or need a refresher on specific functions.'
        highlight-changes: '[AI] `htop` is a popular terminal-based interactive process viewer for Unix-like operating systems. The `--highlight-changes` option is a feature in `htop` that highlights changes in the process list in real-time. This means that whenever a process is born, terminated, or its state (such as CPU usage) changes significantly, it will be highlighted in the process list for easy identification. This can be useful for monitoring system resources and keeping track of dynamic processes.'
        no-color: '[AI] The `htop` command is a popular interactive text-based Linux process viewer. The option `--no-color` disables the use of colors in the output of `htop`. This can be useful for users who prefer a monochrome display or are working in an environment where color is not supported (such as some terminal emulators or remote login sessions). Using this option ensures that all text and information displayed by `htop` is rendered using plain text, regardless of color capabilities.'
        no-mouse: '[AI] `htop` is a popular terminal-based interactive process viewer for Unix-like operating systems. The option `--no-mouse` disables mouse support in `htop`. This means that users must navigate the interface using only keyboard commands instead of clicking with a mouse. This can be useful for headless servers or for users who prefer to use the keyboard for all interactions.'
        no-unicode: '[AI] `htop` is a popular terminal-based interactive process viewer and text-based interface for exploring the running system. The option `--no-unicode` disables Unicode support in htop, meaning it will only display ASCII characters instead of various symbols and characters that come with Unicode encoding. This can be useful when using older terminals or systems where advanced character rendering may not be supported.'
        pid: '[AI] The `htop` command is a popular interactive process viewer for Unix-like operating systems. The option `--pid` is used to specify a process ID (PID) as an argument when invoking `htop`. This causes the application to display only the processes with the given PID in its tree or list view, filtering out other processes. For instance, running `htop --pid <PID>` will show you the details of that particular process.'
        readonly: '[AI] The `htop` command with the `--readonly` option is a text-based interactive process viewer and system monitor for Unix-like operating systems. When used with this option, `htop` runs in read-only mode, meaning it displays real-time system information but does not allow any user input or interaction. It''s useful for observing the system status in various conditions without any potential accidental modifications.'
        sort-key: '[AI] `htop` is a popular interactive process viewer for Unix-like operating systems. The `--sort-key` option is used to sort the process list based on a specific key when running `htop`. With no argument, it sorts by the process ID (PID) in ascending order. However, you can specify other keys such as `%CPU`, `%MEM`, or `COMMAND` to sort accordingly. For example, `--sort-key=%CPU` would display the processes sorted by their CPU usage from highest to lowest.'
        tree: '[AI] `htop --tree` is a command-line interface (CLI) utility for interactively exploring the processes running in a Unix or Linux system. The `--tree` option changes its display mode to show the process hierarchy in a tree format, making it easier to understand the relationships between parent and child processes. Each node represents a process, with the process ID (PID), name, and parent-child relationship indicated. Users can navigate through the tree using various keys to manage processes, including terminating or suspending them.'
        user: '[AI] `htop` is a popular interactive text-mode process viewer and manager for Unix-like operating systems. The `--user` option is a parameter that can be passed when invoking `htop`. This option causes the process list to be sorted based on the real user, rather than the process owner UID. This can be helpful in understanding which users are consuming the most system resources.'
        version: '[AI] `htop --version` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to display the version information of the htop utility, which is an interactive process viewer and text-based interface for the Linux ps and top commands. When executed, it prints out the htop version number, compilation options, and other relevant details such as the OS and compiler used to build it.'
