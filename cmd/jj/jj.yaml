documentation:
    command: '[AI] The "jj" command is a keyboard shortcut commonly used in Vi and Vim text editors. It functions as an inverse jump, meaning it takes you back one edit command in the history. For instance, if you made two ''j'' motions to move down a few lines, ''jj'' will take you back up to the previous position. This can be useful for quickly navigating through complex editing sequences.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] The `jj --help` command is used with the Jupyter Journal Notebook editor (jj). It displays a help message that provides information about available commands and their usage. This can be useful for users who want to learn more about the different features and functionalities of jupyter-journal or need a reminder of how to use specific commands. The help message includes detailed descriptions, examples, and optional flags or arguments.'
        version: '[AI] The command `jj --version` is used to check the version of Jupyter Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Jupyter Lab, which are popular interactive computing environments for data scientists and researchers. When you run this command in your terminal or command prompt, it will print out the current installed version of Jupyter along with any relevant build metadata.'
