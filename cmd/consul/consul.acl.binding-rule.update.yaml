It allows updating the definitions of binding rules, such as changing the rule name, modifying the entity or service selectors, or adjusting the permissions granted by the rule. This command is essential when you need to make changes to previously configured ACL binding rules for better security and access management within your Consul environment.'
    flag:
        bind-name: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update --bind-name` command is used to update an Access Control List (ACL) binding rule in Consul, a Connectivity and Service Discovery tool from Hashicorp. The `--bind-name` option specifies the name of the ACL binding to be updated. This command allows you to modify various aspects of an existing binding rule, such as its policies or the resources it manages. By using this command, you can maintain fine-grained control over who has access to which resources within your Consul environment.'
        bind-type: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update --bind-type` command is used to update an Access Control List (ACL) binding rule in Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool. This specific command is for updating rules with a particular bind type.

            Consul ACL allows defining roles and policies to control access to different parts of the Consul configuration. Binding rules are used to grant or deny permissions to specific resources within Consul, such as services, keys, and nodes.

            The `--bind-type` flag specifies the type of binding rule to be updated. Possible values include:

            1. `service` - For updating ACL rules related to service discovery.
            2. `key` - For updating ACL rules related to key/value storage.
            3. `node` - For updating ACL rules related to node registration and management.
            4. `event_json` - For updating ACL rules related to event notifications in JSON format.
            5. `catalog_catalog` - For updating ACL rules related to the Consul catalog service.

            By using this command with the appropriate flag, you can modify the permissions granted by a binding rule, update its attached policies or roles, and maintain fine-grained control over access within your Consul environment.
        ca-file: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update --ca-file` command is used to update ACL (Access Control List) binding rules in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. The `--ca-file` flag refers to the path of the Certificate Authority (CA) file, which is required to authenticate and encrypt the communication between the client and the Consul server when making ACL updates. This command ensures that only authorized clients with valid certificates can modify the binding rules in a secure manner.'
        ca-path: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update --ca-path` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration, to update Access Control List (ACL) binding rules with a specific CA (Certificate Authority) path. This CA path argument helps verify the authenticity of SSL/TLS certificates presented by clients and servers during communication in Consul''s gRPC API. The update command ensures that only certified entities are granted access to the targeted resources within the Consul environment, adding an additional layer of security for your infrastructure.'
        client-cert: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update` command is used to modify Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Hashicorp Consul, a connectivity and configuration management tool. The specific flag `--client-cert` indicates that the request is being made with a TLS client certificate for secure communication. This certificate will be required for authorization checks and must be provided to successfully execute the command and update the binding rules within the Consul ACL policy.'
        client-key: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update` command is used to modify Access Control List (ACL) binding rules in Hashicorp''s Consul service. The `--client-key` flag is an authentication parameter that specifies the unique client key associated with the client making the request. This flag ensures that only clients with the correct key can make changes to the ACL rules, adding a layer of security to the Consul configuration management process.'
        datacenter: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update --datacenter` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command is specifically related to Access Control Lists (ACLs) and datacenters in Consul.

            This command updates a binding rule under the context of a specific datacenter in Consul's ACL system. The binding rules define which clients have access to which services, depending on certain conditions like the requesting client ID or source address. By using `--datacenter` option, you can limit the scope of the binding rule update to a particular datacenter. This helps maintain security and isolation between different environments in Consul.
        description: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update` command with the `--description` flag is used to update an Access Control List (ACL) binding rule in Consul, which is a connectivity management tool. The `--description` flag allows you to specify a new description for the binding rule being updated. This helps keep track of what each rule does within the ACL configuration.'
        format: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update` command is used to modify ACL (Access Control List) binding rules in Hashicorp's Consul service. The `--format` option specifies the output format for the updated binding rule.

            Consul uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) as its configuration language. With the `--format` option, you can request the output of the command to be in HCL format so that it can be easily used to update or create new binding rules. This helps in maintaining a consistent and manageable configuration.

            For example, if you want to update an existing binding rule, you might use a command like:
            ```bash
            consul acl binding-rule update <rule-id> --name "my-updated-rule" --policy "deny" --targets "service=http_example" --tag-keys "env=production" --format hcl
            ```
            This command updates the specified binding rule with a new name, policy, targets, and tag keys. The `--format hcl` option returns the updated HCL representation of the binding rule that can be used to update the configuration in Consul or stored for future use.
        http-addr: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update --http-addr` command is used to update an Access Control List (ACL) binding rule in Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool. Specifically, this command updates the HTTP address associated with an existing binding rule. A binding rule defines which principals have access to which resources within a Consul Connect network. The `--http-addr` option specifies the new HTTP address for the binding rule. This command is typically used when the IP or DNS address of a service changes, and the ACL needs to be updated accordingly to maintain security policies in place.'
        id: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update --id` command is used to update an Access Control List (ACL) binding rule in Hashicorp Consul, a service discovery and configuration management tool.

            The `--id` flag is used to specify the unique identifier of the binding rule to be updated. The command allows you to modify various aspects of the binding rule, such as the permissions granted or the resources being accessed.

            In summary, this command updates an existing ACL binding rule in Consul with the given ID.
        meta: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update --meta` command is used to update metadata associated with Access Control List (ACL) binding rules in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. The `--meta` flag specifies that the operation will only modify the rule''s metadata without affecting its access control policy. This can be useful when you want to associate additional data with a binding rule without changing its permissions.'
        namespace: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update --namespace` command is used to update ACL (Access Control List) binding rules in Hashicorp Consul's access control list (ACL) system, specifically for the named namespace.

            Consul ACL allows you to manage access to resources within your service mesh or infrastructure using a policy-based model. Binding rules define which principals (entities that represent services or users) are granted specific permissions in the specified namespace. The update command modifies existing binding rules with new values for more granular control over who has access to what resources.

            The `--namespace` flag is used to specify the target namespace for the update operation. This ensures that changes only affect binding rules within the given namespace, allowing you to maintain a consistent and secure environment by isolating access controls as needed.
        no-merge: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update --no-merge` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. It updates an Access Control List (ACL) binding rule without merging any conflicting rules that might exist. This means that if multiple rules try to modify the same resource with different permissions, only the most recent rule applied will take effect, while others are discarded. The `--no-merge` option ensures that all conflicting rules are rejected and an error message is returned, alerting administrators of potential issues in their ACL policies.'
        selector: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update` command with the `--selector` option is used to update or modify ACL (Access Control List) binding rules in Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool.

            The `--selector` flag allows you to select specific binding rules based on certain attributes such as name, ID, or any other custom tag. With this selection, only the specified binding rules will be updated with the new configuration.

            For example, if you have several binding rules for a particular service, and you want to update the access control list (ACL) for one of them:

            ```sh
            consul acl binding-rule update <binding_rule_id> --selector name=<service_name> --bindings <principal>=<access_level>
            ```

            Replace `<binding_rule_id>` with the unique identifier of the binding rule you want to modify, `<service_name>` with the name of the service associated with this binding rule, and `<principal>` with the Consul entity (such as a user or role) that requires access, along with its access level (read or write).

            This command updates only the specified binding rule while leaving the others unchanged.
        stale: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update --stale` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source distributed, highly available, and data center aware solution to connect and secure services. This command allows updating ACL (Access Control List) binding rules with stale policies, which may no longer be up-to-date but still in effect.

            In other words, when you make changes to your Consul policies, it can take some time for all nodes to propagate those changes. If you need to update a binding rule before all nodes have received the new policy, you can use this command with the `--stale` flag to bypass the check for an up-to-date policy and apply the change immediately. Keep in mind that using stale policies carries the risk of applying outdated or incorrect access controls, so it should be used cautiously and only when necessary.
        tls-server-name: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update --tls-server-name` command is used to update TLS server name binding rules in Hashicorp Consul's Access Control List (ACL) system. This command is typically run by an administrator with appropriate permissions to modify ACL policies.

            Consul uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for secure communication between its components and clients. Binding rules define which principals (identities or services) are allowed to communicate with specific services based on various conditions, including TLS server names.

            When using this command, you specify the new TLS server name value to update the binding rule with. The updated rule will then only allow communication between the specified service and the principal if the client presents a valid certificate containing the updated server name during the secure connection. This helps ensure that only authorized clients are able to access your Consul services.
        token: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update --token` command is used to update ACL (Access Control List) binding rules in the Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. The `--token` argument specifies the token for an authenticated client making the request. This command allows administrators to modify the access permissions assigned to different entities (such as clients or services) within a Consul datacenter, enabling fine-grained control over who can interact with specific resources.'
        token-file: '[AI] The `consul acl binding-rule update` command is used to update binding rules in Consul''s Access Control List (ACL) system. The `--token-file` flag specifies the path to a file containing an ACL token, which grants the necessary permissions to execute this command. By using this flag, the user authenticates and authorizes the command to make changes to the binding rules in Consul''s ACL configuration.'
