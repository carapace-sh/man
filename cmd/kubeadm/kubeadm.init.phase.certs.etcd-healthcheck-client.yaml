description: Generate the certificate for liveness probes to healthcheck etcd
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save and store the certificates.
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubernetes-version=: Choose a specific Kubernetes version for the control plane.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command `kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client` is used to generate and configure SSL certificates specifically for the ETCD member''s health check client in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. This certificate ensures secure communication between the Kubernetes control plane and the etcd members, which store the cluster data.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: '[AI] The `kubeadm init` command is used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The option `phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client --cert-dir <path>` instructs `kubeadm` to generate and output the certificates required for the ETCD health check client, which is used to monitor the availability of the ETCD servers in your Kubernetes cluster. These certificates are saved in the specified directory `<path>`.'
        config: |-
            [AI] The `kubeadm init` command is used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client --config` argument is specific to the certification generation phase of this process.

            This option generates client certificate and key for the Etcd Healthcheck Client. Etcd is the distributed key-value store that holds the current configuration of the cluster and is critical for Kubernetes cluster functionality. The healthcheck client is a tool used to periodically check the health and readiness of etcd members in the cluster.

            The `--config` flag specifies the output file where the generated client certificate and key will be saved, which can then be used to configure and authenticate the Etcd Healthcheck Client with the Kubernetes cluster.
        kubernetes-version: '[AI] The command `kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client --kubernetes-version` is used to generate and configure the SSL certificates for the ETCD member in a Kubernetes cluster, specifically for the etcd-healthcheck-client. This client is responsible for monitoring the health of the ETCD members in the cluster using the etcd Healthcheck API. The `--kubernetes-version` flag specifies which version of Kubernetes to use when generating the certificates.'
