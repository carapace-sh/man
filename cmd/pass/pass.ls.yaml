documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pass ls` command is not a valid command in common Unix-like operating systems such as Linux or MacOS. There seems to be a mistake in the given command as `pass` is a password manager utility, and `ls` is a command used for listing files and directories. Each command is typically run separately in the terminal.'
