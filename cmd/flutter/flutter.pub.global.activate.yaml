documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flutter pub global activate` is a command used in Flutter development to globally install and set up a specific package for use across all projects in your Flutter environment. This command interacts with the `flutterpub` global tool, registering the specified package for easy access without having to include it in every project''s `pubspec.yaml` file.'
    flag:
        executable: '[AI] The `flutter pub global activate --executable` command is used to register a specific executable (a Dart or Flutter tool) with the Flutter Global Package Manager (Flutter pub). This allows you to easily access and use the registered tool from your terminal, without having to specify the full path every time. When you run this command followed by the name of an executable that is locally installed in your `~/.pub-cache/global_tools` directory, Flutter pub will make it available system-wide for use.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `flutter pub global activate` is a command used in Flutter development to configure your project to use a specific global package, instead of having it managed at the project level. The `--help` option displays detailed help information about this command. Here's what you can expect:

            Usage: `flutter pub global activate <package_name>`

            Activates the specified global package for your project. The `<package_name>` is the name of the package you want to use globally. For example, `flutter pub global activate flutter_test`.

            Options:
            - None

            Examples:
            To enable a global package named 'flutter_tools', use: `flutter pub global activate flutter_tools`

            Help:
            Displays help information about the command. Use it like this: `flutter pub global activate --help`.

            The command modifies your `pubspec.yaml` file to add the specified global package under the `dev_dependencies` section, and then installs it globally using the Flutter's `pub get` functionality. Using global packages can help manage project-wide tools or libraries that don't necessarily belong to individual projects.
        hosted-url: '[AI] The `flutter pub global activate --hosted-url` command is used to configure the Flutter package manager (`pub`) to use a specific hosted URL for downloading packages. This is useful when working with private or custom packages that are not available on the public Flutter Gallery. By setting the hosted URL, you can access these packages as if they were publicly available. This command sets the global configuration for all projects using the current user account.'
        no-executables: '[AI] The `flutter pub global activate --no-executables` command is used in Flutter development to configure the global packages manager, Dart, to use a specific global package version without installing any executable or binary files associated with it. This can be useful when working on multiple projects that rely on different versions of the same package. By using `--no-executables`, only the library code is installed instead of the full package including binaries or utilities, reducing potential conflicts and keeping global packages lean.'
        overwrite: '[AI] `flutter pub global activate --overwrite` is a command used in Flutter development to set or update a project''s global package dependencies using the Flutter Package Manager (pub). The `--overwrite` flag allows replacing any existing global packages with new ones having the same name, ensuring that all projects using the same global packages have consistent versions.'
        source: '[AI] The `flutter pub global activate --source` command is used to set a specific package repository as the default source for the Flutter `pub get` tool. This command configures the global installation of the Flutter SDK, allowing you to easily access packages from that source when using the `pub get` command without specifying the source each time. The `--source` option followed by a valid package repository URL is used to specify the desired source.'
