documentation:
    command: '[AI] `wezterm cli spawn` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for Unix-based systems. It allows users to open a new terminal tab or pane with a specific command already running inside it. The command and its arguments are passed as arguments to the `spawn` command. For example: `wezterm cli spawn -- sh`. This command opens a new terminal tab with the Shell (sh) as the initial process.'
    flag:
        cwd: '[AI] The `wezterm cli spawn --cwd` command is used in WezTerm, a modern terminal emulator, to open a new terminal tab or window with a specific working directory (represented by the `--cwd` option). This command does not create or manage sessions or profiles, it only opens a new instance of WezTerm with the given working directory as its initial working directory.'
        domain-name: |-
            [AI] `wezterm cli spawn --domain-name` is a command used in Wezterm, a terminal emulator for Unix and Windows. This command is used to open a new terminal tab or window with a specific SSH or TELNET connection.

            The `--domain-name` option specifies the label or name of the tab or window. It does not directly relate to the domain name of an SSH server or website for TELNET, but rather it's just a user-defined name given to the terminal session for easy identification within Wezterm.
        help: '[AI] `wezterm cli spawn --help` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for Unix and Windows. This command displays help information about the `spawn` subcommand. It allows users to create new terminal tabs or panes by specifying the command to run, arguments, and other options. The help output explains the various flags and their meanings, providing users with guidance on how to effectively use the `spawn` command for creating custom terminal sessions.'
        new-window: '[AI] `wezterm cli spawn --new-window` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for UNIX-based systems. This command opens a new WezTerm window from the command line interface (CLI) without attaching it to any existing session. The "--new-window" flag ensures that a new window is created instead of appending a new tab to an existing one.'
        pane-id: '[AI] The `wezterm cli spawn --pane-id` command is used in WezTerm, a modern terminal emulator, to open a new process or application within a specific pane or tab of the terminal window. The `--pane-id` argument specifies the unique identifier of the target pane where you want to launch the command or application. This command is helpful when managing multiple panes and applications in a WezTerm session.'
        window-id: '[AI] `wezterm cli spawn --window-id` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator that supports powerful customization and advanced features. This command is for programmatically launching new terminal sessions from the command line. The `--window-id` option specifies the ID of an existing window or workspace to attach the new session to. By doing this, multiple terminal tabs or windows can be managed as a single group, allowing users to easily navigate between them and share copy/paste data between sessions.'
        workspace: '[AI] `wezterm cli spawn --workspace` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for Unix and Windows. It starts a new terminal session with a specific workspace configuration. Workspaces allow users to organize multiple tabs into logical groups, making it easier to manage complex terminal setups. The `--workspace` flag specifies which workspace to use when starting the new session.'
