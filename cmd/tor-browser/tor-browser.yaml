        dir: '[AI] `tor-browser --dir` is a command used with the Tor Browser, which is a free software package designed to provide privacy and anonymity online by routing internet traffic through the Tor network. The `--dir` option is used to specify or retrieve the data directory of the Tor Browser. When you run this command without any arguments, it will display the path to the current Tor Browser''s data directory. If you provide a new path as an argument, it sets the data directory for future uses. This allows users to manage their settings, cookies, and browser history independently across multiple instances of the Tor Browser.'
        erase: |-
            [AI] The `--erase` option is a command-line argument for Tor Browser, which is a free software application that allows users to access the internet anonymously by routing their connections through the Tor network.

            This option is used to erase all browsing andTor usage history, including cookies, session data, browser history, and cache. This helps to leave no trace of the user's online activities on the local computer. The `--erase` command does not remove the Tor configuration files or settings, it only clears out the browser-specific data.

            It's important to note that using `--erase` does not provide anonymity while browsing and does not protect against traffic analysis or other forms of potential surveillance. It simply cleans up the local machine after use for those who value privacy.
        help: '[AI] The `--help` option when used with the Tor Browser command line interface displays comprehensive help information about how to use the Tor Browser. This includes details on various command line arguments and their functions, such as specifying a proxy configuration or enabling experimental features. It provides a summary of all available options and their usage, making it an essential resource for understanding the capabilities and functionality of the Tor Browser when used in a non-default manner.'
        refresh: '[AI] `tor-browser --refresh` is a command used in Tor Browser, which is a privacy-focused web browser designed to protect user anonymity by routing internet traffic through the Tor network. The `--refresh` option triggers the download and installation of the latest Tor Browser bundle, updating all components including the Tor network software, the browser itself, and its add-ons, ensuring that users have the most recent security features and privacy enhancements available.'
        update: '[AI] `tor-browser --update` is a command used in Tor Browser, which is a privacy-focused web browser designed to protect user anonymity by routing internet traffic through the Tor network. This specific command initiates an update check for Tor Browser and its components, including the Tor network itself, to ensure that users have the latest security features and bug fixes. Running `tor-browser --update` provides the user with a secure and up-to-date browsing experience, enhancing their online privacy and security.'
