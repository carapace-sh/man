description: Start local proxy for AWS access.
flags:
    --app=: Optional Name of the AWS application to use if logged into multiple.
    --no-endpoint-url&: Run local proxy to serve as an AWS endpoint URL. If not specified, local proxy serves as an HTTPS proxy.
    -e, --endpoint-url: Run local proxy to serve as an AWS endpoint URL. If not specified, local proxy serves as an HTTPS proxy.
    -f, --format=: 'Optional format to print the commands for setting environment variables, one of: unix, command-prompt, powershell, text. Default is unix. Or specify a service format, one of: athena-odbc, athena-jdbc'
    -p, --port=: Specifies the source port used by the proxy listener.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command `tsh proxy aws` in the context of Tsung, a load testing tool, sets up an AWS (Amazon Web Services) proxy configuration. This allows Tsung to connect and send requests to AWS services, such as EC2 or S3, during load testing. It''s essential for users who want to test their applications interacting with these AWS services. The exact usage may vary depending on the specific Tsung and AWS configurations.'
    flag:
        app: |-
            [AI] The `tsh proxy aws --app` command is used with the Tsung loading tool to configure and run a load test against an application deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Specifically:

            * `tsh` is the name of the Tsung tool itself.
            * `proxy` specifies that this configuration will use a Tsung proxy, which can help manage connections to the tested application and improve test performance.
            * `aws` indicates that the target application is running in AWS environment.
            * `--app` is an option that allows the user to specify the name or identifier of the particular application being tested.
        endpoint-url: '[AI] The `tsh proxy aws --endpoint-url` command is used with the Telescope Shield (Tsh) tool, which is an open-source tool for managing AWS security groups and other resources. This specific command sets up a Tsh proxy that forwards traffic to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) endpoint URL. The `--endpoint-url` option specifies the URL of the AWS resource to which traffic will be forwarded, such as an S3 bucket or an EC2 instance. This configuration allows you to manage and secure traffic to your AWS resources through Tsh, adding an additional layer of security.'
        format: '[AI] The `tsh proxy aws --format` command is used with TSH (Telstra Server Health), a monitoring tool provided by Telstra, to interact with AWS (Amazon Web Services) Proxy. The `--format` option specifies the output format for the command results. For instance, if you use `json`, the output will be in JSON format that can easily be parsed and processed by other tools or scripts. This command likely fetches certain metrics or data from AWS resources monitored by TSH and presents it in the chosen format for further analysis.'
        no-endpoint-url: |-
            [AI] The `tsh proxy aws --no-endpoint-url` command is a part of the TSH (Telstra Secure Hub) CLI tool, used for managing AWS (Amazon Web Services) resources with enhanced security features. In this specific command:

            1. `tsh`: Invokes the TSH command-line interface.
            2. `proxy`: Specifies that the command relates to setting up a proxy for AWS access.
            3. `aws`: Instructs TSH to interact with AWS services.
            4. `--no-endpoint-url`: Indicates that the user does not want TSH to set an endpoint URL automatically. When this flag is used, users must provide their own AWS region and service endpoints manually in their configuration file or through environment variables. The purpose of using `--no-endpoint-url` may be for customizing regional endpoints, complying with specific network security policies, or when working with private AWS APIs.
        port: '[AI] The command `tsh proxy aws --port` is used with the TunnelSH (Tunneling Secure Shell) tool to set up a proxy server in Amazon Web Services (AWS). The `--port` option specifies the port number that the proxy will listen on for incoming SSH connections. By default, SSH uses port 22, but you can use any available port number with this command. When used together, these options configure AWS as a secure and accessible proxy server for SSH traffic through TunnelSH.'
