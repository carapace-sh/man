    command: |-
        [AI] The `waypoint config set` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source multi-backend configuration management tool, to modify the values of specific configuration variables. The syntax is as follows:

        ```bash
        waypoint config set <module-path> <variable-name> <value>
        ```

        In this command:

        * `<module-path>` specifies the path to the Waypoint module that contains the variable to be modified.
        * `<variable-name>` is the name of the configuration variable.
        * `<value>` is the new value you want to set for the variable.
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The command `flag "waypoint config set" --app` is used in Waypoint, an open-source multi-cloud infrastructure automation platform, to configure application-specific settings. The `set` subcommand modifies the values of given configuration keys for a specific application. For instance, `--app <application_name>` specifies which application''s configuration to modify. This command is useful when you need to customize an application''s behavior without modifying its source code directly.'
        label-scope: '[AI] The `waypoint config set --label-scope` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool. It sets the label scope for a specific configuration item. Label scopes define how labels are matched and applied within a given context, such as a Kubernetes namespace or a Terraform module. By setting the label scope, Waypoint knows which resources to update with the specified labels when running an apply or sync command.'
        plain: '[AI] The command `flag "waypoint config set" --plain` is used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. This command sets a value for a configuration variable in a Terraform module or workflow file, using Waypoint, Terraform''s continuous delivery platform. The `--plain` flag makes the output of the command human-readable and without any formatting or encoding.'
        project: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint config set --project` command in Waypoint, an open-source multi-cloud infrastructure automation tool, is used to update or modify the configuration of a specific project.

            This command takes a key-value pair argument where the key is the name of the project and the value is the updated configuration data. It overwrites any existing configuration for the specified project with the new data. This command can be used to make changes to variables, modules, or other configuration settings in a Waypoint project file.
        runner: |-
            [AI] The `flag "waypoint config set --runner"` is a command used in the Waypoint configuration management tool. It's specifically used to set the runner configuration for a given Waypoint module.

            Runners are the agents or machines that apply the configured infrastructure changes. When using multiple runners, it's essential to configure each one appropriately based on its environment.

            This flag sets the specific runner configuration by updating the `runner` section in the Waypoint module file. This way, you can customize each runner with specific connection details like access keys, credentials, or any other required configurations.
        scope: '[AI] The `waypoint config set --scope` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool. This command sets or updates a specific configuration value for a given scope in Waypoint. A scope represents a logical grouping of resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, AWS account, or Azure subscription. By specifying the scope along with the configuration key and new value, you can modify the behavior of your managed infrastructure.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint config set --workspace` command is used in Google Cloud''s open-source infrastructure automation tool, Waypoint, to configure or modify the active workspace. Waypoint supports multiple workspaces that can represent different environments (e.g., development, staging, production), and this command sets the currently active workspace for future Waypoint commands. The new workspace is specified as an argument to the command.'
        workspace-scope: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint config set --workspace-scope"` is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool. This flag sets the scope of a configuration item to the current workspace only, instead of applying it across all workspaces. By using this flag, you can make workspace-specific configurations without affecting other workspaces. It helps maintain isolation and flexibility when managing your infrastructure configurations with Waypoint.'
