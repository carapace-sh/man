        1. Creating, listing, updating, and deleting TLS certificates and keys.
        2. Assigning TLS certificates to various Consul services or clients.
        3. Enabling secure communication between services and clients using TLS.

        This command is essential for securing communication in Consul clusters and maintaining encryption between different components.
