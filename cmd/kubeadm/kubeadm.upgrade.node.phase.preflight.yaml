documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm upgrade node phase preflight` command is used to validate the prerequisites for upgrading a Kubernetes node with Kubeadm. It checks various conditions on the node such as OS version, container runtime, and networking configurations before allowing an upgrade to proceed. The output of this command provides information about any identified issues that need to be addressed before running the actual node upgrade command.'
    flag:
        ignore-preflight-errors: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm upgrade node` is a command used to perform an in-place Kubernetes cluster upgrade with kubeadm. The `preflight` subcommand checks various prerequisites before initiating the upgrade process.

            The option `--ignore-preflight-errors` tells kubeadm to proceed with the upgrade even if some preflight checks fail. This can be useful in specific situations where you know that certain issues are safe to ignore and won't affect the upgrade or the functionality of the cluster after upgrading. However, it is generally recommended to address all preflight errors before upgrading to ensure a stable and functional cluster post-upgrade.

            Using `--ignore-preflight-errors` should be used with caution and only when you are confident that the ignored checks won't cause issues in your environment.
