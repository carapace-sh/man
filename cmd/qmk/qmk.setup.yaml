documentation:
    command: '[AI] `qmk setup` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware ecosystem to initialize and configure a new keyboard project. It sets up the necessary directory structure, creates essential files, and installs required dependencies. Run this command in a terminal or command prompt from within the desired keyboard project directory.'
    flag:
        baseurl: '[AI] `qmk setup --baseurl` is a command used in the QMK keyboard firmware project to configure the build system. The `--baseurl` option sets the base URL for the remote repository from which QMK will fetch its dependencies, specifically for the Keyboard-layout-editor (KLE) and Bootmagic libraries. This command is essential when using a private or custom repository for these libraries instead of the public ones.'
        branch: '[AI] `qmk setup --branch` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project to checkout and switch between different branches or versions of the QMK codebase. The `--branch` option specifies the desired branch name, allowing users to easily manage multiple branches, such as stable releases, development builds, or custom modifications.'
        help: '[AI] `qmk setup --help` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project to display help information about the setup tool. The tool assists users in configuring their keyboard layouts, keymaps, and other features of the QMK firmware. This specific command invokes the help function, providing an overview of available commands and usage instructions for each one. It''s a valuable resource for anyone new to the QMK platform or wanting to modify existing configurations.'
        home: '[AI] `qmk setup --home` is a command used in the QMK keyboard firmware project to configure and initialize the software environment for building custom keyboard firmware from source. The `--home` option specifies that the initialization process should be performed within the user''s home directory, creating or updating the necessary subdirectories and files for managing and compiling QMK projects efficiently. This command sets up a consistent project structure, enabling easy access to commonly used tools, templates, and configuration files.'
        "no": '[AI] `qmk setup --no` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware development platform for setting up keyboards with specific features without creating a new project or using a QMK configuration file. The "--no" flag indicates that no new project will be created, making it useful for modifying existing projects directly. This command does not create a new keymap file but instead allows the user to run other setup tasks such as adding new libraries or features to an existing project without having to start from scratch.'
        "yes": '[AI] `qmk setup --yes` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware to perform an automated setup process with confirmed prompts. This means that the script will run through all necessary steps for configuring a QMK project, such as creating keymap files, setting up dependencies, and compiling the firmware, without requiring manual intervention at each step. The `--yes` flag grants permission to answer "yes" to all prompts automatically, making the setup process faster and more efficient.'
