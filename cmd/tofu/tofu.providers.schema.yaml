        [AI] The command "tofu providers schema" is likely related to Tufunan Object Serialization Format (TOSF) or TOFU, a data serialization and interoperability standard used in Hadoop DataFlow and Apache Beam data processing pipelines.

        In this context, the term "schema" refers to the structure of data, defining the types and arrangement of fields within records. "Providers" are implementations of different data formats or serializers/deserializers for TOSF. Therefore, the command is likely asking for information about the schema or data structure supported by specific TOFU providers.
    flag:
        json: |-
            [AI] The `"tofu providers schema - json"` is not a standard flag or term in technology or data science. It appears to be a misnamed string, possibly meant to represent the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format of a schema for tofu providers' data. In this context:

            1. "Tofu providers": This likely refers to entities that supply or produce tofu, a popular soy food in East Asian cuisine.
            2. "Schema": A structure or organization that defines the relationship between different data elements within a dataset.
            3. "-json": This is an abbreviation for "in JSON format." It indicates that the output will be presented as a JSON document.

            So, if we assume this flag's correct intention, it likely refers to generating or requesting a JSON representation of the schema defining the structure and relationships in data related to tofu providers.
