description: The missing package manager for macOS
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `brew` is a package manager for Homebrew, a popular software installation system for macOS. It manages the installation and upgrades of software packages and dependencies using simple commands in the terminal. For example, you can install a package like `python3` with the command `brew install python`. The Homebrew formulae, which define how each package is installed, are stored in a repository on GitHub, ensuring that the latest stable versions of software are easily accessible.'
