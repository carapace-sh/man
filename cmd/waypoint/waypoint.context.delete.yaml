documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint context delete` command is used in Waypoint, a multi-host application deployment tool by Docker, to remove an existing context. A Waypoint context defines a set of applications and their respective environments, making it easy to manage deployments across multiple clusters or environments. By deleting a context, you''re essentially removing the associated applications and environments from Waypoint''s control.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint context delete --all"` is a command used in Kubernetes to delete all the contexts stored in your local kubeconfig file. Contexts in Kubernetes are essentially collections of clusters, users, and namespaces that allow you to easily switch between different environments with a single command. By using `--all` flag, all existing contexts will be deleted from your local configuration. Be cautious when using this command as it may disrupt your workflow if used unintentionally.'
        app: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint context delete --app"` is a command used in Kubernetes using the Waypoint CLI tool. It is used to delete an entire application context, including all associated resources such as deployments, services, and config maps, from a given Kubernetes cluster. This can be useful for removing old or unused applications, simplifying the management of multiple applications, or preparing for infrastructure changes.'
        plain: '[AI] The command `flag "waypoint context delete" --plain` is used in Kubernetes to delete a specific context from the current kubectl configuration file. The `--plain` option ensures that the output of the command is just the raw YAML data, without any additional formatting or explanatory messages. This can be useful when programmatically managing your Kubernetes configurations.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint context delete --project` command is used to delete a specific project context in Waypoint, an open-source application delivery platform by Microsoft. This command deletes the locally stored configuration for the specified project, effectively removing it from your local Waypoint environment. When you run this command with the `--project` flag followed by the name of your project, Waypoint removes the associated context data, including credentials and deployment configurations. This command is helpful when you no longer need to manage a specific project in Waypoint or want to start fresh with a clean configuration.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint context delete --workspace"` is a command used in Waypoint, an open-source application deployment and management tool by Docker. This command is utilized to delete a specific workspace context from Waypoint''s configuration. Workspaces define the context for your applications, including the target infrastructure, environment variables, and other settings. Deleting a workspace context removes its associated configurations, allowing you to manage and deploy applications within a new or different context.'
