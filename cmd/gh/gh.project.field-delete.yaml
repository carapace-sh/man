        [AI] The `gh` command with the `project field-delete` subcommand is used in GitHub's command-line tool (Git Hub CLI) to delete specific project fields in a GitHub Project. This can be useful for updating or removing certain pieces of information associated with a project, such as labels or collaborators. The basic syntax for this command is:

        ```bash
        gh project update [PROJECT] --field key1=value1 --field key2=value2 ... --field keyN=valueN [--force]
        ```

        Replace `[PROJECT]` with the name or ID of your GitHub Project, and `keyN` with the specific field name you want to update or remove. For instance, to delete a label named "status:blocked" from a project, use:

        ```bash
        gh project update [PROJECT] --field status.labels='*status:blocked'=
        ```

        The `--force` flag can be used if you want to remove the field without confirmation. Keep in mind that deleting some fields might not be possible, depending on your GitHub organization settings or permissions. Always make sure to double-check before running this command, as incorrect usage could result in unintended consequences.

        format: |-
            [AI] The `gh project field-delete` is a command from GitHub's `gh` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, used to delete specific project fields in GitHub projects. The `--format` option specifies the output format for the command result. By default, it's printed to the console. With `--format`, you can customize the output to suit your needs using Mustache templates. For example:

            ```bash
            gh project field-delete ID --field id,name --format json
            ```

            This command deletes a specific project field with the given 'ID' and specifies that the output should be in JSON format.
        id: '[AI] The `gh project field-delete` is a command used in the GitHub CLI (Git Hub Command Line Interface) to delete a specific project field identified by its ID. The `--id` option is used to specify the unique identifier of the field to be deleted. This command modifies the project configuration, allowing for customization and management of GitHub projects using the terminal.'
        jq: '[AI] `gh project field-delete` is a GitHub command used to delete specific fields or keys from a project''s configuration file. The `--jq` flag is an optional argument passed to the `jq` filtering tool for processing and manipulating JSON data. When using both commands together, `gh project field-delete` first removes the specified fields in the project file, and then `--jq` filters or transforms the output JSON according to provided queries. The combined command allows for efficient management and modification of a project''s configuration.'
        template: '[AI] `gh project field-delete` is a command used in the GitHub CLI (gh) tool to delete custom fields from a GitHub Project. The `--template` option specifies the name of the JSON file containing the definition of the custom field to be deleted. When executed, this command deletes the specified custom field from all projects where it appears, and removes the corresponding key-value pairs from the template file.'
