description: Docker Scan
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker scan` command is not a built-in Docker command. It seems like there might be some confusion with this command, as it''s not part of Docker''s official CLI toolset. Instead, "docker scan" could refer to various tools that perform security vulnerability scanning for images or containers. These tools often integrate with the Docker platform but are not actually Docker commands themselves. Examples include Clair, Twelve Security, and Anchore Engine. These tools scan images for known vulnerabilities in their base layers and other components, helping to ensure the security of your Docker environment.'
