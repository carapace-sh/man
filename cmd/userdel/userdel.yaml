documentation:
    command: '[AI] `userdel` is a Linux command used to remove user accounts along with their home directories and other associated data. The basic syntax is: `userdel [OPTION]... USERNAME`. Without any options, only the account will be deleted. To remove the user''s home directory and other files as well, use the `-r` option: `userdel -r [OPTION]... USERNAME`. It is important to note that this command does not delete system logs or other files that may reference the user. Additionally, deleting a user account does not affect any group memberships.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `userdel` is a Linux command used to delete user accounts and associated files, such as home directories and mail spools. The `--force` option (also written as `-r`) is used with `userdel` to remove the account and its associated files and directories forcefully without asking for confirmation. This can be useful if you are certain that the user account and related data can safely be deleted, but it''s important to use this command with caution to avoid unintended data loss.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `userdel` is a Linux command used to delete user accounts and associated files. The `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use this command. Here's a brief summary:

            - `userdel [OPTIONS] [USER]`: The basic syntax of the command, where `[USER]` is the name of the account to be deleted.
            - `--help, -h`: Displays detailed usage information and lists all available options.
            - `--remove-home-dir, -r`: Removes the home directory of the user and any files within it (be careful with this option!).
            - `--keep-home, -n`: Only deletes the account and associated entries in system databases, leaving the home directory untouched.
            - `--force, -rF`: Forcefully removes the home directory without prompting for confirmation.
            - `--quiet, -Q`: Suppresses informational messages when running the command.
        prefix: '[AI] `userdel` is a command in Linux used to delete user accounts. The option `--prefix=PREFIX` specifies that only the account files located under the given prefix directory should be deleted, leaving other instances of the account unchanged on other systems or partitions. Without this flag, deleting a user with `userdel` would remove all occurrences of the user''s home directory and other related files.'
        remove: '[AI] `userdel` is a command used in Unix and Linux systems for deleting user accounts. The `--remove` option (or simply `-r`) tells the command to also remove the home directory associated with that account, as well as any files or directories owned by that user but not specifically assigned to another user via file permissions. In summary, `userdel --remove <username>` will completely delete a user account along with its associated data in one command.'
        root: '[AI] `userdel` is a command in Unix-like operating systems for deleting a user account. The option `--root` specifies that the given argument is the root directory of the system where the user account exists, instead of assuming it''s the local system. So, if you want to delete a user account from a remote system, you would use this option followed by the target system''s IP address or hostname. For example: `userdel --root=remote_system username`.'
