description: Print the list of flags inherited by all commands
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubectl options` is a command used with the Kubernetes command-line interface (CLI) tool, `kubectl`. It is not a standalone command but rather a modifier that can be added to other `kubectl` commands to provide additional flags or customizations. For instance, `kubectl create deployment my-app --image=my-registry/my-image:v1 --options --record=true`. Here, `--options` is used to pass an optional file containing custom Kubernetes YAML configurations when creating a new deployment.'
