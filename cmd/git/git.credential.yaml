        [AI] `git credential` is a Git command used to manage and handle authentication credentials, such as username and password for a specific repository or hosting service like GitHub. It is typically used in two main sub-commands: `git credential store` and `git credential erase`.

        * `git credential store`: This command saves the given credentials for the provided URL so that they will be automatically supplied to Git when needed.
        * `git credential erase`: This command removes stored credentials for a specific URL or globally.

        These commands help in managing and securing your Git authentication information, ensuring that you don't have to manually enter your credentials every time you interact with a particular repository.
