description: Undo an operation (shortcut for `jj op undo`)
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `jj undo` command is a vi keybinding used in various text editors, including Vim and Neovim. It corresponds to the standard Vi "undo" command (`u`), but with the additional "jump" motion `jj`. This binding allows the user to undo their last action and then immediately go back to their previous position in the text without having to move the cursor manually. Essentially, it combines the functionality of both an undo and a jump command into one convenient shortcut.'
