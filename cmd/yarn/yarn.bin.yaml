    command: '[AI] The `yarn bin` command is used to display the list of globally installed packages and their corresponding executable files in a Yarn project. It searches for installed packages with a `bin` script, and then outputs the command that can be used to run those scripts from the terminal. For example, if you have Node.js installed globally and Angular CLI as a global package, running `yarn bin angular` would output `angular`.'
    flag:
        json: '[AI] `yarn bin --json` is a command used in Yarn, a popular JavaScript package manager. This command returns metadata about the installed CLI (Command Line Interface) tools registered under `yarn global bin`.
