    command: '[AI] "Vagrant Cloud" is not a command but a service provided by Hashicorp, the company behind Vagrant, for managing and sharing Vagrant box files. With Vagrant Cloud, you can discover, download, and manage boxes from a centralized repository using simple URLs or by using the `vagrant box add` command followed by the box name and version from the cloud. It simplifies the process of maintaining and distributing Vagrant boxes and makes it easier for users to access and use them in their projects.'
