documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker stack deploy` is a command used with Docker Swarm mode to create or update a multi-service application stack. It takes one argument, which is the name of the stack, followed by YAML files that define the services and their configurations. The command deploys each service in the YAML file, networks them appropriately, and manages the scale of each replica based on the defined specifications.'
    flag:
        compose-file: '[AI] `docker stack deploy` is a command used in Docker Swarm to deploy a multi-container application defined by a Compose file. The `--compose-file` option specifies the path to the Compose file, which contains the definition of the services, networks, and volumes for the application. When you run `docker stack deploy <app_name> --compose-file <path_to_compose_file>`, Docker Swarm orchestrates the deployment of the services defined in the Compose file across the nodes in your Swarm cluster. This includes creating and configuring networks, placing containers on nodes with sufficient resources, and starting the services.'
        prune: '[AI] `docker stack deploy --prune` is a command used in Docker Swarm mode to update or create services and their associated containers in a defined stack, while also removing stopped and unneeded services and their associated networks and volumes. The `--prune` flag ensures that only running services are kept, making the configuration leaner by removing idle resources and reducing resource usage.'
        resolve-image: '[AI] `docker stack deploy --resolve-images` is a command used in Docker Swarm to deploy a new or update an existing multi-service application stack. The `--resolve-images` flag instructs Docker to resolve and pull any images that have been specified in the stack definition but are not currently available on the swarm. This ensures that all required images are present before the deployment process begins, avoiding potential errors due to missing images.'
        with-registry-auth: '[AI] `docker stack deploy --with-registry-auth` is a command used in Docker Swarm mode to deploy a multi-service application defined in a `docker-stack.yml` file. The `--with-registry-auth` flag enables the use of a `docker-credentials.json` file for authenticated access to private registries when pulling images during stack deployment. This command ensures that the specified services are scheduled and run on Swarm nodes, with appropriate network connectivity and registry authentication.'
