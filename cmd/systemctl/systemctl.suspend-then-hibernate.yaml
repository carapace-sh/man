documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `systemctl` command with the arguments `suspend-then-hibernate` is used to put a Linux system into both suspension (also known as standby mode) and hibernation (also known as sleep-and-wake). In this state, the system consumes minimal power and can quickly resume normal operation when needed. It first suspends the system to save the current state of the RAM to the swap space or another storage device, then enters hibernation to fully power off the computer. When the system is awakened, it resumes from the saved state in the swap space or storage device. This command requires administrative privileges and may not be supported on all systems depending on hardware capabilities.'
