    command: '[AI] `brew update-python-resources` is a Homebrew command used to update Python''s installed packages and resources. It fetches the latest versions of these packages from their respective repositories, ensuring that your Python environment remains current with the latest packages and improvements.'
    flag:
        debug: |-
            [AI] `brew update-python-resources` is a command provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, used to manage Python installations. The `--debug` flag is an optional argument that enables verbose output during the execution of this command.

            When you run `brew update-python-resources --debug`, it will perform the following actions:

            1. Update the list of available Python versions and their respective dependencies in Homebrew's repositories.
            2. Identify any local changes or customizations to your Python installations.
            3. Merge any local changes with the updated Homebrew configurations, if necessary.
            4. Apply updates to Python resources such as packages and modules.
            5. Display detailed information about each step taken during the update process in the terminal output, which can be useful for troubleshooting or understanding what exactly is happening when running this command.
        exclude-packages: '[AI] The `brew update-python-resources` command is a Homebrew (a popular package manager for macOS) utility that manages Python installations. The `--exclude-packages` option specifies that no additional Python packages should be updated during the operation. This means that only the system resources related to Python, such as its base installation and any included data or configurations, will be updated without affecting other installed Python packages.'
        extra-packages: '[AI] The `brew update-python-resources` command is a Homebrew (a popular package manager for macOS) utility that updates Python''s included packages and resources. The `--extra-packages` option extends this action to include installing additional packages specified in the `Python: extra-packages` configuration file. This command keeps your Python installation up-to-date and ensures you have access to the latest third-party packages.'
        help: '[AI] The `brew update-python-resources` command is a Homebrew (a package manager for macOS) utility used to manage and update Python''s installed packages and resources. Specifically, the `--help` flag is an option that provides detailed information about how to use this command. It prints out extensive usage instructions, available options, and their descriptions. This can help users understand how to correctly call the command with various arguments for achieving specific tasks related to Python management on macOS via Homebrew.'
        ignore-non-pypi-packages: |-
            [AI] `brew update-python-resources` is a command provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to manage and update Python installations. The `--ignore-non-pypi-packages` flag modifies the command's behavior.

            When invoked without flags, `brew update-python-versions` will upgrade all available Python versions in your system to their latest releases. However, with the `--ignore-non-pypi-packages` flag, this command will only update packages installed from PyPI (Python Package Index), while leaving other non-Python packages installed unaffected. This allows for fine-grained control over which packages are updated in your Python environments.
        package-name: '[AI] The `brew update-python-resources` command is a Homebrew (a popular package manager for macOS) utility used to manage and update Python installation''s resources, such as packages and modules, that are stored outside the standard library. The `--package-name` option specifies the name of a particular Python package, which will be updated or installed if not already present. This command helps ensure your Python environment remains up-to-date with the latest resources.'
        print-only: '[AI] The `brew update-python-resources --print-only` command is used with Homebrew, a package manager for macOS, to check for available updates to Python''s installed resources (such as packages and headers) without actually installing the new versions. This can help users stay informed about available updates before deciding to apply them.'
        quiet: '[AI] `brew update-python-resources` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command is responsible for updating Python''s resources and installing any missing dependencies, ensuring the system has the latest packages required to run Python applications. The `--quiet` option suppresses informational output during the execution of this command. In summary, `brew update-python-resources --quiet` updates Python resources in quiet mode, meaning it runs without displaying progress messages or other non-error output.'
        silent: '[AI] `brew update-python-resources --silent` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to update Python''s installed resources and packages silently. This means that no output or confirmation prompts will be displayed during the process. This command ensures that the latest versions of necessary files, such as locales and data, are available for your Python installation.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew update-python-resources` is a command provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to update Python''s built-in packages and resources. The `--verbose` option increases the output of the command to show more detailed information about the updating process. In essence, it ensures that you have the latest Python packages while providing real-time feedback on the progress.'
        version: '[AI] `brew update-python-resources` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command, `--version`, is used to check for and install updated Python packages and their associated resources. The `update` part of the command tells Homebrew to look for newer versions available in its repositories, and `python-resources` refers to additional system files that may be needed for some Python packages to function correctly. By running this command, users can ensure they have the latest Python resources installed.'
