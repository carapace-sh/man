documentation:
    command: '[AI] "swaynag" is a command used in the Sway window manager for the Linux operating system. It stands for "Sway Nested Application Groups" and is used to create and manage application groups within the Sway workspace. These groups allow users to organize related applications into logical collections, making it easier to manage and switch between them using keyboard shortcuts or other gestures. By default, swaynag uses the title of the parent window to name each group. Users can also customize the behavior of these groups through configuration files or commands.'
    flag:
        background: '[AI] The `swaynag --background` command is used in the Sway window manager for i3-wm users. It''s a tool to help convert i3 configuration files to the Sway format. The `--background` option tells swaynag to also convert background images or colors defined in the i3 config file. By using this option, you ensure that your background settings are maintained when converting your i3 config file to a Sway one.'
        border: '[AI] `swaynag` is a tool from the Sway window manager for Wayland. The `--border` option is used to enable or customize the border around windows. With this option, users can set the width, color, and other visual properties of the titlebar and window borders. This can help in creating a visually consistent or personalized desktop environment.'
        border-bottom: '[AI] `swaynag` is a configuration management tool for the tiling window manager, Sway. The option `--border-bottom` is used to enable or disable a border at the bottom of windows. When this flag is passed during the startup of Sway or in the Sway configuration file (known as a `swayconfig`), only the bottom border will be displayed around windows. This can be useful for achieving a specific look and feel or to better differentiate between maximized and non-maximized windows.'
        border-bottom-size: '[AI] `swaynag` is a configuration management tool for the Sway window manager in Linux. The option `--border-bottom-size` sets the size of the bottom border for windows managed by Sway. It takes an argument specifying the pixel value of the border width. For example, `--border-bottom-size 10` would set a 10 pixel wide bottom border for all new windows.'
        button: |-
            [AI] `swaynag` is a utility from the Sway window manager for i3-compatible configurations. The `--button` option is used to define custom button bindings for specific windows or workspace borders in Sway.

            The general syntax for using this option is:

            ```sh
            swaynag --button [WORKSPACE|BORDER|CLIENT] [BUTTON_MASK] [SIGNAL] [COMMAND]
            ```

            Here's a brief explanation of the parameters:

            1. `--button`: This is the flag used to define button bindings.
            2. `[WORKSPACE|BORDER|CLIENT]`: Indicates whether the binding applies to workspaces, borders, or clients. For example, you can use `WORKSPACE` to set a keybinding for switching to a specific workspace, and `BORDER` for defining a button action when hovering over the border of a window.
            3. `[BUTTON_MASK]`: Defines the specific button being bound. This can be any valid X11 button mask, such as `Button1` (left mouse button), `Button2` (middle mouse button), or `Button3` (right mouse button).
            4. `[SIGNAL]`: The signal that triggers the command when the button is pressed or released. Common signals are `button_press_event`, `button_release_event`, and `motion_notify_event`.
            5. `[COMMAND]`: The command to be executed when the signal is triggered. This can be any valid Sway command, such as a script, a window manipulation command, or an external program.
        button-background: '[AI] The `--button-background` option in the SwayWM (Sway) configuration file (e.g., `swaynag`) sets the background color or image for buttons created by the Notification Area ( Nag) plugin. It allows customization of the visual appearance, enabling users to align the theme with their desktop environment.'
        button-border-size: '[AI] `swaynag` is a configuration management tool for the i3wm window manager in the Sway compositor for Linux. The `--button-border-size` option sets the size of the border around buttons on the bar in pixels. This can be used to adjust the appearance and spacing of the buttons on the bar for improved usability or aesthetic preferences.'
        button-dismiss: '[AI] The `swaynag --button-dismiss` command is a feature of Sway, a tiling window manager for Wayland. This command refers to an action where the user clicks on the close button (often represented as an "X" symbol) in the title bar of a window. By using `--button-dismiss`, this action is set to dismiss or hide the window instead of closing it completely. This can be useful for keeping windows minimized or hidden from view while retaining their running state, rather than fully closing them.'
        button-dismiss-gap: '[AI] `swaynag` is a window manager for the Wayland compositor Sway. The `--button-dismiss-gap` option is a configuration setting that specifies the distance, in pixels, between the close button (represented by the "X" symbol) and the edge of a window. This gap helps to prevent accidental window closure when moving or resizing windows near the edge of the screen.'
        button-dismiss-no-terminal: '[AI] The `--button-dismiss-no-terminal` flag for the SwayWM window manager refers to a configuration option that disables showing a terminal window when pressing the dismiss button (usually represented by an "X" mark) on a floating window. This means that clicking the dismiss button will close the window without opening a terminal, allowing for a cleaner and more streamlined user experience.'
        button-gap: '[AI] `swaynag` is a tool for managing Wayland compositor sessions with Sway. The `--button-gap` option sets the horizontal and vertical spacing between window buttons in the titlebar of Sway''s floating or tiled windows. By default, Sway does not have any gap between buttons. Setting this option creates space between them for better accessibility and visual organization.'
        button-margin-right: '[AI] The `--button-margin-right` option in SwayWM (Sway window manager) sets the horizontal margin to the right of a button in the titlebar of a window. It takes an argument representing the size of the margin, usually given in pixels. For example, `--button-margin-right 10` sets the right margin for all buttons to be 10 pixels wide.'
        button-no-terminal: |-
            [AI] `swaynag` is a utility for managing Wayland compositor sessions with Sway. The `--button-no-terminal` flag is an option that can be passed to the `swaynag run` command.

            This flag instructs `swaynag` not to open a terminal window when a button event (such as a mouse click) is detected on a floating or tiled workspace in Sway. This can be useful if you prefer to manually open terminals or if you have other terminal emulator programs running that you want to use instead.
        button-padding: '[AI] `swaynag` is a utility used in the i3wm window manager for generating and managing window layouts, or "nags." The `--button-padding` option modifies the spacing between buttons in created window layouts. It takes an argument specifying the desired padding size in pixels. For example, `swaynag generate my_layout --button-padding 10`, would create a new layout named "my\_layout" with a 10 pixel margin around each button.'
        button-text: |-
            [AI] The `--button-text` option in SwayWM's `swayng` command is used to set the text label for a button in the Sway window manager. When creating or modifying a rule file, this option allows users to customize the text that appears on a button when it is defined as a floating or tiled window. For instance, if you have a rule defining a Firefox window and want it to display "Web Browser" as its label, you would use:

            ```
            $rules >> exec --no-start firefox <args> \
                --button-text "Web Browser"
            ```
        config: '[AI] `swaynag` is a configuration management tool for the i3wm window manager, written in Haskell. The `--config` option is used to specify the path to the Sway configuration file when initializing or managing Sway sessions. For example, `swaynag init --config /path/to/your/config.hs` will create a new Sway configuration with the given file path. Other Sway management commands, such as `apply`, `status`, and `restart`, also accept this option to perform their respective actions using the specified configuration file.'
        debug: '[AI] `swaynag` is a configuration management tool for the tiling window manager, Sway. The `--debug` flag is used to enable debug mode when running commands with swaynag. This means that swaynag will provide more detailed output and information during execution, which can be helpful in diagnosing issues or understanding the behavior of complex configurations.'
        detailed-button: '[AI] The `swaynag --detailed-button` command is related to Sway, a tiling window manager for Wayland. This specific command generates a detailed report in the terminal about the current window arrangement and their positions, sizes, titles, and other relevant information. It provides more comprehensive output compared to the regular `swaynag` command, which usually just displays a snapshot of the current window layout.'
        detailed-message: '[AI] `swaynag` is a command-line tool for managing wayland compositing sessions with the Sway window manager. The option `--detailed-message` is used to display more detailed error messages when an error occurs during the execution of a `sway` command. This can be helpful for debugging issues, as it provides more context and information about the nature of the error.'
        details-background: '[AI] `swaynag` is a tool used in the Sway window manager for i3-wm users, providing a more intuitive and user-friendly way to manage workspaces and windows. The command `swaynag --details-background` displays detailed information about each workspace, including its background image or color, position, size, and other settings. This command is useful for inspecting and adjusting the properties of individual workspaces in the Sway window manager.'
        details-border-size: '[AI] The `swaynag` command with the option `--details-border-size` is related to SwayWM, a tiling window manager for Wayland. This option sets the size of borders around the title and other details displayed on the windows managed by SwayWM. By default, this border size is usually small, but using this command allows adjusting it to preferred values for better visual organization and distinction between windows.'
        dismiss-button: '[AI] The `--dismiss-button` flag for the SwayWM window manager is used to disable or enable the close button (represented as an "X" mark) on windows. When set, it hides the dismiss button and keeps the window open until explicitly closed by other means such as using the titlebar menu or a keyboard shortcut. If not set, the dismiss button is visible and functional. This flag provides customization options for users based on their preferences.'
        edge: '[AI] `swaynag --edge` is a command used in the Sway window manager for Wayland. It updates the Sway configuration and applies changes using the latest development code from the edge branch of the Sway repository, ensuring that users have the most recent features and bug fixes.
