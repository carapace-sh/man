documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `ping` command is a network diagnostic tool used to test the reachability and responsiveness of a particular host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It sends packets of data, known as ICMP echo requests, to the target host and measures the round-trip time for the responses. By examining the replies, `ping` can determine if the host is accessible, how long it takes for data to travel between hosts, and identify any packet loss or latency issues.'
    flag:
        "4": '[AI] The `ping` command with the `-4` option is used for performing a IPv4 specific ping test in Unix or Linux environments. It sends Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo requests to a specified IPv4 address to check if it''s reachable and responsive, while providing more detailed output related to IPv4 addresses and interface information compared to the generic `ping` command without any options.'
        "6": '[AI] `ping -6` is a command used in Unix or Unix-like operating systems for testing the reachability and responsiveness of IPv6 hosts. The `-6` option specifies that IPv6 protocol should be used instead of IPv4, which is the default protocol when no address family is specified. This command sends ICMPv6 Echo Request packets to the target host and waits for ICMPv6 Echo Reply messages in response. If the target responds, the command reports the round-trip time and packet loss rate. If not, it indicates that the host could not be reached.'
        A: '[AI] `ping -A` is a command used in Unix-based systems to perform a reverse DNS lookup of each IP address returned by a ping operation. The `-A` option stands for "Addresses and hostnames" and it displays both the IP addresses and their corresponding hostnames (if available) as they respond to the ping request. This can be useful when you want to check the DNS records associated with an IP address.'
        B: '[AI] The `ping` command with the `-B` option is used to send a single packet instead of the default series of packets, as in continuous ping. This option is useful for certain diagnostic tasks where you want to send only one packet and receive its reply instead of the usual echoes of multiple packets.'
        D: '[AI] The `ping` command with the `-D` option is used for setting the Don''t Fragment flag in the IP packet being sent. This means that the packets cannot be fragmented at any point during transmission, which can help ensure that larger packets are transmitted without being split into smaller pieces. This option is particularly useful when testing network paths with large packets or over networks that may have fragmentation issues.'
        F: '[AI] The `-F` flag used with the `ping` command in Unix-based systems changes the ICMP echo request packet format from the default Type 8 (Echo Request) to Type 252 (Format Message). This allows sending custom data as the first few bytes of the ICMP packet, which is used for the ping reply. The flag is typically used in network testing and troubleshooting for specific scenarios where this type of packet manipulation might be required.'
        I: '[AI] The `ping -I` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to specify the outgoing interface for ICMP echo requests when using the ping utility. By providing an interface name or IP address as an argument, you can force `ping` to send packets from that particular interface instead of the default one. For example: `ping -I eth0 8.8.8.8`.'
        L: '[AI] The `ping` command with the `-L` option is used to test the connectivity and latency of a network host by sending a large packet instead of the standard ICMP echo request. This can be useful when ICMP packets are being filtered or when working with non-IPv4 protocols like IPv6, as it allows specifying a custom packet size up to 65535 bytes with the argument `-s`. The option `-L` itself does not directly control the size of the packet but is often used in conjunction with other options such as `-f` or `-p` for setting packet format and data.'
        M: '[AI] The `-M` option in the `ping` command is used to specify the type of packet to send for more advanced tests, such as testing the ability of a host to fragment packets (`-Mfrag`) or sending timestamps (`-Ms`). Other options include `-MM`, which sends both fragment and timestamp messages, and `-Mdo`, which sends an ICMP destination unreachable message.'
        O: '[AI] The `ping -O` option is used with the `ping` command in networking. It stands for "Source Quench" or "Selective ACKnowledgment (SACK) Option." This option enables the sending of IP packets with the Source Quench flag set, which is used to signal congestion in the network and ask the receiver to reduce its data transmission rate. The aim is to prevent packet loss due to network congestion and improve overall network performance.'
        Q: '[AI] The `ping` command with the `-q` option is used to send a single packet to a specified host or address instead of the default behavior which is sending multiple packets and displaying statistics about packet loss, response time, etc. The syntax is typically `ping -q <count> <destination>`, where `<count>` is set to 1 for sending a single packet. For example, `ping -q 1 8.8.8.8` sends a single packet to the Google Public DNS server.'
        R: '[AI] The `-R` option in the `ping` command is used for reversing the address replying to queries. Instead of sending ICMP Echo Request packets to a specified host and receiving ICMP Echo Reply packets in response, this option makes the local machine send ICMP Echo Reply packets to the source address from which it received an ICMP packet. This can be useful for identifying the host behind a NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway or firewall.'
        S: '[AI] The `-S` option in the `ping` command is used to specify the source IP address from which packets are sent. By default, the source address is taken from the local machine''s interface. This option allows you to perform a ping test from a specified IP address instead of the default one.'
        T: '[AI] The `ping` command with the `-T` option sets the ping packet timing template. It specifies the time in seconds between each packet being sent, and the time allowed for each reply to be received before considering that packet lost. For example, `ping -T 1s 192.168.1.1` sends packets every second to the IP address 192.168.1.1. This option allows customizing ping operation timing for specific use cases.'
        U: '[AI] The `ping` command with the `-U` flag is used for ICMP Echo-reply scan in Unix or Linux systems. Instead of using standard ICMP Echo requests, it sends IP Protocol Type 11 (ICMP Echo-request for Subnet Discovery) messages. This scan type is often used to detect open routers and firewalls, as they typically respond to these types of messages with an ICMP Error message or ICMP Net Unreachable message, respectively. It''s important to note that using such scans without proper authorization may be against the policy or even illegal in certain networks.'
        V: '[AI] The `ping -V` command is used with the Ping utility in Unix or Linux systems to display version information about the ping application itself, not the target being pinged. This command provides details such as the version number, operating system, and other relevant information about the ping utility. It helps in identifying the specific version of the ping tool that is being used for troubleshooting or compatibility purposes.'
        W: '[AI] The `-W` option in the `ping` command sets the timeout interval for waiting for each reply. If a packet sent by the ping command does not receive a response within the specified time, it is considered lost and the ping command reports it as such. By default, there is no timeout set, meaning that the ping command will wait indefinitely for a reply. Using `-W` followed by a number specifies the timeout in units of hundredths of a second (for example, `-W 500` sets a timeout of 500 milliseconds or 0.5 seconds).'
        a: '[AI] `ping -a` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems, including Windows with its WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) feature. This command is used to perform a reverse DNS lookup on each address returned by the ping utility. In simpler terms, it resolves IP addresses to their corresponding hostnames. The `-a` flag stands for "Address and hostname" and displays both the IP address and the corresponding hostname in the output.'
        b: '[AI] The `ping` command with the option `-b` (or `--packet-size`) sets the size of each individual packet sent during a ping test. This option allows you to specify the number of data bytes in each packet. It is typically used for testing network conditions with large packets, such as those used in multimedia streaming or other applications where large amounts of data are being transmitted.'
        c: '[AI] The `ping` command with the option `-c` specifies the number of packets to send. For example, `ping -c 5 example.com` sends five ICMP Echo Request packets to the specified host and displays the response for each packet, including the round-trip time and packet loss percentage.'
        d: '[AI] The `ping` command with the `-d` option is used to send a specified number of packets instead of the default which is 4. This can be useful for testing network connectivity over an extended period or for specific troubleshooting purposes where more than the usual four packets are required. For example, you might use `ping -d 100` to send 100 packets to a host in order to gather more data about network performance or reliability.'
        f: '[AI] The `ping -f` command is used in Unix-like operating systems to send continuous ICMP echo requests, also known as "pings," without waiting for responses. The "-f" option stands for "loop," indicating that the ping process should continue sending packets indefinitely until it''s manually stopped or terminated. This can be useful for diagnostic tests on network configurations and latency measurements but is often discouraged due to potential network congestion and misinterpreted as a denial-of-service attack.'
        h: '[AI] The `ping` command with the option `-h` or `--help` displays the help message, providing information about how to use the `ping` utility effectively. This includes details on various options and their functions, as well as syntax examples.'
        i: '[AI] The `ping` command with the option `-i` or `--interleave` specifies the number of interleaved ICMP echo requests to send. In simpler terms, it sets the number of ping packets sent at once between two echo messages from the same source to the same destination. This can be useful for reducing network traffic when sending a large number of pings, as it sends fewer packets in each burst.'
        l: '[AI] The `ping` command with the `-l` option sets the size of each data packet sent. For example, `ping -l 64 <target>` specifies that each data packet transmitted contains 64 bytes. This option can be used for testing network configurations where specific packet sizes are required.'
        m: '[AI] The `-m` option in the `ping` command is used to specify the size of each data packet sent. It takes an argument which represents the packet size in bytes. For example, `ping -m 64` will send packets of 64 bytes each. This option can be useful for testing network performance and checking if larger packets are being properly transmitted.'
        "n": '[AI] The `ping` command with the option `-n` specifies the number of packets to send. For example, `ping -n 5 <target>` will send five packets to the specified `<target>` and display the response from each packet.'
        p: '[AI] The `ping -p` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to send custom packets instead of the default ICMP echo request packet when using the ping utility. The `-p` option followed by the hexadecimal value specifies the type and code of the packet to be sent. For instance, `ping -p 0x8006` sends an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request packet. This option is often used for network diagnosis and troubleshooting.'
        q: '[AI] `ping -q` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems, specifically the `ping` utility. The `-q` option stands for "quiet" or "query mode." When using this option, the output of the `ping` command is limited to displaying only the replies received from the target host and their corresponding round-trip times (RTTs). Error messages, statistics, and other unnecessary information are suppressed. This is useful when performing automated tests or scripts where detailed output may not be required.'
        s: |-
            [AI] The `ping -s` command is not a standard option for the `ping` utility in Unix or Linux systems. However, some network stack implementations or custom ping versions might support it.

            The `-s` (or `--send-buf`) option when available sets the size of the data packet sent with each `ping` request. It overrides the default packet size of 64 bytes and allows specifying a larger packet size, up to the system's maximum transmission unit (MTU). This can be useful for testing network paths that might have MTUs smaller than the typical defaults or for diagnosing specific network issues related to large packets.
        t: '[AI] The `ping -t` command is a utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems used to test the reachability of a network host or an interface by sending it packets and measuring the round-trip time. The `-t` option sets the timeout interval for waiting for each reply. Unlike the default behavior where ping sends one packet and waits for a response before sending the next, with `ping -t`, ping continues to send packets at the specified interval until it is manually stopped or an error occurs. This can be useful when troubleshooting network connectivity issues or monitoring network performance.'
        v: '[AI] The `ping -v` command is used in Unix-based systems to perform a more verbose ping test. With this option, ping will display more detailed information about each packet sent and received, including the packet size, timestamp, and statistical data like packet loss percentage and round-trip time. It''s useful for troubleshooting network issues or when you need a more detailed output from the ping command.'
        w: '[AI] The `-w` option in the `ping` command sets the timeout interval for waiting for each reply. If a packet does not arrive within this time, it is considered lost and reported as such. The argument to `-w` specifies the timeout in milliseconds. For example, `ping -w 500 hostname` sets the timeout to 500 milliseconds (or 0.5 seconds).'
