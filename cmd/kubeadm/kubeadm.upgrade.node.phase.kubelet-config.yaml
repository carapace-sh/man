description: Upgrade the kubelet configuration for this node
flags:
    --dry-run: Do not change any state, just output the actions that would be performed.
    --kubeconfig=: The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster. If the flag is not set, a set of standard locations can be searched for an existing kubeconfig file.

    command: |-
        [AI] The `kubeadm upgrade node` command is used to perform an upgrade of a Kubernetes cluster, specifically on a worker node. The `phase kubelet-config` argument refers to the stage in the node upgrade process where the new Kubelet configuration is applied.

        During this phase, `kubeadm` updates the systemd or initd service for Kubelet with the latest version and applies the new Kubelet configuration. This ensures that the worker node is ready to run containers using the updated Kubernetes components post-upgrade.
    flag:
        dry-run: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm upgrade node` is a command used to perform an in-place Kubernetes cluster upgrade using `kubeadm`. The `--phase kubelet-config` option specifies that only the `kubelet-config` phase of the upgrade process should be simulated or tested with the `--dry-run` flag.

            In this context, "kubelet-config" refers to configuring the node's `kubelet` component to work with the new version of Kubernetes being installed. The `--dry-run` flag causes `kubeadm` to display what it would do during the upgrade process without actually making any changes to the system. This is useful for testing and validating the intended configuration before applying the changes in a production environment.
        kubeconfig: '[AI] `kubeadm upgrade node` is a command used to perform an in-place Kubernetes cluster upgrade using `kubeadm`. The `phase kubelet-config` argument specifies that this particular upgrade step is dedicated to configuring the `kubelet` daemon on the node. The `--kubeconfig` flag indicates that a specific `kubeconfig` file should be used during this phase, allowing for fine-grained control over the connection details between the node and other components in the cluster. In summary, `kubeadm upgrade node phase kubelet-config --kubeconfig` is responsible for updating the `kubelet` configuration on a node as part of a Kubernetes cluster upgrade while specifying a custom `kubeconfig` file for connection purposes.'
