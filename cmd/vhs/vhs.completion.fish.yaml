        [AI] The `vhs completion fish` command is not a standard or well-known command in Unix-like operating systems, including Fish Shell. It appears to be a typo or misunderstanding of the `fish-compile` or `vim-completion` Fish Shell functions.

        `fish-compile` is used for compiling Fish Shell code, and it doesn't provide any completion functionality. As for `vim-completion`, it is an external plugin that enables Vi-style completions in the Fish Shell, but it needs to be installed separately and is invoked using `enable vim`.

        Therefore, there seems to be no valid command named "`vhs completion fish`". If you meant to use one of the existing completion methods or functions provided by Fish Shell, make sure to check their correct names and usage.

        no-descriptions: |-
            [AI] The `vhs completion fish` command is a part of the Fish Shell's (fish) autocompletion feature. It suggests completions based on the context of your command line input.

            The option `--no-descriptions` instructs the autocompleter to not display descriptions or tooltips alongside completion suggestions in the dropdown menu. This can be useful for reducing visual clutter or improving performance if descriptions are computationally expensive to generate.
