documentation:
    command: '[AI] `cargo search` is a Cargo command used to find crates (packages) in the Crate Registry based on their name or keywords in their documentation. It returns a list of matching crates along with a brief description for each, helping users discover and choose appropriate dependencies for their Rust projects.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `cargo search --help` is a command used in Rust programming language''s Cargo build tool. This command displays detailed help information about the `cargo search` sub-command. It allows users to search for crates (Rust packages) in the Crate Registry based on keywords or names, with various options to filter and sort the results. Users can run this command in their terminal to understand how to use this functionality effectively.'
        index: '[AI] `cargo search --index` is a command used in Rust programming language''s Cargo build tool. It searches the Crates.io registry, which is the default registry for Rust crates, looking for packages that match a given keyword or name. The `--index` flag instructs Cargo to only look at the registry''s metadata and not download or build anything. This is useful when you want to quickly find out if a specific package exists, without incurring the time and network usage associated with building the package.'
        limit: '[AI] `cargo search` is a command-line tool for searching crates (libraries or packages) in the Rust Package Registry. The `--limit` flag limits the number of results returned by the search command. By default, it returns up to 10 results. Using `--limit N`, where N is an integer, will return only the first N results.'
        quiet: '[AI] `cargo search --quiet` is a command used in Rust programming language''s Cargo build tool. It performs a search for crates (libraries or packages) in the registry based on the given keyword without displaying any output on the terminal, making it suitable for automated background tasks.'
        registry: '[AI] `cargo search` is a command-line tool provided by Rust''s package manager, Cargo. The `--registry` flag is used to limit the scope of a package search to only those packages that are officially published on the Crates.io registry, which is the default registry for Cargo. By using this flag, developers can ensure they find and install trusted and verified packages while avoiding potential security risks from unverified sources.'
