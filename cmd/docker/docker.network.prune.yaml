description: Remove all unused networks
flags:
    --filter=: Provide filter values (e.g. "until=<timestamp>")
    -f, --force: Do not prompt for confirmation
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker network prune` is a command used to remove unused and dangling networks in Docker. When you create and connect containers, Docker automatically creates networks for them. Over time, unused networks can accumulate, taking up disk space. The `prune` command helps manage these networks by removing any that are not being used by running or dangling containers. This results in a cleaner Docker network setup and saves disk space.'
    flag:
        filter: '[AI] The `docker network prune --filter` command is used to remove unused and dangling networks in Docker. The `--filter` option allows you to apply filters to select specific networks for removal. For example, `docker network prune --filter name=my-network` will only remove the network named "my-network" if it is unused or dangling. By default, Docker will ask for confirmation before removing each network. To force removal without confirmation, add the `--force` option.'
        force: '[AI] `docker network prune --force` is a command used to remove abandoned and unused Docker networks in a Docker environment. The `--force` option forces the removal of networks even if they have attached containers, ensuring that all connected containers are also terminated. This command helps keep your network configuration clean and efficient by eliminating unneeded networks and their associated resources.'
