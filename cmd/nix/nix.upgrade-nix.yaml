documentation:
    command: '[AI] `nix upgrade-nix` is a Nix package manager command used to upgrade the Nix package manager installation itself to the latest version. This command downloads, verifies, compiles (if necessary), and installs the new version of Nix. Running this command keeps your Nix environment up-to-date with the latest features and improvements.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `nix upgrade-nix --debug` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command initiates an upgraded process for Nix itself from the current installation to the latest available version. The `--debug` flag enables debug mode during the upgrade process, providing more detailed output and information for troubleshooting purposes.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `nix upgrade --dry-run` is a Nix package manager command used to simulate an upgrade of installed packages without actually performing the upgrade. The `--dry-run` option shows what would be done if you ran the command without this flag, including which packages will be upgraded and their new versions. It helps in evaluating the effects of the upgrade before applying the changes in a production environment.'
        log-format: '[AI] `nix upgrade` is a command provided by Nix Package Manager to update the installation of Nix and its packages. The `--log-format` option specifies the format of the log output generated during the upgrade process. By default, Nix generates a verbose log with timestamps and detailed information about each action performed during the upgrade. However, you can customize the log format using this option. For example, `nix upgrade --log-format="%{item} %{size}/%{percentage}%%"` will display logs with the name of the package being upgraded, its size, and progress percentage.'
        nix-store-paths-url: '[AI] `nix upgrade-nix` is a Nix OS command used to update the Nix package manager installation, bringing in new package versions and system configurations. The `--nix-store-paths-url` option specifies URLs from which to fetch additional Nix store paths during the upgrade process. These paths can be used to access custom or external packages that are not available in the default Nix channels. This flag allows expanding the scope of package upgrades beyond the standard offerings.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] `nix upgrade` is a command from the Nix Package Manager to install or update Nix and its packages. The option `--print-build-logs` instructs it to display the build logs of the upgraded packages, which can help diagnose potential issues during the upgrade process. In essence, it provides more detailed information about what is being built and any errors that may occur.'
        profile: '[AI] The command `nix-upgrade --profile` is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems, to perform an in-place upgrade of the Nix installation to the latest version. The `--profile` option specifies which user profile to use during the upgrade process. By default, it upgrades the current system user''s profile, but you can also specify a different user or a global profile if needed. This command installs new versions of packages and updates existing ones while keeping your custom configurations.'
        quiet: '[AI] `nix upgrade-nix --quiet` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command is used to upgrade the Nix distribution itself to the latest stable version. The `--quiet` option suppresses informational messages during the upgrade process to provide a quieter experience.'
        verbose: '[AI] `nix upgrade` is a command from Nix Package Manager, which is used to update the Nix expression language and the available packages in your Nix channels. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output during the upgrade process, providing more detailed information about the progress and any potential issues that might arise. This can help users troubleshoot any problems and better understand what''s happening behind the scenes.'
