        [AI] `nmcli device modify` is a command used in NetworkManager, a system service for managing network connections in Linux. This command allows you to modify the state or properties of a network interface. The basic syntax is:

        ```bash
        nmcli device modify <DEVICE> [SET|CHANGE] <PROPERTY=VALUE> ...
        ```

        Replace `<DEVICE>` with the name or index of the desired network interface, and `<PROPERTY>` with the network property you wish to modify (e.g., "ifname", "state", "connection", etc.), followed by the new value `<VALUE>`. Use `SET` if the device does not already have the property, and `CHANGE` if it already does. For example:

        ```bash
        nmcli device modify eth0 connection.autoconnect yes
        ```

        This command sets the autoconnect property of the Ethernet interface 'eth0' to 'yes'.
