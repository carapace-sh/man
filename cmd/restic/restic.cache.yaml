description: Operate on local cache directories
flags:
    --cleanup: remove old cache directories
    --max-age=: max age in `days` for cache directories to be considered old
    --no-size: do not output the size of the cache directories
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `restic cache` command in Restic, a backup program, is used to manage the caching of data for incremental backups. It allows you to create, list, and remove caches, which are temporary storage locations where differences between snapshots are stored before being sent to the final backup destination. By using caches, Restic can efficiently perform incremental backups with minimal network traffic.'
    flag:
        cleanup: '[AI] `restic cache --cleanup` is a command used in the data backup and sync tool, `restic`. This command is used to remove old cache files that are no longer needed for backup versions. The cache is a local storage area where restic stores metadata about the backups, such as file checksums and compression information. By running `--cleanup`, restic removes any cache files older than the configured retention period or those that are no longer required due to deleted or renamed files in the source directory. This helps keep the local cache size under control while still maintaining the necessary backup metadata.'
        max-age: '[AI] The `--max-age` option in the `restic cache` command is used to set a maximum age for cached objects. When this option is specified with a valid duration value (e.g., "1h" or "2d"), restic will only serve cached objects that are younger than the specified duration. This can help ensure that data being served from the cache is as up-to-date as possible, reducing the risk of serving stale data. If no `--max-age` option is provided, there is no expiration set on the cache.'
        no-size: '[AI] The `restic cache --no-size` command is used in the data backup tool, Restic. This command instructs Restic to create or manage a cache without calculating and storing file sizes of backed up data. By using `--no-size`, Restic only stores checksums of files instead of checksums and file sizes. This can save storage space and reduce I/O during the backup process, especially when dealing with large files or many backups.'
