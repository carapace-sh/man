    command: '[AI] The `gh release delete-asset` command is used to delete an asset associated with a specific GitHub Release in the GitHub CLI (gh). It requires providing the release ID or tag name and the asset filename as arguments. For instance, `gh release delete-asset <release> <asset-filename>`, where `<release>` can be either the release ID or tag name, and `<asset-filename>` is the name of the file to be deleted from that release.'
    flag:
        "yes": '[AI] The `gh release delete-asset` is a command used in the GitHub CLI (gh) for managing GitHub releases. This specific command with the `--yes` flag is used to forcefully delete an asset from a release. Without the `--yes` flag, you would be prompted for confirmation before deleting each asset separately. With the `--yes` flag, the confirmation step is skipped and the assets will be deleted without further interaction.'
