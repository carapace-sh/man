    command: '[AI] `apt-cache` is a part of Apt, a package management system used by Debian and Ubuntu distributions. The `pkgnames` command is used to search for packages in the local package cache and displays a list of their names. It does not install or update packages, but only provides information about what packages are available based on the given search term. This can be useful when trying to remember the name of a package or when looking for related packages.'
