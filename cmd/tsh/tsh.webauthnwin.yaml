        [AI] The `tsh webauthnwin` command is not a standard Windows or Unix command, but rather a custom command specific to the Tenable Security Center's Tenable Scan Engine (TSH) tool. This command is used for configuring and managing WebAuthn (FIDO2) scans on the Windows platform within Tenable Scan.

        WebAuthn, or FIDO2 (Fast Identity Online 2), is a decentralized standard for passwordless authentication that provides stronger security through the use of public key cryptography and biometric information. With this command, an administrator can enable, configure, and scan for WebAuthn implementations on Windows systems as part of their vulnerability assessment or penetration testing efforts using Tenable Scan.
