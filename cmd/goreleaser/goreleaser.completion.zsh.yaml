    command: '[AI] `goreleaser completion zsh` is a command used to install Zsh completions for `goreleaser`, a tool for packaging and releasing Go projects. When you run this command in your terminal, it downloads and sets up the completion files in your `$ZSH_DATA_DIR/completions/_` directory, allowing for more convenient and accurate tab-completion of `goreleaser` subcommands and options while using Zsh as your shell.'
    flag:
        no-descriptions: '[AI] `goreleaser completion zsh --no-descriptions` is a command used to install completion for `goreleaser`, a tool for managing the release process for Go projects, in Zsh shell. The `--no-descriptions` flag indicates that the installation should not include descriptions or help messages with each completion suggestion, which can make the autocomplete function faster and more lightweight.'
