description: pair with a device for secure TCP/IP communication
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `adb pair` command is not a valid Android Debug Bridge (ADB) command. ADB is a versatile command-line tool that allows developers to communicate with and manage an Android device. It includes various sub-commands, such as `adb shell`, `adb reboot`, or `adb install`, but there''s no recognized `pair` command in ADB. To pair devices, you might be referring to Bluetooth pairing, which is an entirely different process and doesn''t involve using the Android Debug Bridge.'
