documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant up` command is used to initialize and provision a Vagrant project. It brings up the virtual machine (VM) associated with the current directory, ensuring it is in a running state. This process includes setting up the VM''s environment using any specified configuration files, and then applying provisioning scripts or tasks defined in the `Vagrantfile`. Essentially, this command sets up the environment for your project inside the VM, making it ready for development or testing.'
    flag:
        destroy-on-error: |-
            [AI] `vagrant up --destroy-on-error` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual development environments. The `up` command brings up a Vagrant box, which is a preconfigured virtual machine or container.

            The `--destroy-on-error` flag specifies that if any provisioning or synching error occurs during the process, Vagrant should destroy and remove the box instead of leaving it in an inconsistent state. This is useful for ensuring that your environment starts from a known good state each time you use it, by cleaning up any errors and starting fresh.
        install-provider: |-
            [AI] The `vagrant up --install-provider` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments, to install or update a specific provider in your Vagrantfile. A provider in Vagrant is a plugin that manages the interaction between Vagrant and the underlying infrastructure, such as VirtualBox, VMware, or AWS.

            When you run `vagrant up --install-provider <provider_name>`, Vagrant checks for available versions of the specified provider, downloads the latest version if available, and installs it locally. If you have previously installed a specific version, this command will update it to the latest available version. This ensures that your Vagrant environments are using the latest features and bug fixes from the provider.
        no-destroy-on-error: '[AI] `vagrant up --no-destroy-on-error` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command initiates the provisioning and startup of a Vagrant box (a preconfigured virtual environment), but with the added flag `--no-destroy-on-error`, it prevents Vagrant from destroying and recreating the box if an error occurs during the process. Instead, Vagrant will attempt to fix the issue and continue provisioning the existing box. This can be helpful when working on complex configurations or when errors might have simple solutions.'
        no-install-provider: |-
            [AI] The command `vagrant up --no-install-provider` is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual environments, to bring up a Vagrant box without installing or updating the provider.

            When you run `vagrant up`, Vagrant attempts to ensure that your Vagrant environment matches the specified configuration by bringing up or destroying virtual machines, provisioning them with files and scripts, and installing software using the installed providers.

            The `--no-install-provider` flag overrides this behavior and tells Vagrant not to install or update the provider for the box you're working with. This can be useful if you want to use an existing provider installation or if you encounter issues during installation.

            In summary, running `vagrant up --no-install-provider` will start up your virtual environment without attempting to install or update the provider.
        no-parallel: |-
            [AI] `vagrant up --no-parallel` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. The `up` command brings up a Vagrant environment by provisioning the VirtualBox or other supported VM with specified configurations.

            The `--no-parallel` option disables parallel execution of provisions, meaning that Vagrant will provision each VM sequentially rather than concurrently. This can be useful when dealing with limited resources or complex provisioning tasks where it's essential to ensure each step completes before moving on to the next.
        no-provision: '[AI] The `vagrant up --no-provision` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments, to bring up a specific vagrant box without executing any provisioning scripts or tasks. Provisioning refers to the configuration management of the guest operating system using files located in the `Vagrantfile` or external provisioning tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet. By adding the `--no-provision` flag, Vagrant will only provision the box with an IP address and SSH key, skipping any additional configuration management steps defined in the `Vagrantfile`.'
        parallel: '[AI] `vagrant up --parallel` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command starts up all available Vagrant machines in parallel mode, meaning multiple machines can be provisioned and brought up at the same time instead of one after another. It''s useful when working with larger projects that involve many VMs, as it reduces overall build time.'
        provider: '[AI] `Vagrant up --provider` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual environments. This command initializes or configures a Vagrant project by bringing up the specified VM(s) using the specified provider. A provider is a component that enables Vagrant to interact with a particular type of infrastructure, such as VirtualBox or VMware. When you run `vagrant up --provider`, Vagrant checks if the VM already exists and is running, then installs any necessary software or provisions the VM according to the configured `Vagrantfile`. The main goal is to prepare the environment for development by bringing up the VM with the specified provider.'
        provision: '[AI] `vagrant up --provision` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machines. The `up` command brings up a Vagrant environment by initializing, provisioning, and starting the VM. With the `--provision` flag, it specifically focuses on running the provisioners, which are scripts or configurations that modify the VM after it''s been brought up to ensure the desired system state is achieved. Provisioners can include things like installing software packages, managing files, or setting environment variables.'
        provision-with: '[AI] `vagrant up --provision-with` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. The `up` command starts or restarts a Vagrant machine based on its defined configuration. The `--provision-with` option specifies the provisioner to use for automatic provisioning, which is the process of installing software, configuring settings, or updating the guest system after it has been booted up. Commonly used provisioners include Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Shell Script, and Fabric. This command ensures that the specified provisioner runs during machine provisioning to automate configuration management tasks.'
