        existing: '[AI] The `hexchat --existing` command is used in HexChat, an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client. This command line argument instructs HexChat to open a connection to an existing server and channel without asking for the server or channel details each time it starts up.

The user can still interact with the IM client through the tray icon and receive notifications without having to bring the window back into focus manually. This option can be useful for those who prefer to keep their desktop clutter-free or have limited screen real estate.'
        no-auto: '[AI] `hexchat --no-auto` is a command-line argument for HexChat, an instant messaging client. The `--no-auto` option disables automatic joining of channels at startup.
