documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `xdotool` command with the argument `windowmap` is used to display a list of open windows in the terminal, along with their titles and IDs. It is part of the `xdotool` suite, which provides a way to interact with the X Window System graphically via the command line. By invoking `xdotool windowmap`, you can quickly access information about currently active windows for scripting or automation purposes.'
    flag:
        sync: |-
            [AI] `xdotool windowmap --sync` is a command-line utility used in Linux and Unix systems for interacting with graphical user interface (GUI) elements using the X11 protocol. Specifically, this command is used to list all open windows with their titles and IDs, and wait for a response before returning control back to the terminal.

            The `--sync` option ensures that the operation blocks the script execution until all requested window information has been returned. Without this option, the utility would continue executing the next command in the script while still waiting for window information.

            The `windowmap` subcommand lists the title and ID of each open window. Combined with `--sync`, it provides a convenient way to locate specific windows based on their titles or IDs within a script, making it useful for automating various GUI tasks in an efficient manner.
