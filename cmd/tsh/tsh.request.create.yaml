documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tsh request create` command is used in Tenable''s SecurityCenter Continuous View (CV) platform to create a new scan or assessment request. It doesn''t directly execute a scan, but sets up the necessary configuration and parameters for a future scan. After creating the request, it can be scheduled to run automatically at a later time. The syntax is typically `tsh request create <request_name> [<platform>] [-c <config_file>] [<options>]`. Here, `<request_name>` specifies the name of the new scan or assessment, `<platform>` identifies the target systems or networks (optional), `<config_file>` points to a custom configuration file for advanced settings, and `<options>` include various parameters to customize the scan or assessment. For example, you can specify the vulnerability database to use, the plugins to run, the credentials to authenticate with, or the scanning method (active or passive).'
    flag:
        no-nowait: '[AI] The `tsh request create --no-nowait` command is used in Terraform State handling with the Consul Template plugin (Terraform plugin for managing Consul configuration). This command creates a new resource request in the Consul template, but does not wait for it to be applied. In other words, it returns immediately after requesting the creation of the resource without blocking until the resource is actually created or applied in the Consul configuration. This can be useful when creating multiple resources concurrently and you don''t need to wait for each one to finish before moving on to the next task.'
        nowait: '[AI] The `tsh request create --nowait` command is used in Tenable Security Center''s Tenable Security Half (TSH) to submit a new scanning or task request without waiting for a confirmation message or the completion of the request before continuing with other commands or scripts. This option allows the script or user to move on to other tasks while the background process runs, improving overall efficiency.'
        reason: '[AI] The `tsh request create` command with the `--reason` option is used in Tenable Security Center to create a new vulnerability scanning request. The `--reason` argument specifies the reason or description for the request. This information will be displayed in the Security Center interface and reports, providing context for why the scan was initiated.'
        request-ttl: '[AI] The `tsh request create --request-ttl` command is used in Traffic Server (Tsh) to create a new request with a specified time-to-live (TTL). TTL is the maximum amount of time that the request can be cached by Traffic Server. Setting a shorter TTL allows for more frequent cache updates, while a longer TTL allows for better performance and reduced traffic to origin servers. The `--request-ttl` option sets the TTL value in seconds when creating a new request in Tsh.'
        resource: '[AI] The `tsh request create --resource` command is used in Terraform State Handling (TSH) to create a new resource state in Terraform''s local state file. This command does not provision or modify any infrastructure, but instead updates the desired configuration of the specified resource within Terraform''s understanding. The `--resource` argument specifies the type and name of the resource to be created or updated in the state file.'
        reviewers: '[AI] The `tsh request create --reviewers` command is used in GitLab''s Toplevel Shield (TSH) security tool to create a new security policy request. It allows you to specify one or more reviewers for the request, who will be notified when the request is ready for their approval. This helps ensure that important security decisions are reviewed and approved by the appropriate team members before they''re implemented in your GitLab environment.'
        roles: '[AI] The `tsh request create --roles` command is used in Terraform State Holder (TSH) to create a new resource request with defined roles. TSH is an open-source tool for managing and versioning Terraform state files. This command creates a new request object, which can be reviewed and applied later. The `--roles` flag specifies the list of roles that should be associated with the new resource instance when it is eventually created or updated.'
        session-ttl: '[AI] The `tsh request create --session-ttl` command is used in Traefik, a reverse proxy and load balancer, to create a new transport socket (TS) session with a specific time-to-live (TTL). This TTL sets the maximum duration of the session before it is closed. The longer the TTL, the less frequently new sessions will be created, reducing overhead and improving performance for stable connections. However, shorter TTLs can be useful in situations where session instability is expected or desired, such as in a microservices architecture with frequent session handoffs.'
