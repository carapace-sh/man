documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker-compose ls` is a command used with Docker Compose to list all the defined services and their corresponding containers in a multi-container Docker environment. It does not create or start any containers, but only displays information about them. This command can be useful for quickly checking which services have been defined and which containers are running based on those definitions.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `docker-compose ls --all` is a command used with Docker Compose to list all defined services and their respective networks, both those that are running and those that are stopped or inactive. The `--all` flag includes the inactive services, providing a more comprehensive overview of your defined Docker applications.'
        filter: '[AI] `docker-compose ls --filter` is a command used with Docker Compose to list all defined services and their corresponding containers based on given filters. The `--filter` option allows specifying various conditions to filter the output, such as `name`, `status`, or `service`. For example, using `docker-compose ls --filter name=my_service` would display information only about the service named "my\_service" and its associated containers.'
        format: '[AI] `docker-compose ls --format` is a command used with Docker Compose to list all defined services and their corresponding containers, using a custom output format specified by the `--format` option. This command does not create or start any containers; it only displays information about them based on the definitions in the `docker-compose.yml` file(s) in the current directory. The custom output format can be used to extract specific information, such as service name, container status, network settings, and other metadata.'
        quiet: '[AI] `docker-compose ls --quiet` is a command used with Docker Compose to list all defined services and their corresponding container names in a quiet or minimal output format. This means that only the service name and container name are printed, separated by a space, with each line representing a unique service-container pair. No extra information such as images or status is displayed.'
