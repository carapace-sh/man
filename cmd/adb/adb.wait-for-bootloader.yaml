description: wait for device to be in given state
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `adb wait-for-bootloader` command is used with Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to pause the execution of a script or terminal session until the bootloader mode is detected on an Android device. This command helps ensure that any further ADB commands executed are done so after the device has fully booted into the bootloader mode, reducing the risk of errors or unexpected behavior due to the device being in an inconsistent state during execution.'
