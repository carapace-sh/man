    command: '[AI] The "present" command in natural language processing typically refers to the present tense in verbs, which indicates that an action is currently happening or a fact is true at the moment of speaking. In programming, there might be specific functions or commands named "present" with different meanings depending on the context of the software. However, without more information about the particular system or framework you''re using, it is impossible to give a precise explanation for that command.'
    flag:
        base: '[AI] The `-base` flag is used with the `git checkout` or `git reset` commands in Git version control system. It sets the new commit or checked-out tree to match the current `HEAD` commit, keeping the changes that were staged but not yet committed. Effectively, it resets the working directory and index to match the latest commit while keeping staged changes. This is useful for discarding local modifications without losing staged changes.'
        content: '[AI] The `-present-content` flag is a custom flag used in some scripts or tools, typically in the context of Git or other version control systems. This flag instructs the command to output the difference between the current and the next commit as a patch file containing only the changed content, without the hunk headers and footers. In other words, it presents only the actual differences between the files in a human-readable format, making it easier to review and apply changes manually.'
        help: '[AI] The `-help` option is a common command-line argument used in various programs and scripts to display help or usage information. When you run a command with the `--help` or `-h` (a shorter form of `--help`) option, the program will print out detailed information about how to use that command, including options and their descriptions. The exact format and contents of the output may vary depending on the specific program or language used.'
        http: '[AI] The `-present -http` flag is a command-line option used in OpenSSL, a popular open-source toolkit for SSL/TLS and secure communications. This specific flag configuration sets OpenSSL to present (send) an HTTP response message to the client during a TLS handshake. An HTTP response typically includes the server''s identification (usually through the Server: header), status code, and other metadata. This flag can be used for diagnostic purposes or when customizing the behavior of web servers using OpenSSL as the SSL/TLS library.'
        notes: '[AI] The `-notes` flag is an option used with the `git stash apply` or `git stash pop` commands in Git version control system. It allows you to view or apply a stashed commit''s message along with the changes. When using this flag, the command will display the stash message before applying the changes, giving you a clear understanding of what the changes entail. This is particularly useful when dealing with multiple stashes and wanting to ensure you''re applying the correct one.'
        orighost: '[AI] The "present" flag in Git is used to keep a local branch up-to-date with its corresponding remote branch, ensuring that both branches remain in sync. The term "origin/host" refers to a specific remote repository named "origin", which is often used for upstream repositories in Git workflows. Thus, the flag "present --origin/host" can be interpreted as "keep the local branch in sync with the origin/host remote branch".'
        play: '[AI] The `-play` flag in Git is used with the `git checkout` command to start a new detached HEAD session and display the files in the working directory as if they were being played back from a commit. In other words, it allows you to examine the changes introduced by a specific commit in real-time. The `present` flag is not part of Git''s standard flags for `git checkout`, so its meaning is unclear without additional context.'
        use_playground: '[AI] The `-present -use_playground` flag is a command-line argument used with Swift''s Xcode IDE and Swift Packages for creating app previews or live previews in SwiftUI. This flag enables the use of Playgrounds during SwiftUI testing and development, allowing you to interactively explore and test UI code changes in real time without having to build and run a full application each time.'
