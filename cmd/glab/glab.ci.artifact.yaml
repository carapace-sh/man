documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `glab ci artifact` command is used in GitLab to download the artifacts generated during a specific CI/CD pipeline job. This command is typically run from the terminal or command line interface after the pipeline job has completed successfully. It requires providing the ID or token of the specific pipeline job, followed by the path or name of the desired artifact file(s) for local download. For example: `glab ci get <PIPELINE_ID> <ARTIFACT_PATH>:<LOCAL_PATH>`. This command is useful when you need to access the output files produced during the CI/CD process, such as built binaries, reports, or test results, for further analysis or distribution.'
    flag:
        path: '[AI] The `glab ci artifact --path` command is used in GitLab''s CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) pipeline with the Glab tool. It specifically retrieves the path of an artifact that was previously stored in a GitLab runner''s cache or in an external storage system, like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage. The `--path` flag specifies the relative or absolute path to the particular artifact within the container or runner environment. This command helps you access and use your built artifacts across different stages of your pipeline.'
