documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dart pub global` is a Dart command used to initialize and manage global (project-wide) Dart packages using the Dart package manager, `pub`. It sets up a `pubspec.yaml` file in the root directory of your project, configuring it for global dependencies. When you run this command, Dart will download and install the specified global packages into the `~/.dart/cache/` directory, which can be then accessed by all projects on your system. This setup allows for easier access to commonly-used packages across multiple projects without having to include them individually in each project''s `pubspec.yaml`.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `dart pub global --help` is a command used in Dart programming language to display help information about the `pub global` sub-command of the Dart Pub package manager. This command installs and manages Dart packages globally, meaning that they are available for all projects on your system rather than just those in a specific project directory. The `--help` option is used to show detailed information about how to use this command, including its syntax, available options, and examples.'
