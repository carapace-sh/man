        [AI] `pulumi policy` is a feature in Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform, that helps enforce policies and constraints across your cloud resources managed by Pulumi. The `group` command is used to create or manage groups of policies.

        A policy group is a collection of one or more policies that are applied together to specific resources or stacks. By grouping policies, you can simplify management, apply consistent policies across resources, and enforce complex policy rules. When you create a new policy group, you specify the name and the list of policies that should be included in it. Policies in a group are evaluated together when checking resource compliance. You can also update or delete a policy group as needed.
