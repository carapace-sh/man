    command: '[AI] The `rustup set profile` command is used to switch between Rust compilation profiles managed by Rustup, a Rust toolchain and package manager. Profiles define sets of toolchains with specific Rust compiler and standard library versions for different targets or configurations. By setting a new profile, you can change the active toolchain in your Rust projects accordingly. For instance, `rustup set profile nightly` would set the ''nightly'' profile which includes the latest unstable features of the Rust compiler.'

        help: |-
            [AI] `rustup set profile --help` is a Rust tool command used to configure Rustup, Rust's package manager and version manager, to use a specific Rust target or toolchain profile. The `--help` flag displays detailed help information about this command, explaining its usage and available options:

            * `rustup set profile <NAME>`: Sets the active Rust profile to the specified name.
            * `--help, -h`: Displays this help message and exits.
            * `--list, -l`: Lists all installed Rust profiles and their associated toolchains and targets.
            * `--default, -d <NAME>`: Sets the default profile to be used by Rustup. This is the profile that gets loaded when you don't specify a particular profile name.
            * `--no-modify-paths`: Prevents Rustup from modifying the PATH environment variable when setting or activating a profile. This can be useful if you want to manage your own Rust toolchain paths manually.
        version: '[AI] `rustup set profile --version` is a Rust toolchain management command used to set the active Rust programming language profile to a specific version. The Rust profiling system allows you to manage multiple installations of Rust compilers and tools, each with its own configuration. By specifying a version with this command, you are telling `rustup` to use that particular installation for your projects.'
