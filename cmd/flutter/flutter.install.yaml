documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flutter install` is a command used in Flutter development to download, compile, and install dependencies specified in the project''s `pubspec.yaml` file. This includes both local and remote packages from the Flutter package registry (Flutter packages and Dart packages). Once executed, this command ensures that your Flutter application has all required dependencies up-to-date for a successful build.'
    flag:
        device-timeout: |-
            [AI] `flutter install` is a command used in Flutter development to build and run an application on a specific device or emulator. The `--device-timeout` option sets a timeout for the installation process when running the command on a physical device. If the installation process takes longer than the specified timeout, it will be terminated to prevent potential issues with the device or the development environment.

            For example, if you encounter issues during the installation process due to connectivity problems or other device-related issues, you can increase the timeout to give the process more time to complete by using a higher value, such as `--device-timeout=600` for 10 minutes (600 seconds). The default timeout is usually around 5 minutes (300 seconds). If you're experiencing persistent issues, consider contacting the Flutter community or checking your device and network settings.
        device-user: |-
            [AI] The `flutter install` command is used to build and run a Flutter application. The `--device-user` option specifies that the app should be installed using the given user account on a specific device instead of the default system or guest account. This can be useful when developing an app that requires specific permissions, as these permissions may not be granted to the default accounts on certain devices.

            For example, `flutter install --device-user my_user@my_device:my_app` will install and run your Flutter app using the specified user account (`my_user`) on the device with the label `my_device`.

            This can help ensure that your app functions correctly in a real-world environment with specific user permissions. Note that you'll need to have set up the device for development and have the necessary access credentials beforehand.
        help: '[AI] `flutter install --help` is a command used in the Flutter framework for installing dependencies specified in the `pubspec.yaml` file. The `--help` option is added to display detailed information about this specific Flutter CLI (Command-Line Interface) command. It explains what the command does, how to use it with various options, and provides examples if available.'
        no-uninstall-only: '[AI] The `flutter install` command is used to get dependencies and build or run a Flutter project. The `--no-uninstall-only` option modifies its behavior: instead of only uninstalling packages that are causing issues and keeping the currently installed ones, it installs all required packages from scratch. This can be useful when encountering dependency conflicts or other installation problems.'
        uninstall-only: '[AI] `flutter install --uninstall-only` is a command used in Flutter development to uninstall previously installed packages without reinstalling new ones. This can be helpful when you want to remove specific dependencies from your project without affecting other packages or causing potential conflicts during the installation process. By using this command, only the specified packages will be removed from your `pubspec.yaml` file and local cache, leaving the rest of your projects and installed packages untouched.'
