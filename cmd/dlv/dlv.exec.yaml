documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dlv exec` is a command used in Delve debugger (dlv), which is a debugger for Go programs. This command is used to execute Go source code under the control of the Delve debugger. You provide the source file and line number or function name as arguments, and Delve will start the program execution from that point, allowing you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and perform other debugging tasks.'
    flag:
        continue: '[AI] `dlv exec --continue` is a command used with the Delve debugger (dlv) for continuing execution of a previously paused or stopped Go program. It resumes the program from the current breakpoint or the last executed instruction without re-evaluating the expression or function call that caused the debugger to pause or stop.'
        tty: '[AI] `dlv exec` is a command from the Delve debugger (dlv), used to execute Go programs with debugging capabilities. The `--tty` flag enables a textual interactive terminal for the program being debugged, allowing users to interactively inspect and modify variables, step through code, and set breakpoints.'
