    command: |-
        [AI] The `adb install-multi-package` is not a valid Android Debug Bridge (ADB) command. ADB is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device directly, perform various tasks such as installing apps, pushing files, rebooting, etc.

        However, there isn't an official `install-multi-package` command in ADB. The correct way to install multiple APKs using ADB is by pushing the files to the device and then installing them individually using the `adb install <filename>` command.
    flag:
        abi: '[AI] `adb install-multi-package` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB), which allows installing multiple APK files at once on an Android device. The `--abi` option specifies the target Architecture Binary Interface (ABI) of the APKs to be installed, ensuring that the correct version of each APK is installed based on the device''s hardware capabilities.'
        d: '[AI] `adb install-multi-package -d` is a command used with Android Debug Bridge (adb). This command installs multiple APK files (-multi-package) on an Android device (-install) in debuggable mode (-d). It replaces the traditional way of installing multiple apps using `adb install App1.apk App2.apk ...`, making the process more efficient when dealing with a large number of packages.'
        date-check-agent: '[AI] `adb install-multi-package` is a command used with Android Debug Bridge (adb), a versatile tool for debugging and managing Android devices. This specific command variant installs multiple Android applications (APK files) in one go, with the `--date-check` option enabling an agent to filter APKs based on their last updated date. The `--multi-package` flag allows bundling multiple APKs together for batch installation.'
        fastdeploy: '[AI] `adb install-multi-package` is a command used in Android Development, specifically with the Android Debug Bridge (adb). This command allows for installing multiple APK files in one go on an Android device. The `--fastdeploy` option is an additional flag that accelerates the deployment process by using the FTS (Full Transfer Service) to push the APKs to the device without requiring a confirmation dialog for each installation. It can significantly reduce the time needed for installing multiple packages on the device.'
        force-agent: '[AI] The `adb install-multi-package` is a command used with Android Debug Bridge (adb) for installing multiple APK files in one go on an Android device. The `--force-agent` option is added to the command for resolving potential installation conflicts. When `--force-application` or `--force-multiple` are not specified, `--force-agent` is used as a default flag to apply the same permission and ownership to all the installed packages. In summary, this command installs multiple APKs with potential conflict resolution using the `--force-agent` option.'
        g: '[AI] The command `adb install-multi-package -g` is used with Android Debug Bridge (adb) for installing multiple APK packages in bulk on an Android device. The `-g` flag signifies that the installed apps will be granted global permissions, which means they have the ability to perform actions system-wide or across all apps. This can be useful when pushing several related apps at once and wanting them to function optimally without app compatibility issues arising from differing permission levels.'
        instant: '[AI] The `adb install-multi-package` command is used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to install multiple APK files on an Android device at once. The `--instant` flag is optional and it''s used to request the system to bypass the standard "Install from SD card" dialog and perform the installation silently and instantly, without user interaction. This can be useful for bulk or automated installations.'
        local-agent: '[AI] `adb install-multi-package` is a command used with Android Debug Bridge (ADB), which is a versatile command-line tool for communicating with and managing devices that have been enabled for USB debugging. This command facilitates the installation of multiple Android application packages (APKs) at once on an Android device using ADB, leveraging a local agent. By using `--local-agent`, you allow the Android device to act as the ADB server, eliminating the need for a computer to run the ADB server continuously during the installation process. This simplifies the workflow and can be particularly useful when dealing with multiple devices or large numbers of APKs.'
        no-fastdeploy: '[AI] `adb install-multi-package` is a command used with Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to install multiple APK files on an Android device in one go. The `--no-fastdeploy` option disables the "fastdeploy" mode, which is designed for efficient installation of large apps via a local file server. Without this option, ADB will instead install each APK file directly over USB or through the network using a standard installation process. This may take longer than fast deployment but can be useful in certain situations such as installing multiple smaller apps where fast deployment might not be necessary or available.'
        no-streaming: '[AI] `adb install-multi-package` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to install multiple APK files at once on an Android device. The `--no-streaming` option disables the streaming mode during installation, which means that ADB will download each APK file completely to your local system before sending it to the device for installation instead of sending it in a continuous stream. This can be useful when dealing with unstable network connections or large APK files.'
        p: '[AI] The `adb install-multi-package -p` command is used with Android Debug Bridge (adb) to install multiple APK files in one go on an Android device. The `-p` option specifies a list of packages or paths to the APK files, separated by colons (:). For example, `adb install-multi-package -p package1.apk:package2.apk:package3.apk` installs package1.apk, package2.apk, and package3.apk in one command.'
        r: '[AI] `adb install-multi-package -r` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for installing multiple APK files in rolled-back mode on an Android device. The "-r" flag signifies "rollback," meaning that if there are already installed versions of the apps, it will revert those applications to their previous states before installing the new packages. The "--install-multi-package" option allows ADB to handle multiple APK files at once.'
        streaming: '[AI] `adb install-multi-package --streaming` is a command used with Android Debug Bridge (adb) to install multiple Android application packages (APKs) in a streaming mode. In streaming mode, the APK files are sent to the device as a stream instead of being saved on the local system first. This can save time and storage space by avoiding the need to save each APK file locally before installation. The `--multi-package` option allows installing multiple packages at once.'
        t: '[AI] `adb install-multi-package` is a command used with Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for installing multiple Android application packages (APKs) in batch mode on an Android device. The `-t` option specifies that the APKs to be installed are located in a tape archive file (a .tbz or .tgz file), rather than individual APK files. This command facilitates installing multiple apps at once from a compressed archive, making it useful for mass deployments or testing scenarios.'
        version-check-agent: |-
            [AI] The command `adb install-multi-package --version-check-agent` is used in Android development with the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).

            `install-multi-package` is a subcommand that allows installing multiple APK files at once on an Android device connected via ADB.

            The option `--version-check-agent` instructs ADB to check for an available update of the Android version check agent before proceeding with the installation. If an update is available, ADB will download and install it first before continuing with the multi-package installation. This ensures that the device has the latest version of the agent, which might be required by some APKs, ensuring successful installation.
