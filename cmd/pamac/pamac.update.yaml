documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pamac update` is a command used in Arch Linux and its derivatives to synchronize the Pacman package manager''s repository indexes with the remote servers, preparing your system for installing or upgrading packages using Pamac, the GUI front-end for Pacman. It ensures that you have the latest information about available package versions.'
    flag:
        aur: '[AI] `pamac update --aur` is a command used in Arch Linux for updating the core system packages and their dependencies from the Arch User Repository (AUR). The `--aur` option tells `pamac`, the Arch Linux Package Manager, to include AUR packages in the update process. This command retrieves the latest package versions, compiles them if necessary, and installs any new or updated dependencies.'
        builddir: '[AI] `pamac update --builddir` is a command in Pamac, the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux. This specific command triggers an update of the package database (i.e., synchronizes it with remote repositories) and builds packages from source if they exist in the specified build directory. The `--builddir` option specifies the path to the custom build directory where Pamac will attempt to build packages if a source package is available and hasn''t been installed as a binary package yet. This command can be used to install updated versions of packages that aren''t available as binary packages, or to ensure that the built packages match specific configurations, such as using custom patches or flags.'
        devel: '[AI] `pamac update --devel` is a command used in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. It updates the system with the latest stable versions of installed packages, as well as the development (AUR) versions or "Soon-to-be-stable" packages from the Arch User Repository (AUR). This allows users to have access to newer software before it is officially released in the main repositories. However, using `--devel` may introduce instability and increased risk of conflicts or breaking dependencies. It''s recommended for power users and those who are comfortable with managing potential issues that might arise from having development packages installed.'
        disable-downgrade: '[AI] `pamac update --disable-downgrade` is a command used in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. This command disables the option to install older versions of packages during the system update process. The primary purpose is to maintain system security and stability by ensuring that all installed packages are up-to-date with their latest available versions. Using this command helps prevent potential security vulnerabilities and other issues that might be present in outdated packages.'
        download-only: '[AI] The `pamac update --download-only` command is a function of Pamac, the package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. This specific command instructs Pamac to download only the packages that have updates available without installing them. It''s commonly used when users want to save bandwidth or prepare their systems for an offline update session. The downloaded packages are stored in the local cache, ready for installation at a later time.'
        enable-downgrade: '[AI] `pamac update --enable-downgrade` is a command used in Arch Linux and its derivatives to update the system''s packages using the Pacman package manager, with an additional option to enable package downgrades. Ordinarily, when updating packages, newer versions supersede older ones. However, this command allows installing or keeping older versions of specific packages instead. This can be useful for testing or if a newer package version causes compatibility issues with other software. Note that using downgraded packages may introduce security vulnerabilities.'
        force-refresh: '[AI] `pamac update --force-refresh` is a command used in Arch Linux to force an update and refresh of the package database. It retrieves new metadata from the repositories, including available package upgrades, and updates the local package index without checking the current system packages against it. The `--force` or `-f` option is used to override any other warnings or conflicts that may occur during the update process.'
        ignore: '[AI] The `pamac update --ignore` command is used in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives. It skips the update of specific packages during the system upgrade process. Instead of updating those packages, their current versions will remain installed. This can be useful if you want to keep certain packages at their current state and avoid potential issues caused by updates. The ignore list should contain package names or regular expressions for multiple packages. For instance, `pamac update --ignore ''libvpx''` would skip the update of that specific package.'
        no-aur: '[AI] `pamac update --no-aur` is a command used in Arch Linux for updating the core system packages without installing or upgrading any packages from the Arch User Repository (AUR). The `--no-aur` flag ensures that only the official Arch Linux repositories are used during the update process. This can be useful to maintain a stable system by avoiding potential issues or conflicts that may arise from AUR packages.'
        no-confirm: '[AI] `pamac update --no-confirm` is a command used in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux to perform an update of all installed packages without prompting for confirmation before installing or removing any dependencies. The `--no-confirm` flag disables interactive prompts, allowing the update process to run uninterrupted. This can be useful for automation and batch processes, but it should be used with caution as there''s no opportunity to review changes before they are applied.'
        no-devel: '[AI] `pamac update --no-devel` is a command used in Arch Linux for updating the system''s package database and installing available package upgrades. The `--no-devel` flag is optional, but when included, it instructs Pamac (Arch Linux''s package manager) to exclude the development versions of packages during the update process. This can help minimize potential conflicts or unnecessary changes in production environments where only stable releases are desired.'
        overwrite: '[AI] `pamac update --overwrite` is a command used in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux. This command updates all installed packages to their latest available versions, while also force-replacing files that have conflicting modifications made by the user. The "--overwrite" option allows Pamac to replace existing local files with the new version from the package repository without asking for confirmation. This can be useful when upgrading packages that have modified configuration files or other user data that may cause conflicts after an update.'
