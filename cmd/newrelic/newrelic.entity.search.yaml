documentation:
    command: '[AI] `newrelic entity search` is a command used in New Relic''s APM product to query and filter entities (like applications, browsers, or hosts) within an account. It allows users to perform complex searches using various attributes such as name, type, tags, and custom properties. The results can be displayed in multiple formats like table or JSON, facilitating efficient management and analysis of the monitored entities.'
    flag:
        alert-severity: '[AI] The `--alert-severity` flag in New Relic Entity Search is used to specify the severity level for alerting on search results. Available severity levels are: `critical`, `error`, `warning`, and `info`. When you run a search query with this flag, New Relic will only generate alerts if the matched entities or events meet the specified severity level. This helps in filtering out irrelevant information and focusing on critical issues.'
        domain: '[AI] The `newrelic entity search --domain` command is used in New Relic''s observability platform to query and filter entities within a specific domain. A domain refers to a logical grouping of related resources or applications, such as an environment or a project. This command helps users to quickly find and analyze data related to the selected domain, enabling them to gain insights into the performance and health of their applications.'
        fields-filter: '[AI] `newrelic entity-search` is a command-line tool provided by New Relic to query and filter data in their observability platform. The `--fields-filter` option filters the output to include only specific fields or columns. For instance, `--fields-filter transaction.name,response.status_code` would return data with just those two fields for each matching entity.'
        name: '[AI] `newrelic entity search` is a command used in New Relic''s observability platform to search for specific entities, such as applications or services, based on their names. The `--name` flag is an option that allows you to specify the name of the entity you want to search for. When using this command with the `--name` flag, New Relic will return a list of entities with the specified name.'
        reporting: '[AI] `newrelic entity search --reporting` is a command used in New Relic''s Entity Search tool to generate and download reports containing search results. The command triggers the generation of a report based on previous queries or searches executed using the Entity Search API or UI. Once generated, the report can be downloaded as a CSV or JSON file for further analysis outside of the platform. This feature helps users to easily access and share detailed information about their monitored systems and applications.'
        tag: '[AI] The `newrelic entity search --tag` command is used in New Relic, a software performance monitoring tool, to search for entities (such as applications, hosts, or browsers) based on specific tags assigned to them. The tag argument specifies the key-value pair of the tag to be searched. For example, `--tag app:myappname` will return all entities with the tag "app" set to "myappname".'
        type: '[AI] The `newrelic entity search --type` command is a part of New Relic''s Entity Search API, which is used to query and filter specific types of entities within the New Relic platform, such as applications, browsers, hosts, or transactions. The `--type` flag specifies the particular type of entity to focus the search on. For instance, `newrelic entity search --type application` would return information related only to applications.'
