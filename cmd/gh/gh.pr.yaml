        [AI] The `gh pr` command is a shorthand for GitHub's Command Line Interface (CLI) to create, open, or view pull requests. It requires authentication to your GitHub account and must be run from the root directory of a Git repository linked to that account.

        Here are some common usage scenarios:

        * To create a new pull request based on the current branch: `gh pr create`
        * To open an existing pull request for review or merge: `gh pr open <number>`
        * To view information about a specific pull request: `gh pr view <number>`

        These commands interact with GitHub's API behind the scenes, allowing users to manage their pull requests directly from the command line.
