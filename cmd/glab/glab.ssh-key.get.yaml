documentation:
    command: '[AI] `glab ssh-key get` is a GitLab CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to download or save your GitLab SSH key privately as a file on your local machine. This command interacts with the GitLab server and retrieves the SSH key data that''s associated with the authenticated user, encrypts it using OpenSSH format, and saves the output into a local file (by default, ~/.ssh/id_gitlab.com). This allows you to set up secure SSH access to your GitLab projects without manually configuring each project separately.'
