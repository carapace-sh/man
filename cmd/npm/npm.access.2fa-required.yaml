documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm` command `access 2fa-required` is used to require Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for specified scopes in an npm package''s access control list. This helps secure the package by adding an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. To use this command, first log in with your npm account using `npm login`, then run the following command: `npm access 2fa-require <scope>`. Replace `<scope>` with the desired scope name for the package. For instance, to require 2FA for the publish scope: `npm access 2fa-require publish`. This will prompt you to enter a verification code from your authentication app each time someone attempts to use that scope.'
