description: Renew the certificate embedded in the kubeconfig file for the controller manager to use
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save the certificates
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubeconfig=: The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster. If the flag is not set, a set of standard locations can be searched for an existing kubeconfig file.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command `kubeadm certs renew controller-manager controller-manager.conf` is used to renew the TLS certificates for the Kubernetes controller-manager component. The `kubeadm certs renew` subcommand generates new certificates and private keys using the CA configuration in your Kubernetes cluster, and saves them in the specified file (in this case, `controller-manager.conf`) under the `$KUBEADM_CERTS/certs` directory. This command is typically run during regular cluster maintenance to ensure that certificates don''t expire and cause disruptions in your cluster.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew` is a command used to renew the TLS certificates for the Kubernetes controller-manager component in a cluster managed by Kubeadm. The `--cert-dir` option specifies the directory where the old certificate files are located and where the new certificates will be saved once they have been generated. This command ensures that the certificates used by the controller-manager remain valid, helping to maintain the security of the cluster.'
        config: '[AI] The command `kubeadm certs renew controller-manager` is used to renew the TLS certificates for the Kubernetes controller-manager component in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. The `--config` flag specifies the configuration directory of your Kubeadm setup. This command should be run periodically to ensure the security of your cluster, as expired or nearly-expired certificates can cause communication issues and potential security vulnerabilities.'
        kubeconfig: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew` is a command used to renew the TLS certificates for the Kubernetes controller-manager component in a Kubernetes cluster managed by `kubeadm`. The `--controller-manager` flag specifies that only the controller-manager certificates should be renewed. The `controller-manager.conf` argument refers to the configuration file for the controller-manager process, and `--kubeconfig` indicates that the command should use the current kubeconfig file for connecting to the cluster. In summary, this command renews the TLS certificates for the controller-manager component in a Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm`.'
