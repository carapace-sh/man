    command: '[AI] The `flutter pub outdated` command is used to check for outdated dependencies in a Flutter project''s `pubspec.yaml` file. When you run this command, it compares the currently installed packages with those specified in the `pubspec.yaml` file and lists any dependencies that have newer versions available in the public repository (Cranesdata). This helps developers keep their projects up-to-date by allowing them to easily identify and upgrade any outdated dependencies.'
    flag:
        color: '[AI] The `flutter pub outdated --color` command is used in Flutter development to check for packages with updated versions in the project''s `pubspec.yaml` file, displaying the output in color format for easier identification. It scans through the dependencies and dev_dependencies sections of the `pubspec.yaml`, and shows a list of packages with newer available versions than currently installed, along with the difference in version numbers. This command helps developers keep their projects up-to-date with the latest package versions, which can sometimes include bug fixes or new features.'
        dependency-overrides: |-
            [AI] The `flutter pub outdated --dependency-overrides` command is a utility provided by the Flutter development framework. It's used to check for outdated dependencies in your project and applies any specified overrides to compare against the published versions.

            When you run this command, it will scan your `pubspec.yaml` file for listed dependencies and their current versions. It then compares these versions with the latest available versions on pub.dev, the official package repository for Flutter. If it finds any outdated dependencies, it will display a list of them along with their suggested updates.

            The `--dependency-overrides` option allows you to provide a custom map of packages and their desired versions that may not be available on pub.dev yet or need to be locked down for development reasons. These overrides take precedence during the comparison, ensuring that your project uses only the specified versions even if updated ones are available.
        dev-dependencies: '[AI] `flutter pub outdated --dev-dependencies` is a command used in Flutter development to check for outdated dev dependencies in the project''s `pubspec.yaml` file. Dev dependencies are packages required for development, such as tests or development tools. Running this command displays a list of dev dependencies with newer available versions than currently installed, helping developers keep their projects up-to-date and potentially benefit from new features or bug fixes.'
        directory: '[AI] `flutter pub outdated --directory` is a command used in Flutter development to check for packages in the current project''s `pubspec.yaml` file that have newer versions available in the Flutter Package Manager repository. The `--directory` option specifies that the command should be run from the root directory of the Flutter project, and it will only output information about the outdated packages for that project.'
        help: '[AI] `flutter pub outdated --help` is a command used in Flutter development to check for outdated packages in the project''s `pubspec.yaml` file. When run with the `--help` flag, it provides detailed information about how to use this command effectively. It lists all the possible options and their meanings, such as `--mode` (which can be set to "long" or "short" to customize the output format) and `--quiet` (to suppress non-error messages). Overall, it helps users understand how to use this command for managing dependencies in a Flutter project.'
        json: '[AI] `flutter pub outdated --json` is a command-line tool provided by the Flutter framework to check for available package upgrades in your project''s `pubspec.yaml` file. The `--json` option generates output as a JSON object, which can be parsed and processed programmatically for automation or further analysis. This command returns information about the current version and the latest available versions of each dependency listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file, along with the differences between the two versions (if applicable).'
        mode: '[AI] The `flutter pub outdated --mode=production` command is used in Flutter development to check for packages with updated versions in the `pubspec.yaml` file, compared to what''s currently installed. The `--mode=production` argument specifies that only packages listed as dependencies with no version constraints should be checked. In other words, it checks for updates for packages where the version is explicitly specified in the `pubspec.yaml`. By default, this command also prints available upgrade suggestions and offers to run `flutter pub get --lockfile-write` to apply those upgrades.'
        no-color: '[AI] The command `flutter pub outdated --no-color` is used in Flutter projects to check for outdated packages in the `pubspec.yaml` file and their current versions in the project''s `.dart_tool/cache` directory. The `--no-color` flag disables the color output of the command, making it more suitable for use in scripts or automated environments where colored text might not be desirable.'
        no-dependency-overrides: '[AI] The `flutter pub outdated --no-dependency-overdates` command is used in Flutter development to check for available version updates of the dependencies listed in a project''s `pubspec.yaml` file without applying any automatic upgrades. This means that it reports only the dependencies with newer versions available, but does not modify the `pubspec.lock` or `pubspec.yaml` files. It is often used to identify potential updates before deciding whether or not to apply them.'
        no-dev-dependencies: '[AI] `flutter pub outdated --no-dev-dependencies` is a command used in Flutter development to check for outdated packages in the project''s `pubspec.yaml` file, excluding development dependencies. It scans the current project and lists the packages with newer versions available than what''s currently specified. By using the `--no-dev-dependencies` option, only regular dependencies are checked for updates.'
        no-show-all: '[AI] The `flutter pub outdated` command is used in Flutter projects to check for available updates for the packages listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file. The `--no-show-all` flag is an option that can be passed to this command to limit the output to only the packages with available updates, instead of displaying information for all packages, including those with no updates. This can help focus on the packages that need attention and reduce the amount of output.'
        no-transitive: '[AI] `flutter pub outdated --no-transitive` is a command used in Flutter development to check for outdated packages in the project''s `pubspec.yaml` file without considering transitive dependencies. Transitive dependencies are packages that other packages in your project depend on, but which are not explicitly listed in your `pubspec.yaml`. By using `--no-transitive`, you will only see the packages that need updates among the direct dependencies of your project.'
        show-all: '[AI] `flutter pub outdated --show-all` is a command used in Flutter development to check for outdated packages in the project''s `pubspec.yaml` file. The `--show-all` option displays detailed information about each package, including its current version and the latest available version, as well as the location where it is imported in the codebase. This command helps developers keep their dependencies up to date and maintain an efficient development environment.'
        transitive: '[AI] `flutter pub outdated --transitive` is a command used in the Flutter framework to check for packages with updated dependencies in the project''s `pubspec.yaml` file and its transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies). When run, it lists the packages with newer versions available, allowing developers to keep their projects up-to-date and ensure they are using the latest stable versions of their dependencies.'
