documentation:
    command: '[AI] `rust-analyzer ssr` is not a standard Rust command. The `rust-analyzer` tool is a Rust language server that provides autocompletion, error checking, and other features while coding in Rust. "ssr" is likely an abbreviation for some custom task or script. To use it with `rust-analyzer`, you would first define the script in your project''s `Cargo.toml` file under `[lib]` or `[bin]` section, then call it with `rust-analyzer run <script_name>`. For example: `rust-analyzer run myscript.rs`. If "ssr" is an existing Rust library or binary, you can use it like any other Rust command: `rust-analyzer ssr [arguments]`.'
