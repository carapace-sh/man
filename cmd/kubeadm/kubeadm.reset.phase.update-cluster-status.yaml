documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm reset` command is a utility in Kubernetes used to reset a Kubernetes cluster configuration. The `phase update-cluster-status` argument is a subcommand that instructs `kubeadm` to update the state of the entire cluster, including the etcd data, control plane nodes, and worker nodes. This means that all data will be lost, and the cluster will be reset to its initial state before applying new configuration. It''s often used when making significant changes to a cluster or troubleshooting issues.'
