    command: '[AI] `mpv` is a free and open-source media player for various operating systems, known for its advanced features and low resource consumption. It supports a wide range of video and audio formats, as well as various input interfaces like keyboard shortcuts, file drops, or URLs. It''s often used by power users for playing multimedia content with a high level of customization and control.'
    flag:
        '{': '[AI] The command `mpv --` is used with the media player MPV (Multi-Purpose Video player). The double dash `--` signifies that all following arguments are passed to MPV and not to any sub-command or option that `mpv` might have. In other words, these arguments will be treated as input file(s) or other options intended for MPV itself. For instance, `mpv --input-file video.mp4 --audio-track 1 --subtitle-file subtitle.vtt`.'
        '}': '[AI] `mpv --` is a prefix argument passed to the mpv media player command, indicating that all following arguments are meant for options. This allows passing multiple options at once without having to repeat the `--` separator between each one. For example: `mpv --fullscreen --subtitle file.ass --quit input.mp4`.'
        ab-loop-a: '[AI] `--ab-loop-a` is a command-line option for the media player MPV. It stands for "Auto Balance (A)nalysis and Adjust (L)evels, loop (p)er frame" and is used to automatically adjust audio levels and balance between left and right channels throughout the media playback. The "loop per frame" part indicates that the adjustments are made on every frame of the media.'
        ab-loop-b: '[AI] The `--ab-loop-b` flag is a command-line option for the media player MPV. It''s used to enable an advanced feature called A-B looping, where a specific section of a media file is repeatedly played. The "b" in the flag stands for "backwards," indicating that the loop starts from the end and moves backward in the file towards the beginning. This can be useful for repeatedly practicing or analyzing a particular segment of a video or audio recording.'
        ab-loop-count: '[AI] `--ab-loop-count` is a command-line option for the media player MPV. It specifies the number of times to repeat an atomic unit (a segment defined by timestamps or a regular expression) in an input file during playback. For example, `--ab-loop-count=3` would cause a specified atom to be repeated three times. This option can be useful for looping specific parts of a media file.'
        access-references: '[AI] `mpv` is a free and open-source media player written in C. The option `--access-references` is used to enable or disable accessing external references (i.e., subtitles, metadata, etc.) during media playback. When this flag is set to `true`, mpv will actively seek out and utilize external references. Conversely, setting it to `false` disables this functionality. This option can be useful for security reasons or to improve performance by reducing the number of external requests made during playback.'
        ad: '[AI] `mpv` is a free and open-source media player for videos and audio files. The option `--ad` is a command-line argument that can be passed to `mpv`. It stands for "automatic demuxing of ads," which means that `mpv` will identify and separate commercial breaks or advertisements within the media file, allowing users to skip them individually if desired.'
        ad-lavc-ac3drc: '[AI] The `--ad-lavc-ac3drc` flag is a command-line option for the media player MPV. It enables decoding of Advanced Audio Codec (AAC) streams using the Libavcodec AC-3 Decoder (`ac3drc`) during ad playback. This allows MPV to play ads that use the AC-3 audio codec while maintaining compatibility with other media formats.'
        ad-lavc-downmix: '[AI] The `--ad-lavc-downmix` flag is a command-line option for the media player MPV. It instructs MPV to use the FFmpeg library''s LAVC downmixing filter when handling audio streams with multiple channels. Downmixing reduces the number of audio channels (e.g., from 5.1 surround sound to stereo) for playback on devices that support fewer channels. This option enables downmixing using the LAVC codec, which is often faster and more efficient than other downmixing methods.'
        ad-lavc-o: '[AI] The `--ad-lavc-o` flag is a command-line option for the media player MPV. It specifies that MPV should use FFmpeg''s Libavcodec engine to decode and encode Adaptive Streaming (e.g., HLS or DASH) audio and video streams during advertisements. The output of this decoding and encoding process is written to standard output instead of being displayed, allowing the user to modify or redirect it if desired.'
        ad-lavc-o-add: '[AI] The `--ad-lavc-o-add` flag is a command-line option for the media player MPV. It instructs MPV to use the Libavcodec library to decode and mux advertisements as separate streams during live streaming or recording, using the specified output option (`-o`) with the `ad` flag. This allows for separate handling of ads and main content in the output file or stream.'
        ad-lavc-o-append: '[AI] The `--ad-lavc-o-append` flag is a command-line option for the media player MPV. It''s used to append advertisements to the output media file using the Libavformat encoder (`lavc`). When this option is set, MPV will save any advertisement streams it encounters during media playback as additional bits in the output file. This can be useful for creating a single file with the main content and all its ads for distribution or archiving purposes.'
        ad-lavc-o-remove: '[AI] The `--ad-lavc-o-remove` flag in MPV, a popular media player, is used to disable the removal of ads encoded using the Libavcodec library during media playback. By default, MPV automatically removes ads detected by Libavcodec, but this option can be used to override that behavior and keep the ads in the output stream.'
        ad-lavc-o-set: |-
            [AI] `mpv` is a free and open-source media player written in C. The option `--ad-lavc-o-set` is used to configure the FFmpeg library's internal encoding settings for handling multimedia streams during advertisement playback.

            Specifically, this option sets the output (`o`) option for the H.264 (AVC) video encoder (`lavc`) within `mpv`. The exact meaning of the setting depends on the specific command line arguments that follow `--ad-lavc-o-set`. For instance, it could be used to set encoding parameters like bitrate, quality level or max size.

            In summary, `mpv --ad-lavc-o-set` allows users to fine-tune the video encoding settings for advertisements that are played within the media player.
        ad-lavc-threads: '[AI] The `--ad-lavc-threads` flag in MPV media player is used to configure the number of threads for FFmpeg''s Libavcodec Advertising (AD) module when decoding and encoding audio and video streams using the Lavc library. Setting this option can impact the playback performance by affecting how many threads are allocated for these tasks. The default value is usually set to an automatic determination, but specifying a number allows manual overriding for optimal system configuration.'
        ad-queue-enable: '[AI] The `--ad-queue-enable` flag in MPV, a popular open-source media player, enables the ad queue feature. This allows MPV to buffer and play ads that are inserted in the media file or stream being played back-to-back without user interaction. It is often used with live streams or media containing commercial breaks. The flag ensures these ads are played according to their scheduled order and without requiring manual intervention from the user.'
        ad-queue-max-bytes: '[AI] The `--ad-queue-max-bytes` flag in mpv (Multimedia Player VLC), is a configuration option that sets the maximum size of the ad queue buffer. It specifies the limit for the amount of data that can be buffered for advertisements ahead of the media playback. When this limit is reached, mpv will start to drop ads from the queue to make room for new ones, ensuring a smooth media playback experience without excessive delays due to ad buffering.'
        ad-queue-max-samples: '[AI] The `--ad-queue-max-samples` flag in MPV, a popular media player, sets the maximum number of advertisement samples (audio or video frames) that can be queued for playback. This flag helps control the experience of watching content with numerous ads by limiting the amount of ad data that is buffered at any given time. It allows users to have more control over their viewing experience and potentially reduce latency issues caused by excessive ad data buffering.'
        ad-queue-max-secs: '[AI] The `--ad-queue-max-secs` flag in mpv, a media player software, sets the maximum duration (in seconds) of an ad queue. An ad queue refers to the buffer where ads are stored before they are played. This flag allows users to control how long mpv will store and playback ads before the main content resumes. A larger value means more ads can be buffered and played back-to-back, while a smaller value limits the number of ads that can be queued.'
        af: '[AI] The `--af` option in the MPV media player is used to specify an external filter or script for applying audio filters. The full command with this option would look like: `mpv [video-file] --af [filter-command]`. The filter-command can be a file path to a dynamic filter, or a pipe symbol `|` followed by a command in the terminal. For example, `mpv video.mkv --af "volume=10dB,equalizer=bass=3.5:presence=4:treble=2.5"` applies volume boost and equalizer filter to the audio stream.'
        af-add: |-
            [AI] `mpv` is a free and open-source media player written in C. The option `--af-add` is used to apply an additional audio filter (an audio post-processing effect) in `mpv`. Multiple filters can be chained by providing multiple `--af-add` options. Each filter definition includes the filter name, its arguments if any, and is enclosed in parentheses, separated by commas. For example:

            ```sh
            mpv --input input.mp4 --af "(volume=0.5, avolume=1.2)" --af-add "(equalizer=3)"
            ```

            This command plays the file `input.mp4`, applies a volume reduction of 50% (`volume=0.5`) followed by a 2 dB amplification (`avvolume=1.2`), and then adds an equalizer audio filter with a preset level of 3.
        af-append: '[AI] `mpv` is a free and open-source media player for various platforms. The option `--af-append` is used to append one or more audio filters to the media file being played without replacing any existing filters. This can be useful when you want to apply multiple audio filters to modify the sound in different ways. For instance, you might use `--af-append "equalizer=band=3:gain=-3dB" --af-append "volumefilter=volume=0.5"` to apply an equalizer and volume filter to the audio stream.'
        af-clr: '[AI] The `--af-clr` option in MPV, a popular open-source media player, is used to clear any previously applied automatic subtitle tracks. It doesn''t directly relate to flags for specifying subtitle files or languages, but rather resets the automatic subtitle selection feature.'
        af-defaults-add: |-
            [AI] `mpv` is a free and open-source media player written in C. The command `--af-defaults-add` is an option used with this media player to add or append automatic filter (AF) chains, which are a type of audio filter in `mpv`.

            When you use `--af-defaults-add`, you specify a list of AF filters, each separated by a space. The options are applied every time you play a media file without the need to include them in the command line for each individual media file. This makes it convenient to apply common audio filters consistently across multiple media files.
        af-defaults-append: |-
            [AI] `mpv` is a versatile media player with various options to customize its behavior. The `--af-defaults-append` flag is used to append new filters to the existing automatic filter chain for applying audio post-processing effects.

            For instance, to add a noise reduction filter and normalize the output volume, you can use:
            ```bash
            mpv --af-defaults-append="noise=n=3:thresh=0.1,dynaudnorm" file.ext
