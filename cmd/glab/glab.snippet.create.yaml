    command: |-
        [AI] The `glab snippet create` command is used in GitLab to create a new code snippet in your personal snippets collection or a specific group. You provide the file path, name, and contents of the snippet as arguments, and Glab creates a new .gitlab-ci.yml file with a `snippet` job that pushes the content to your GitLab account. For example:

        ```sh
        glab snippet create my_snippet --file my_script.sh --name My Snippet
        ```

        This command will create a new snippet named "My Snippet" with the contents of the file `my_script.sh`. If you want to store the snippet in a specific group, use the `--group` or `-g` option:

        ```sh
        glab snippet create my_snippet --file my_script.sh --name My Snippet --group my_group
        ```
    flag:
        description: '[AI] `glab snippet create` is a command used in GitLab''s CLI tool, Glab. The `--description` flag is optional and is used to provide a brief explanation or summary of what the new code snippet is intended for when it''s being created. This description will be saved along with the snippet, making it easily identifiable within your collection of snippets in GitLab.'
        filename: '[AI] The `glab snippet create` command is used in GitLab to create a new snippet, which is a piece of reusable code, script, or configuration, stored under the `.gitlab` directory in your project or personal namespace in GitLab. The `--filename` option specifies the name you want to give to the new snippet file. So, this command creates a new snippet with the given filename when executing it in the terminal while authenticated to GitLab.'
        title: '[AI] The `glab snippet create` command is used to create a new snippet in Glab, which is a GitHub Action for Git workflows. The `--title` option sets the title or name of the new snippet file. When you run this command, it creates a new file with the given title and opens an editor where you can write the code for the snippet. Once saved and committed, the snippet will be available for use in your GitHub Actions workflows.'
        visibility: |-
            [AI] The `glab snippet create` command with the `--visibility` flag is used to create a new snippet in Glab (GitLab CLI) and set its visibility level. The `--visibility` option allows specifying whether the created snippet should be private or shared among collaborators within a project or even publicly accessible.

            Here are some possible values for `--visibility`:
            - `private`: creates a private snippet that is only visible to the user creating it.
            - `internal`: creates an internal snippet that can be accessed by users with the same group membership as the creator.
            - `public`: creates a public snippet that can be accessed by anyone, including those outside of the project or organization.

            For example, to create a private snippet named "my_snippet", use the following command:
            ```
            glab snippet create my_snippet --file my_file.txt --visibility private
            ```
