    command: '[AI] `asciinema play` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to replay a recording of terminal sessions made with asciinema. It takes an ASCIICast file, which is created by the `asciinema record` command, as its argument and displays the terminal output and input interactions contained within the file in real time. This can be useful for sharing or reviewing terminal sessions with others.'

            [AI] `asciinema play` is a command-line tool from the asciinema project used to replay terminal sessions as interactive videos or animated GIFs. The `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use this specific command, including any available flags and arguments. Here's a brief explanation of the help output:

            - `asciinema play [OPTIONS] FILENAME`: Play an asciinema recording.
            - ` Options:`: Lists various options that can be set when using the command.
              - `--color <auto|always|never>`: Set color mode for output (auto, always or never).
              - `--duration <ms>`: Duration of video in milliseconds.
              - `--fps <Hz>`: Frames per second.
              - `--loop`: Loop the playback.
              - `--no-ansi`: Disable ANSI escape sequences.
              - `--quiet`: Suppress progress output.
              - `--start <second>`: Start from a specific second in the recording.
              - `--stop <second>`: Stop at a specific second in the recording.
            - `--help` or `-h`: Display this help message and exit.
            - `--version` or `-V`: Print version information and exit.
        idle-time-limit: '[AI] `ascinema play --idle-time-limit` is a command used in the Asciinema project to playback and share terminal sessions as animated GIFs or MP4 videos. The `--idle-time-limit` option sets a limit on how long Asciinema will wait for new input before considering the session idle and stopping the recording. This can be useful to exclude extended periods of inactivity, such as during long build processes or system bootups, from the recorded output.'
        speed: '[AI] `asciinema play --speed` is a command from the asciinema utility used to replay terminal recordings. The `--speed` option adjusts the speed of the replay, with higher numbers increasing the speed and lower numbers decreasing it. For example, `asciinema play recording.asc --speed 2` would play the recording at double speed.'
