The `--jq` flag is used to apply JavaScript-like queries (JQ filters) on the JSON output of the `repo view` command.

        web: '[AI] `gh repo view --web` is a command from GitHub''s CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool, called "gh", used to open and interact with a specific repository in a web browser.
