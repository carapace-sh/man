documentation:
    command: '[AI] `consul acl role delete` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Consul service to remove an existing Access Control List (ACL) role definition. When you run this command, you specify the name or ID of the role to be deleted as an argument. The Consul ACL server will then remove the specified role from its internal data store, effectively revoking any associated permissions. This command can help in managing and maintaining your organization''s access control policies within Consul.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] The `consul acl role delete --ca-file` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) role in Consul, which is a Connect and Key Value store and service discovery solution. This command requires providing a CA file (Certificate Authority), which is used for securing communication between the Consul client and server using TLS. The `consul` tool interprets this flag to perform an ACL operation, specifically role deletion, over a secure connection authenticated by the provided CA file.'
        ca-path: '[AI] `consul acl role delete --ca-path` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) role with the specified CA (Certificate Authority) path. The `--ca-path` option specifies the location of the CA certificate file that was used to sign the Consul tokens associated with the role being deleted. It helps ensure secure deletion of roles by requiring the consent of the CA before the role can be removed.'
        client-cert: '[AI] The `consul acl role delete` command is used to remove an Access Control List (ACL) role from Consul, which is an open-source, distributed, and consensus-driven toolkit for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. The `--client-cert` flag specifies that the request should be authenticated using a client certificate. It ensures that only authorized clients with valid certificates can delete ACL roles from Consul. This helps maintain security by controlling who has permission to make such changes in the system.'
        client-key: '[AI] The `consul acl role delete --client-key` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command deletes an Access Control List (ACL) role with the specified client key from Consul''s ACL policy. It is part of the Consul ACL subcommand suite, which allows managing access control policies programmatically.'
        datacenter: '[AI] The `consul acl role delete --datacenter` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source distributed, highly available, and data center ready solution to connect and secure services. This command deletes an Access Control List (ACL) role specific to a datacenter within Consul''s ACL system. It removes the defined permissions for that role, limiting access control capabilities in the datacenter. By deleting a role, you can modify your security configurations as needed.'
        http-addr: '[AI] The `consul acl role delete --http-addr` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) role in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. The `--http-addr` flag specifies the HTTP interface address of the Consul server to connect to when executing the command. In summary, this command deletes a specific ACL role from the given Consul server instance.'
        id: '[AI] The command `consul acl role delete --id <role-id>` is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) role in Hashicorp Consul, a service mesh and configuration management tool. The `<role-id>` is the unique identifier of the role to be deleted. This command removes the specified role from Consul''s access control configuration, revoking its associated permissions.'
        name: '[AI] The `consul acl role delete` command is used to remove an Access Control List (ACL) role from Consul, which is a connectivity and service discovery tool. This command takes the `--name` option followed by the name of the ACL role you wish to delete. When executed, this command deletes the specified ACL role from the Consul server''s ACL policies, removing its associated permissions and capabilities.'
        namespace: '[AI] The `consul acl role delete --namespace` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) role in Consul, which is a service discovery, configuration, and orchestration tool. This specific command deletes an ACL role within a given Kubernetes namespace. Consul uses namespaces for organizational purposes to separate different environments or teams within the same Consul cluster. By specifying the `--namespace` flag followed by the name of the namespace, you are limiting the scope of the operation to that particular namespace. The `consul acl role delete` command is used to remove an existing ACL role''s permissions and access to resources in that specific namespace.'
        stale: |-
            [AI] `consul acl role delete --stale` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, an IT management solution that provides service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command deletes stale Access Control List (ACL) roles in Consul.

            Stale roles are those that no longer have any associated permissions due to resource removal or changes in the system. By running `consul acl role delete --stale`, you can clean up your ACLs and maintain a more secure and efficient Consul environment. This command does not require specifying any role names as it deletes only those that are no longer in use.
        tls-server-name: '[AI] The `consul acl role delete --tls-server-name` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) role in Hashicorp Consul, which is a service discovery and configuration management tool. The `--tls-server-name` flag specifies the TLS server name to use when connecting to the Consul server securely over Transport Layer Security (TLS). This command does not create or modify ACL roles; it only deletes them. The deletion of an ACL role removes its associated permissions, allowing access control policies to be updated or changed as needed.'
        token: '[AI] The command `consul acl role delete --token` is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) role in Hashicorp Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool. The `--token` argument specifies the Consul token with sufficient privileges to perform the role deletion operation. This command does not take any additional arguments to specify the name or ID of the role to be deleted, so it must be run with a token attached to an account that has administrative access to the Consul ACL policy in order to delete roles.'
        token-file: '[AI] The `consul acl role delete` command is used to delete an Access Control List (ACL) role in Hashicorp Consul. This command requires an authentication token, which is provided through the `--token-file` option, specifying the path to the file containing the token. Together, this command deletes a specific ACL role with the given access permissions from Consul''s authorization and authentication configuration.'
