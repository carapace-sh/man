documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea repos list` command is used in the TEAS (Teamwork Engined Application System) version control system to display a list of available repositories or projects under management. It does not take any arguments and returns output that typically includes repository names, URLs, and other relevant information.'
    flag:
        fields: |-
            [AI] The `--fields` option in the Git command `git texrepos list` is used to display only specific fields or columns of information for each repository when listing them. It allows you to customize the output by specifying a comma-separated list of desired fields, such as:

            * Name (short or full name)
            * Remote URL
            * Local directory path
            * Branch or commit SHA
            * Last fetch or last update time.

            For example, `--fields=name,remote,local_path` will display only the repository name, remote URL, and local path in the output.
        limit: '[AI] The `tea repos list --limit` command is used in the Tectonic (now D2Q) container orchestration platform to retrieve a list of repositories with a maximum number of items displayed. The `--limit` option sets the number of items to be shown in the output. For instance, `tea repos list --limit 5` would display only the first 5 repositories from the available list.'
        login: '[AI] `tee api repos list --login` is a command used in the Git version control system with the TeeUI CLI (Command Line Interface) for managing Git repositories. The command lists all the repositories managed by TeeUI, displaying each repository''s name and associated login credentials (username and personal access token). It helps users manage and keep track of their Git repositories with ease.'
        output: '[AI] The `tea repos list --output` command is used with the Tea API (A Kubernetes package management system) to list all available repositories and output the results in a machine-readable format, such as JSON or YAML. This can be helpful for automating tasks related to managing Kubernetes packages from various repositories.'
        page: '[AI] The `tea repos list --page` command is used in the Git tool `teapot`, a Git client written in Rust. It lists the repositories managed by Teapot and displays them in pages if there are many. The `--page` option specifies which page of results to display. For example, `--page 2` would show the second page of repositories.'
        starred: '[AI] `git tea repos list --starred` is a Git command used with the Git Tea client, an alternative Git interface. This command lists all Git repositories in your Git Tea collection with a star (favorite) designation. The `--starred` option filters the output to only display those repositories that have been marked as favorites.'
        type: '[AI] The `tea repos list --type` command is used in the Tectonic (now Docker for Kubernetes) platform to list available repository types. Repository types define how images are stored and managed within a Tectonic cluster. This command displays a list of available repository types along with their descriptions.'
        watched: '[AI] The `tea repos list --watched` command is used with the "tea" CLI tool in GitHub''s Hub packaging for managing Git repositories. This specific command lists all the watched repositories, which are those repositories where you have enabled notifications for new releases or updates. The output displays each repository name and its associated URL.'
