documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nix` command with the `nar` (Nix Artifact) subcommand and the `ls` (list) argument is used to list Nix artifacts in a Nix expression or Nixos configuration file. It prints the name, size, and hash of each referenced artifact. This command helps to ensure that the correct versions of dependencies are being used and can be useful for troubleshooting build issues.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `nix-env` is a package manager for Nix, a configuration management system. The command `nix-env --debug nixpkgs` followed by `ls` is used to list all the packages and their current build and installation states in a debug mode. The `--debug` flag increases the amount of output, providing more detailed information for each package. `nixpkgs` refers to the default Nix expression set, which includes all available packages. So, this command lists out comprehensive details about all the installed packages in the system.'
        directory: '[AI] The command `nix-env --flag-add ghc package --arg ''--pinned'' ''version number'' --directory /path/to/store` sets up a new Nix environment with the given Haskell package version and stores it in the specified directory. The `ls --directory` part of the command is used to list the contents of a directory as a list of path prefixes, which is useful when working with file systems managed by Nix. So, this whole command sets up a new environment, lists the directory where it will be stored, and then stores it there.'
        json: '[AI] `nix-jar` is a command from the Nix package manager, and `ls` is a common Unix command for listing files and directories. The `--json` option tells `ls` to output its results in JSON format. When used together with `nix-jar`, the command `nix nar ls --json` lists all the built outputs of a Nix expression as a JSON object, including their names, sizes, and file paths.'
        log-format: |-
            [AI] `nix` is a configuration management system, and `nar` is a command-line tool for managing Nix expressions. The `ls` command in NAR is used to list available Nix expressions.

            The option `--log-format` specifies the format of the output logged when using `ls`. By default, it shows a list of expression names and their hashes. With `--log-format`, you can customize the output to include additional information such as size, description, or build output.

            For example, `nix nar ls --log-format 'v %version:v %name:s %size:b'` will display the version number, name, and size in bytes of each expression.
        long: |-
            [AI] `nix` is not a flag but a package manager for Linux and other Un*x systems. The command `nar` is not part of the standard `nix` toolkit, so it's unrelated to this question.

            The command `ls --long` is a command in Un*x file systems for listing files and directories in a long format. The `--long` option displays additional information such as file permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and modification time.
        print-build-logs: '[AI] `nix-build` or `nix-env` with the command `--print-build-logs` option generates and prints build logs for a specific Nix expression during its execution. These logs contain detailed information about the construction process, such as inputs, outputs, and any errors that may occur. This can be helpful for debugging issues or understanding the dependencies and build steps involved in creating a Nix package.'
        quiet: '[AI] The command `nix-env --query --list --quiet` is used in Nix package manager to list installed packages in a minimal and quiet format. The `--quiet` option suppresses the output of version numbers and other extraneous information, displaying only the package names. The flag `ls` is not part of this command but is often used in combination with it for listing multiple packages at once. In summary, this command lists installed packages quietly, showing only their names.'
        recursive: |-
            [AI] `nix` is not a flag, but a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The command `nix-env --install` or `nix-build` is typically used with it to install or build software.

            The command `ls --recursive` is part of the Unix file system utilities, specifically the `ls` (list) command. The option `--recursive` or `-R` instructs `ls` to list all files and directories recursively in a tree format, including hidden files and directories, within a specified directory.
        verbose: '[AI] `nix` is a package manager for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, and `nar` is a component of Nix that manages compressed builds (artifacts). The command `nix nar ls --verbose` lists the available artifacts in a Nix build output directory with detailed information. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output to include additional metadata such as size, SHA256 checksum, and creation time for each artifact.'
