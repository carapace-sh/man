    command: '[AI] The `rustup show active-toolchain` command is used in Rust programming to display information about the currently activated toolchain, including its name, version, and installation path. This command helps developers verify which toolchain is being used in their current Rust development environment.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] The command `rustup show active-toolchain --help` is used with Rustup, a tool for managing multiple Rust toolchains and sets, to display help information about the `show active-toolchain` subcommand. This subcommand is specifically designed to show details about the currently active Rust toolchain, including its name, hash, and installation directory. By appending `--help`, the user will get a brief explanation of how to use this command effectively. For instance, they''ll learn about available options like `--json` or `--verbose` that may modify the output format.'
        quiet: '[AI] `rustup show active-toolchain --quiet` is a command used in Rust programming language''s Rustup tool to display the currently active Rust toolchain in a minimal format. The output contains only the name and the hash of the active toolchain.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `rustup show active-toolchain --verbose` command is used to display detailed information about the currently active Rust toolchain in the Rustup environment manager. The `--verbose` flag increases the output''s level of detail, providing more information such as the toolchain name, version, installation path, and target triple. This command helps users understand which Rust toolchain is being used for their projects and provides essential details for troubleshooting or configuring their Rust development environment.'
        version: |-
            [AI] `rustup show active-toolchain --version` is a Rust command that displays detailed information about the currently active Rust toolchain, including its name and version number. The output will typically look like this:

            ```bash
            default (default)
            name = stable
            hash = 9e0f3d7e2d38165eb9dc2c2a4bf4f2f63cb203d1
            source = registry+https://api.rustup.io/v1
            overrides = []

            (*) rustc 1.57.0 (4e1b11abc 2021-08-03)
            ```

            The first part of the output indicates the name and current status (default, in this case) of the toolchain. The `name` field tells us that this is the stable channel. The `hash` field shows the commit ID that this version corresponds to. `source` indicates where Rustup obtained the toolchain from. Finally, the `(*):` line displays information about the currently active Rust compiler (rustc), including its name and version number.
