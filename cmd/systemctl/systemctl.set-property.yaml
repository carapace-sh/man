        [AI] `systemctl` is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. The `set-property` command is used to change the properties of a systemd service. Properties define various behavior settings for the service, such as RestartPolicy (how the service should be restarted if it crashes), Environment (custom environment variables), or WorkingDirectory (the directory where the service process should run).

        The basic usage is `systemctl set-property <service_name> <property_name> <value>`. For example, to change the RestartPolicy of a service named 'apache2' to 'always', use: `sudo systemctl set-property apache2.service Restart=on-failure`. To view the current properties of a service, use: `systemctl show <service_name>` or `systemctl cat <service_name>`.
