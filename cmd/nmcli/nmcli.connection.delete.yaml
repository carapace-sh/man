description: Delete an existing connection profile
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nmcli connection delete` command is used to remove a network connection configuration stored in NetworkManager, a common network management system for Linux systems. You provide the connection name as an argument to this command, and it will permanently delete that particular connection configuration. This command does not affect the current active connections; you would need to use `nmcli connection down` followed by `nmcli connection delete` if you want to remove a currently active connection.'
