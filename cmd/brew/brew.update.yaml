description: Fetch the newest version of Homebrew and all formulae from GitHub using `git`(1) and perform any necessary migrations
group: main
flags:
    --auto-update: Run on auto-updates (e.g. before `brew install`). Skips some slower steps.
    --debug: Display a trace of all shell commands as they are executed.
    --force: Always do a slower, full update check (even if unnecessary).
    --help: Show this message.
    --merge: Use `git merge` to apply updates (rather than `git rebase`).
    --quiet: Make some output more quiet.
    --verbose: Print the directories checked and `git` operations performed.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `brew update` is a Homebrew command used to fetch and install the latest versions of formulae and their dependencies from the Homebrew repository. It syncs the local Homebrew installation with the remote repositories, ensuring that you have the most current software packages available. This command should be run regularly to keep your Homebrew installation up-to-date.'
    flag:
        auto-update: |-
            [AI] The `brew update --auto-update` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command has two parts:

            1. `brew update`: This part updates Homebrew itself to the latest version and also fetches the latest versions of all installed formulas (packages). It does not install any new packages or make changes to your system by default, but simply prepares everything for you to do so if desired.

            2. `--auto-update`: This part is an optional flag that enables Homebrew's automatic update feature. With this flag enabled, Homebrew will automatically install updates for your installed formulas whenever those updates are released. The flag can be set globally or on a per-formula basis in the ~/.brewrc file. Using it with the `update` command just sets it temporarily for that session.
        debug: '[AI] `brew update --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command initiates an update of Homebrew''s installed formulae and tap sources to their latest versions with enhanced debugging output. The debugging information provides more detailed and verbose messages during the update process, helping to diagnose any potential issues or gain insight into the underlying mechanics of Homebrew updates.'
        force: '[AI] The `brew update --force` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command performs an automatic check for updates to Homebrew itself and all installed packages in your system, then downloads and installs the latest versions. The `--force` option overrides any conflicts or errors that might occur during the update process, allowing the installation to complete even if some dependencies or configurations need to be manually adjusted afterwards. It''s important to note that using this option can lead to potential issues if not used carefully. Always backup important data before running `brew update --force`.'
        help: '[AI] `brew update --help` is a command used in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. This command displays detailed help information about the `brew update` command. It is used to fetch and merge changes from upstream Git repositories into Homebrew''s repositories, keeping your system up-to-date with the latest software versions. By adding `--help`, you will get an explanation of various options and arguments that can be used with `brew update`.'
        merge: |-
            [AI] `brew update --merge` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command performs two tasks in one step:

            1. It fetches the latest versions of the formulae and casks (packages) from the Homebrew repository.
            2. It merges the changes into your local system, updating the installed packages accordingly while keeping customizations.

            The `--merge` option ensures that any local modifications to a formula or cask are kept during the update process. This command is commonly used when you want to keep your system updated with the latest packages while preserving personal configurations.
        quiet: |-
            [AI] The command `brew update --quiet` is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command performs an automatic update of Homebrew's formulae (recipes) and its installed packages from the Homebrew repository.

            The `--quiet` flag is optional and suppresses informational output during the update process. It runs the update in a quiet mode, meaning only error messages will be displayed if any occur. This flag is useful when running updates in scripts or automated workflows where unnecessary text output might interfere.
        verbose: '[AI] `brew update --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command updates Homebrew itself and the tap formulas (third-party repositories) to their latest versions. The `--verbose` option increases the level of output, displaying detailed information about each step taken during the update process. It helps users understand what is happening behind the scenes while the command is being executed.'
