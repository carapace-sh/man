    command: '[AI] The `waypoint server snapshot` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source infrastructure automation tool by Hashicorp, to take a point-in-time backup of the current state of all managed resources and configurations. This includes the entire state of the Waypoint application, such as modules, jobs, and their respective configurations. The snapshot can be saved locally or remotely, providing a reliable way to restore the infrastructure to its previous state if necessary.'

        app: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint server snapshot --app"` is used in Waypoint, an open-source GitOps tool for Kubernetes, to create a snapshot of the current application configuration.

This output can be used to compare and manage differences between configurations across different environments or versions, making it useful for version control, backup, or compliance purposes.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint server snapshot --project` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool to take a snapshot of the current state of a specified project in the Waypoint registry. This operation captures all the configuration data associated with that project and stores it as an immutable versioned artifact. This snapshot can be later restored or compared against other snapshots for version control, rollback, or compliance purposes.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint server snapshot --workspace` command in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool creates a snapshot of the current state of a specific workspace in your Waypoint configuration. This snapshot can be used for backup, versioning, or to restore a previous configuration. The `--workspace` flag specifies which workspace to take the snapshot of.'
