    command: |-
        [AI] The term "prettyping" is not a standard command or concept in computer programming or scripting. It might be a typo or an abbreviation of other common commands such as "pretty-printing" or "formatting."

        Pretty-printing refers to the automatic reformatting and indenting of code, making it more visually appealing and easier to read. This can be useful when dealing with large code files or merging changes from multiple developers. Tools like Prettier, YAMLfmt, or autopep8 can be used for pretty-printing various file formats such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Python.
    flag:
        "6": '[AI] The flag `-6` in the command `prettyping -6` is likely a formatting option for an output that is being produced by a tool called `prettyping`. The flag specifies that only the last six columns of data should be displayed. This can be useful when dealing with wide outputs and wanting to focus on a specific subset of columns.'
        R: '[AI] `prettyping -R` is a Git configuration command used to enable or disable automatic pretty-printing of Git output. The `-R` option stands for "recursive," meaning it applies the configuration not only to the current repository but also to all nested submodules. Enabling this option can make Git output easier to read and understand by applying various formats to different types of Git objects, such as commits, branches, or tags.'
        a: '[AI] `prettyping -a` is a command used in Git, specifically with the Prettier configuration tool. The `-a` (or `--all`) flag instructs Prettier to format all files in the current repository, not just those with extensions specified in the default list. It helps ensure consistent formatting across all files within the project.'
        awkbin: '[AI] `prettyping --awkbin` is a command used in Git for formatting AWK scripts or binaries during Git commits. The `prettyping` part refers to Git''s ability to automatically reformat and beautify code, while `--awkbin` specifies that the formatter to be used is for AWK scripts or binaries. This command ensures consistent formatting of AWK code across your project and makes Git commits cleaner and more readable.'
        color: '[AI] `prettyping --color` is a command used in Git, specifically with Prettier, to enable the display of colored output during automated format checks. The `--color` option enables the use of terminal colors for better visual representation of errors and warnings. This can help developers easily identify formatting issues and improve code consistency within a project.'
        columns: '[AI] `prettyping --columns` is a command used in Git, specifically with the `git diff` and `git log` commands, to format and display only specific columns of output. The `--pretty=format:` option is used to customize the output format, and `--columns` specifies which columns to include in the output. For example, `git diff --pretty=format:''%h %s'' --columns=1,3` would display only the commit hash and the message subject for each difference.'
        f: '[AI] The `prettyping -f` command is a subcommand used in Git, specifically with the `git config` and `pretty.format` configuration option. It sets up customized output formats for Git''s commit messages when using commands like `git log` or `git merge`. By adding `-f`, force flag is used to override any existing pretty format configuration without asking for confirmation.'
        last: '[AI] The `prettyping --last` command is a Git alias used to display the prettified format of the last commit message in the current branch. It is commonly used for quickly checking or reviewing the most recent commit message without having to navigate to the commit history in the terminal or an external Git GUI tool. This can be helpful when making multiple commits in a row and wanting to ensure consistency or clarity in the commit messages. The `prettyping` part refers to using a custom commit message format, and `--last` specifies that only the most recent commit should be displayed.'
        legend: '[AI] The `--legend` option in the `prettyping` command is used to display a key or legend along with the formatted output. This legend explains each symbol and its corresponding meaning within the given Git history visualization or diff representation. By default, `prettyping` does not show the legend, but using this option will display it alongside the output for better understanding of the represented data.'
        lines: '[AI] The `--lines` option in the `prettyping` command is used to format output as a series of distinct lines instead of a single, formatted string. This is particularly useful when working with large amounts of data or when debugging, as each line can be inspected individually. When combined with other formatting tools like `yargs`, `prettyping --lines` makes it easy to parse and manipulate complex output data in the terminal.'
        multicolor: '[AI] The `--multicolor` flag in the `prettyping` Git configuration option is used to enable multicolor output when displaying Git branch names in terminal or console. This means that branches with local changes will be displayed with a different color than branches without local changes, making it easier to identify which branches have uncommitted modifications. It''s an optional feature that can help improve the visual representation of Git branches.'
        nocolor: '[AI] The `--nocolor` flag used with `prettyping` in Git is for disabling colored output. `prettyping` is a Git configuration that changes the way Git presents the output of certain commands, making it more readable and user-friendly. With the `--nocolor` flag, this enhanced formatting is disabled, and all output will be displayed in plain text without any colors.'
        nolegend: '[AI] The `prettyping --nolegend` command is used in Git to format and display pretty-printed Git commit messages without showing the abbreviated commit hashes or the ref names in the output. In other words, it only shows the commit messages and author details but omits the legend (commit hash, ref, and parent hashes) from the display.'
        nomulticolor: '[AI] The `--nomulticolor` option in the `prettyping` Git configuration command disables the multicolor pager for Git''s diff, log, and blame commands. When enabled by default, multicolor pagers display differences between files with different colors for each context (added, modified, or deleted lines). Using `--nomulticolor` will make the output use only one color (usually red for deleted lines and green for added lines) or no color at all, depending on the terminal''s capabilities.'
        noterminal: '[AI] `prettyping --no-terminal` is a command used in Git to configure how Git handles terminal output for various operations such as `git log`, `git diff`, etc. By adding the `--no-terminal` option, Git will prevent the output from being styled or colored. This can be useful when working in text editors or non-graphical terminals that don''t support colorization. In contrast, without this flag, Git will apply terminal colors and other formatting to make the output easier to read in a standard terminal environment.'
        nounicode: |-
            [AI] The `prettyping --nounicode` command is not a standard flag or command in any widely-used programming language or tool that I'm aware of. It seems to be specific to the Prettier formatting engine for code, which can be configured using a `.prettierrc` file or through command line options.

            The `--nounicode` option is used to instruct Prettier to parse Unicode characters as code tokens rather than treating them as literals. This is useful when working with source code files that contain non-ASCII characters, such as those commonly used in various programming languages like Japanese, Chinese, or Korean. By enabling `--nounicode`, Prettier will correctly interpret these characters and preserve their meaning during the formatting process, ensuring consistent code style across the project.
        pingbin: '[AI] The `--pingbin` flag is used with the `prettyping` command in Git, specifically for the `git push` or `git pull` commands. This flag modifies the output format of the ping-pong merges, which are conflicts that occur when pushing or pulling changes to a branch where both local and remote branches have conflicting commits. With the `--pingbin` flag, Git displays the conflicted files with their corresponding branch names as part of the commit message, making it easier to identify and resolve the conflicts.'
        q: '[AI] The `prettyping -q` command is used in Git, specifically with the `git diff` or `git log` commands, to display the changes or commit messages in a more human-readable format. The `-q` (quiet) flag, however, instructs Git to suppress all non-error messages and only output the difference or commit information itself. In summary, `prettyping -q` is used to display changes or commits in a pretty format while being quiet about any additional messages.'
        rttmax: '[AI] The `--rttmax` option in the `prettyping` command is used to set the maximum Round Trip Time (RTT) threshold for displaying the pretty-printed output of network packet data. Packets with RTT longer than this value will not be displayed, helping to filter out potential stale or lost packets from the output. This option is useful for debugging and analyzing network traffic where only recent or responsive packets are of interest.'
        rttmin: '[AI] `prettyping --rttmin` is a command used in iPerf3, a popular network testing tool. It sets the Pretty Mode option with RTT minimum display. In this mode, iPerf displays statistics for the minimum round-trip time (RTTmin) between two hosts during the network throughput test. This information can be useful to identify potential bottlenecks or latency issues in a network.'
        terminal: '[AI] The `--terminal` flag in Prettier is used to enable the output of formatted code directly in the console or terminal, instead of writing it to a file. When you run your linter or formatter with this flag, the result will be displayed inline, making it useful for quick checks and adjustments within the command-line interface.'
        unicode: '[AI] `prettyping --unicode` is a command-line option for tools like Git or Hub, which deals with text formatting and Diff representation in Unicode encodings. The `--unicode` flag enables the output to be displayed using Unicode characters instead of ASCII representations during merge conflicts or diff comparisons. This can help make the differences clearer and easier to understand when dealing with non-English or special characters.'
        v: '[AI] The `-v` flag used with the `prettyping` command is a debugging flag in Git. It enables verbose mode, which provides detailed output when pushing or pulling commits between repositories. This can be helpful for diagnosing issues during git operations. The `prettyping` command itself is not a standard Git command; it''s typically used as an alias for formatters such as `git push --format-with=pretty.<format>`.'
