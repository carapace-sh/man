        offline: '[AI] `flutter pub get --offline` is a command used in Flutter development to retrieve and install dependencies from the local cache instead of fetching them online. This can be useful when you have limited internet connectivity or want to ensure a consistent build environment without depending on an online connection. When run, it retrieves the required files from the `.dart_tool/cache` directory and resolves any dependencies defined in the `pubspec.yaml` file. The `--offline` flag ensures that Flutter only uses locally cached packages for installing dependencies.'
