name: pause RESOURCE
description: Mark the provided resource as paused
flags:
    --allow-missing-template-keys: If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
    --field-manager=: Name of the manager used to track field ownership.
    --show-managed-fields: If true, keep the managedFields when printing objects in JSON or YAML format.
    --template=: Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
    -R, --recursive: Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
    -f, --filename*=: Filename, directory, or URL to files identifying the resource to get from a server.
    -k, --kustomize=: Process the kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
    -l, --selector=: Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2). Matching objects must satisfy all of the specified label constraints.
    -o, --output=: 'Output format. One of: (json, yaml, name, go-template, go-template-file, template, templatefile, jsonpath, jsonpath-as-json, jsonpath-file).'

    command: |-
        [AI] `kubectl rollout pause` is a command used in Kubernetes to pause a rolling update or deployment. When you apply a new configuration to a Kubernetes deployment, by default, Kubernetes will gradually roll out the changes across your pods, replacing old ones with new ones. However, there might be situations where you'd like to stop this process temporarily.

        The `kubectl rollout pause` command does just that â€“ it stops the ongoing rolling update or deployment and leaves the current state unchanged. You can resume the update later using `kubectl rollout resume`. This command is helpful when you need to address issues during a deployment without interrupting the entire process, allowing you to maintain service availability.
    flag:
        allow-missing-template-keys: '[AI] `kubectl rollout pause` is a command used with Kubernetes to pause a rolling update or deployment. The `--allow-missing-template-keys` flag allows the deployment to continue even if there are missing keys in the template files, which can be helpful when making changes to the configuration files during an ongoing deployment without disrupting the current instance of the application. In summary, this flag enables a more flexible deployment workflow by allowing for updates with incomplete configuration templates.'
        field-manager: '[AI] The `kubectl rollout pause` command is used to pause the deployment or rollout of a Kubernetes resource, such as a Deployment or DaemonSet. This means that no new replicas will be created or old ones will be scaled down. The `--field-manager` flag is optional and specifies the StrategicRollout or BlueGreen field manager to use for the rollout. This flag allows fine-grained control over the canary releasing process when multiple versions of a deployment are managed using different strategies. In summary, the command pauses ongoing deployments or rollouts while the `--field-manager` flag provides additional options for canary releasing strategies.'
        filename: '[AI] `kubectl rollout pause` is a command used with Kubernetes to pause a rolling update or deployment. The `--filename` flag specifies the file containing the deployment configuration. When you run this command, Kubernetes stops deploying new replicas and holds at the current state until you resume the rollout using `kubectl rollout resume`. This can be useful for troubleshooting or making modifications to your application during an update without interrupting users.'
        kustomize: '[AI] `kubectl rollout pause --kustomize` is a command used with Kubernetes and `kubectl`, its command-line interface, to manage deployments and pauses the ongoing rollout process of resources managed by Kustomize. Kustomize is a set of tools for defining, configuring, and managing Kubernetes resources. The `rollout pause` subcommand halts the deployment''s progress at its current state to prevent further changes until explicitly resumed. This command can be useful when you need to make adjustments or investigations during an ongoing rollout.'
        output: '[AI] `kubectl rollout pause` is a command used with Kubernetes and `kubectl`, its primary client, to pause a rolling update or deployment. This means that no new replicas will be created or old ones replaced until you explicitly resume the process with `kubectl rollout resume`. The `--output` option is used to modify the output format of the command''s result. It can take values like json, yaml, or table based on your preference for further processing or analysis of the Kubernetes resources.'
        recursive: '[AI] `kubectl rollout pause --recursive` is a command used in Kubernetes to pause the deployment of resources and their child resources in a recursive manner. When executed, it causes the progress of any ongoing rollouts under the specified namespace to be frozen in place, preventing new replicas from being created or old ones from being terminated. This can be useful when you need to investigate an issue or perform maintenance on the affected resources without impacting their availability. Once you''re ready to continue the deployment, use `kubectl rollout resume` to unpause it.'
        selector: '[AI] `kubectl rollout pause` is a command used with Kubernetes and `kubectl`, its command-line interface, to pause a rolling update or deployment in progress. The `--selector` option specifies the label selector that identifies the affected Deployments, ReplicaSets, or Rollouts. This command halts the update process at the current state, preventing new replicas from being created or old ones being terminated. It can be useful for troubleshooting or making adjustments during an ongoing deployment.'
        show-managed-fields: '[AI] `kubectl rollout pause` is a command used with Kubernetes to pause a rolling update or deployment. The `--show-managed-fields` flag option is used in conjunction with this command to display the fields of the managed objects that will be rolled back to their previous versions when the rollout is paused. This can help provide insight into which parts of the application will be affected by the rollback and can aid in troubleshooting or reverting changes.'
        template: '[AI] `kubectl rollout pause` is a command used in Kubernetes to pause the deployment of a specific replica set or deployment. The `--template` flag, when used with this command, instructs Kubernetes to apply the given YAML template as the new desired state for the current resource, without actually creating or updating it. Instead, it holds the rollout in the paused state, allowing you to make changes to the template before continuing with the deployment. This can be useful when you need to modify the configuration of your application before proceeding with an update.'
