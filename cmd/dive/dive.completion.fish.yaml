flags:
    --no-descriptions: disable completion descriptions
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `dive` command with the completion flag `--complete-with=fish` is used in a Unix or Linux terminal to interact with the `dive` tool, which is a Git repository explorer. This specific usage completes the next command with a fish-compatible autocompletion. It means that when you start typing the name of a branch or a repository after running `dive`, the terminal will suggest possible completions based on your input and the available options. It helps to speed up the workflow by reducing the number of keystrokes required to enter long Git references.'
    flag:
        no-descriptions: '[AI] The `dive completion fish --no-descriptions` flag is used with tools like `fish shell`, a popular alternative to Bash. This flag is passed to `dive`, which is Fish''s package manager, to install packages without displaying descriptions during installation. So, when using this command, the progress bar and other essential information will be shown, but you won''t see any descriptions or explanations of what''s being installed.'
