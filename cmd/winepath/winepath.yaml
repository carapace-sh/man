flags:
    "-0": separate output with \0 character, instead of a newline
    -h, --help: output this help message and exit
    -l, --long: converts the short Windows path of an existing file or directory to the long format
    -s, --short: converts the long Windows path of an existing file or directory to the short format
    -u, --unix: converts a Windows path to a Unix path
    -w, --windows: converts a Unix path to a long Windows path

    command: '[AI] `winepath` is a utility command in WINE (Wine Is Not an Emulator), a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It''s used to resolve a Windows-style absolute or relative path into the corresponding Unix-style path, taking into account the WINEPREFIX environment variable which specifies a custom prefix for WINE installations. This command helps bridge the gap between the different file system conventions in Windows and Unix systems when using WINE to run Windows applications.'
    flag:
        "0": '[AI] `winepath` is a utility in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix-like operating systems. The option `-0` specifies that the command should be run with no symbolic links following. In other words, `winepath -0 <path>` will only return the exact given path without any symbolic links in it.'

            [AI] `winepath` is a command-line utility used in WINE (Wine Is Not an Emulator), a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix-based systems. The `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use the `winepath` command. Here's a brief explanation:

            1. It prints out a usage message, explaining that `winepath` is a script used to find and append the WINEPREFIX and current working directory to Windows application paths.
            2. It lists the available options with their short flags, like `-w` (--wineprefix) and `-p` (--prefixes), which can be used to specify alternative WINEPREFIX directories.
            3. A brief description for each option is provided. For example:
               - `--wineprefix=<path>`: Sets the WINEPREFIX path to the given directory.
               - `--prefixes=<directory>`: Adds a directory to the list of prefixes that will be searched for when finding application paths.
            4. It concludes by giving an example of using the command to find a Windows executable file's corresponding Unix path, such as `$ winepath --wineprefix=$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Windows/notepad.exe`.
        long: '[AI] `winepath --long` is a command used in WINE, an open-source compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The `--long` option specifically displays the full path of all DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) that will be resolved by WINE when launching a Windows application. This can be useful for debugging or understanding the dependency chain of Windows software on Linux.'
        short: '[AI] `winepath --short` is a command-line utility in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix-based systems. This specific command generates a short version of the Windows DLL dependency chain for a given executable file. It outputs only the top-level DLLs required by the application and their respective versions. The goal is to provide a quick overview of the main dependencies without showing an extensive tree of all dependencies and their interrelationships.'
        unix: '[AI] `winepath` is a utility used in WINE, an compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix-based systems. The `--unix` option specifies that only Unix-style paths (no drive letters) should be resolved when translating Windows file and registry paths to their Unix equivalents. This helps ensure that the application runs correctly within the WINE environment, by providing it with valid Unix-style paths.'
        windows: '[AI] `winepath --windows` is a command-line utility used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix-based systems. The `--windows` option instructs Wine to find the executable file using a Windows search path strategy, which includes checking directories like `C:\Windows\System32`. This flag is useful when attempting to run a Windows application whose location isn''t known or easily accessible from the Unix filesystem.'
