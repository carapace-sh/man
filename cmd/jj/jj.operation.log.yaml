documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `jj operation log` command is used in Jira, a project management tool, to view the log of all operations or changes made to an issue, including comments, worklog entries, transitions, and version changes. It helps in tracking the history of modifications for better understanding and accountability.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] The `jj` command with the option `operation log --help` displays the help information for the "operation log" sub-command of Jumpbox (jj), an open-source terminal session manager. This help text explains what the operation log feature does, how to use it, and provides examples and options for filtering and exporting the log data. It is used to view or manage a record of past operations, such as sessions, commands run, and configuration changes within Jumpbox.'
        limit: '[AI] The `jj` command is a tool for filtering and managing logs in Kubernetes. The `--limit` option sets the maximum number of log entries to display when using the `operation log` subcommand. For example, `jj operation log --limit=100` will show the last 100 log entries for a specific resource or component.'
        no-graph: '[AI] The `jj` command is a popular text editor used in Git for interactive rebase sessions. The option `--no-graph` passed to the `operation log` subcommand disables the display of a graphical representation of the commit history during the rebase process. Instead, only the textual output of the commits and their messages will be shown. This can be useful when working with complex or large repositories where the graphical representation may not load properly or take too long to render.'
        template: '[AI] `jj` is a command-line tool for managing Kubernetes logs. The `operation log --template` subcommand generates JSON or YAML templates based on existing log queries. It allows users to save and reuse complex log query definitions as templates, making it easier to apply the same query across multiple logs or environments. Users can specify the output format (JSON or YAML), name the template file, and provide a context in which to evaluate Kubernetes query expressions, such as namespace or labels.'
