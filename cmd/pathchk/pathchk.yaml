description: check whether file names are valid or portable
flags:
    --help: display this help and exit
    --portability: check for all POSIX systems (equivalent to -p -P)
    --version: output version information and exit
    -P: check for empty names and leading "-"
    -p: check for most POSIX systems
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pathchk` command is a utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems used for checking the syntax of system initialization files, such as those found in the `/etc/` directory or the user''s `~/.profile` file. It verifies that the lines in these files are properly formatted according to the shell''s rules, allowing the operating system to read and execute them without errors. This tool can help prevent issues related to incorrect syntax or formatting in these important configuration files.'
    flag:
        P: '[AI] `pathchk -P` is a command in Unix-based systems used to check the validity of a given path, specifically for the presence of any explicit or implicit directories (also known as "components") that are not part of the file system hierarchy. The `-P` option tells the tool to perform this check strictly and only along the established file system hierarchy without following symbolic links. This helps ensure that the path points to an existing file or directory in the filesystem with no skipped or incorrect components.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `pathchk` is a command-line utility used for checking the validity of Linux kernel command-line arguments, also known as "kernel command lines" or "boot arguments." The `--help` option is used to display detailed help information about how to use the `pathchk` command. It provides explanations for all available options and their usage. For instance:

            ```sh
            $ pathchk --help
            Usage: pathchk [OPTIONS] [PATH...]

            Check Linux kernel command-line arguments (boot arguments).

            Options:
              -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
              --version                       Show version information and exit.
              --debug                         Enable debug mode.
              --print-errors-only              Only print errors and exit with non-zero status.
              --no-warnings                   Suppress warning messages.
              --max-depth=DEPTH               Limit recursion depth (default: 256).
              --quiet                         Be quiet and only report errors.
              -v, --verbose                   Print more verbose output.
              -V, --very-verbose              Print very verbose output.
              --no-color                      Disable color output (defaults to auto).
              --skip-invalid                  Skip invalid paths during recursive scanning.
              --path-prefix=PREFIX            Only check paths starting with PREFIX.
              --path-suffix=SUFFIX            Only check paths ending with SUFFIX.
            ```

            In summary, `pathchk --help` provides a detailed explanation of the various options and their usage when using the `pathchk` command to check Linux kernel command lines.
        p: '[AI] The `pathchk` command with the `-p` option is a Unix utility used for checking the validity of file or pathnames. The `-p` flag specifically resolves and simplifies all symbolic links (symlinks) in the given path before performing the check. This means that instead of checking individual symlinks, `pathchk` follows the chain of symlinks to reach the final physical file or directory and validates it. This can help ensure that the file or path being checked exists and is accessible, while also accounting for any symlinked dependencies.'
        portability: '[AI] `pathchk --portability` is a command-line utility from the util-linux project. It''s used to check the portability of Linux system calls and their arguments, specifically those related to file system paths. The tool examines the given path and checks if it conforms to various Linux standards for compatibility across different distributions and versions. The goal is to ensure that paths can be used reliably in scripts and applications, reducing potential issues caused by differences between systems.'
        version: '[AI] `pathchk --version` is a command used in Linux and Unix-based systems to check the version of the `pathchk` utility. When executed, it prints out the version number and other relevant information about the installed `pathchk` software. This can help users determine if they have the latest version or not, and can be useful for troubleshooting and compatibility issues.'
