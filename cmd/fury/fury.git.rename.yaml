        [AI] The `git rename` command is used to rename a file or a directory in your Git repository. Here's how it works:

        1. First, you navigate into your Git working directory.
        2. You run the `git rename <current_file_or_directory> <new_name>`, for instance, `git rename oldfile newfile`.
        3. Git will stage the rename operation, which means it prepares to commit the change. This results in two commits: one to remove the old file or directory, and another to add the new one with the updated name.
        4. You can then commit these changes using `git commit -m "Your message here"`, or you can use `git commit --amend` if you made the rename in the staging area.

        The result is that your file or directory now has a new name within the repository, and the Git history will reflect this change.
