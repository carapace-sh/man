documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint artifact list` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source continuous delivery and deployment tool, to list all the stored artifacts or build outputs associated with a specific Waypoint application. This command helps users to view the available versions of their built artifacts, which can be useful for selecting the desired version for deployment or rollback purposes.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `waypoint artifact list --app` command is used with Waypoint, an open-source Kubernetes application delivery platform. This command lists the artifacts associated with a specific Kubernetes application. The `--app` flag specifies the name of the application for which to retrieve the artifacts. The output will display details such as the artifact name, version, and status.'
        desc: '[AI] The `waypoint` command with the `artifact list --desc` sub-command is used to describe the details of each artifact in a Kubernetes Waypoint, which is a custom resource used for managing continuous delivery workflows in Kubernetes. The description includes information such as the artifact name, the source image or repository, and the output image or container tag that will be built and deployed. It helps users understand the configuration of their Waypoints and manage their deployments effectively.'
        json: '[AI] The `waypoint artifact list --json` command is used in Kubernetes to retrieve a list of artifacts (custom resources or their instances) managed by Waypoint, a GitOps tool for Kubernetes. The `--json` flag indicates that the output should be in JSON format, making it easier for automated processing and parsing. This command provides detailed information about each artifact, including metadata such as name, namespace, creation timestamp, and status.'
        limit: '[AI] The `waypoint artifact list` command in Kubernetes is used to list the available artifacts (custom resources or templates) in a Waypoint project. The `--limit` flag limits the number of artifacts returned in the output. It allows you to specify a maximum number of artifacts to be displayed, making it helpful when dealing with large Waypoint projects where you only need to view a subset of the available artifacts.'
        long-ids: '[AI] The `waypoint artifact list --long-ids` command is used in Kubernetes to display a detailed list of artifacts associated with Waypoints, which are continuous delivery resources in Kubernetes. The `--long-ids` flag ensures that the output includes the full, unique identifiers for each artifact. This can be helpful when working with multiple artifacts and needing to differentiate between them based on their IDs.'
        order-by: '[AI] The `--order-by` option in the `waypoint artifact list` command is used to specify the sorting order for the output of the `waypoint artifact list` command. It takes a string argument, either "Name" or "CreatedAt" indicating whether to sort the list by the names or created timestamps of the artifacts respectively. For example, `waypoint artifact list --order-by Name` will display a list of artifacts sorted in alphabetical order based on their names.'
        physical-state: '[AI] The `--physical-state` option in the `waypoint artifact list` command is used to specify the physical state of an artifact in Google Cloud''s Waypoint configuration management tool. This flag can have one of two values: "present" or "absent". When specifying an expected physical state for an artifact, Waypoint will report whether that state matches the current state during a synchronization run. For example, if you expect a file to be present but it''s absent, Waypoint will mark that as an out-of-sync discrepancy. This flag helps ensure consistency between declared and actual states of your infrastructure artifacts.'
        plain: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint` command in Kubernetes is used for managing continuous delivery workflows, especially for canary releases and rollbacks. The `artifact list` sub-command lists the available artifacts in a given image repository or registry. The option `--plain` is used to output the results in plain text format without any additional formatting or colorization.

            So, the command `waypoint artifact list --plain` will return a simple table with columns such as `Name`, `Digest`, and `Created At` for each available artifact in the specified repository or registry.
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint artifact list` command in Kubernetes is used to list the artifacts of a specific project in Waypoint, an open-source GitOps platform for managing and deploying applications. The `--project` flag is optional but if provided specifies the name of the project whose artifacts are to be listed. This command helps developers and operators to easily view and manage the different versions of their application artifacts within a given project context.'
        state: '[AI] The `waypoint artifact list --state` command is used in Kubernetes to list the current state of all artifacts managed by Waypoint, which is a GitOps tool for managing Kubernetes applications. The output will show the name, namespace, and status (ready or not ready) of each artifact. This command can be useful for checking the health and readiness of your application artifacts in your Kubernetes cluster.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `waypoint` command with the option `artifact list --verbose` is used in Kubernetes to list all the artifacts (custom resources and their associated metadata) defined in a Waypoint project. The `--verbose` flag increases the output detail, providing more information about each artifact such as its kind, name, and status.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint artifact list --workspace` command in Waypoint, an open-source Kubernetes application delivery platform, lists the artifacts (built Docker images or other output from a build process) that exist within the current Waypoint workspace. This command provides metadata about each artifact, such as its name, tag, and size. It is commonly used to verify which artifacts have been built or are available for deployment in a given workspace.'
        workspace-all: '[AI] The `waypoint` command with the argument `artifact list --workspace-all` is used in the Google Cloud Platform''s `kubectl`-like tool for managing Kubernetes clusters called `GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)`. This specific command generates a list of all artifacts, which are customizable resource configurations, across all workspaces in the current project. Workspaces allow organizing and managing multiple sets of configurations and resources separately within the same project.'
