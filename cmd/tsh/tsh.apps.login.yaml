documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tsh apps login` command is used in the Tenable Security Center''s Tenable Security Platform (TSH) to start an interactive session with a Tenable application, such as Nessus or Log Correlation Engine (LCE), using their web interfaces. It establishes an encrypted SSH tunnel and opens a new terminal window where you can enter the credentials for the target system or application to log in and interact with it directly from the command line.'
    flag:
        aws-role: '[AI] The `tsh apps login --aws-role` command is used in Temporal Workflow, an open-source platform for building and operating workflows, to authenticate and assume an AWS IAM Role using the Temporal CLI (Command Line Interface). When you run this command, it opens a browser window where you grant permissions to Temporal to assume the specified role. Once granted, Temporal can make API calls on your behalf using the assumed IAM role''s permissions. This is useful for securing access to AWS resources when running workflows in a distributed environment.'
        azure-identity: '[AI] `tsh apps login --azure-identity` is a command used in the Azure DevOps Toolset (such as TFS CLI or tsh) to authenticate and log in to an Azure DevOps organization or project collection using Azure Identity (Managed Personal Access Tokens). This method of authentication allows for automated access without exposing credentials, making it suitable for use in scripts and continuous integration/continuous delivery pipelines.'
        cluster: '[AI] `tsh apps login --cluster` is a command used in Tenable.sc (SecurityCenter) to authenticate and gain access to a Tenable Cloud platform, specifically to a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. This command interacts with the Tenable.sc interface by using the Tenable Security Center Tools (TSH), which is a unified command-line interface for multiple Tenable products. The `--cluster` flag signifies that this command will be used to manage and interact with a cluster environment, rather than an individual host or application.'
        gcp-service-account: |-
            [AI] `tsh` is the Tanzu Service Mesh by Istio CLI tool. The command `tsh apps login --gcp-service-account` is used to authenticate and log in to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment using a Service Account key file.

            This command connects your local Tanzu Service Mesh installation to the specified GCP project, allowing you to manage resources such as VirtualServices, DestinationRules, and Gateways within that project. The `--gcp-service-account` flag is followed by the path to the JSON key file of the Service Account, which has the necessary permissions for managing these resources in GCP.
        no-quiet: |-
            [AI] The `tsh` (Telnet and Secure Shell) command with the argument `apps login --no-quiet` is used to start a TSH session for logging into an application server or a remote system via SSH, specifically requesting non-quiet mode.

            In non-quiet mode, detailed information about the connection process is displayed, including progress indicators and debug messages, which can be helpful for troubleshooting or understanding what's happening during the session establishment. If the `--quiet` flag was used instead, the output would be minimal and silent.
        quiet: '[AI] The `tsh` command with the option `apps login --quiet` is used to log into a remote server or application through the Tight Security Shell (TSH) with minimum output or noise in the terminal. The `--quiet` flag suppresses informational messages during the login process, providing a more streamlined and quieter experience for the user.'
