documentation:
    command: '[AI] `ftp` is a command used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems to establish a connection to a remote File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. It allows users to upload, download, and manage files on the remote server as if they were local. The command opens an FTP client application from the terminal interface, where the user can input the server address, login credentials, and file transfer commands like `ls` (list), `get` (download), `put` (upload), and `quit` to disconnect once finished.'
    flag:
        active: '[AI] The `--active` option in FTP (File Transfer Protocol) commands refers to the passive mode of data transfer. In active mode, the FTP client initiates both control and data connections to the server, while in passive mode, the FTP server initiates the data connection, and the client provides the server with a port number to use. This can be useful when the client is behind a firewall or NAT that doesn''t permit incoming connections. The `ftp --active` command would be used to specify active FTP mode during the FTP session.'
        debug: '[AI] The `ftp` command with the `--debug` option is used to run an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) session with enhanced debugging output. This means that detailed information about the FTP commands and their responses will be printed to the terminal, helping to diagnose potential issues during file transfers or connection setup between an FTP client and server.'
        help: '[AI] `ftp --help` is a command used in Unix-based systems to display help information about using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client. When you run this command in a terminal or command prompt, it will show you detailed usage instructions and available options for connecting to an FTP server and transferring files between local and remote systems. It provides essential information on how to authenticate, navigate the file system, and execute common FTP commands like `ls`, `get`, `put`, and `mget`.'
        ipv4: '[AI] The `ftp` command is a utility used to transfer files between a local and a remote system using File Transfer Protocol (FTP). The option `--ipv4` specifies that the FTP client should use IPv4 addresses for connecting to the remote server instead of IPv6. This option is typically used when communicating with servers that only support IPv4 or in environments where IPv4 addressing is preferred over IPv6.'
        ipv6: '[AI] `ftp` is a common command-line file transfer protocol client used to access and transfer files over a network. The option `--ipv6` enables IPv6 support in the FTP client, allowing it to establish connections using IPv6 addresses instead of IPv4 addresses. This can be important when working with networks or servers that exclusively use IPv6 addressing.'
        netrc: '[AI] The `ftp --netrc` command is used in Unix-based systems to transfer files using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), with the option to load the user''s `~/.netrc` file for automatic authentication. This file stores FTP host names, usernames, passwords, and, if set, default local and remote directories. The command `ftp --netrc <hostname>` will connect to the specified FTP server using the information from the `~/.netrc` file, making it more convenient for users who frequently access the same servers.'
        no-edit: '[AI] The `ftp` command with the option `--no-edit` is used in file transfer protocol (FTP) sessions to prevent the automatic editing of local files before they are uploaded or downloaded. When this flag is set, any text files that are transferred maintain their original contents and do not undergo any modifications during the FTP session. This can be beneficial when dealing with sensitive files or when it''s important to preserve the exact state of a file.'
        no-glob: '[AI] The `--no-glob` option in an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) command refers to disabling the expansion of wildcard characters (globs) during a file transfer or command execution on the remote server. In other words, it prevents the FTP client from interpreting and expanding special characters such as `*` or `?` present in filenames before sending the commands to the server. This can be useful when working with filenames containing wildcards on the local machine but wanting to ensure that exact matches are used for the remote file transfers or commands.'
        no-login: '[AI] The `ftp` command with the option `--no-login` is used to initiate an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) session without logging in to a remote server. This can be useful for certain automation tasks, such as transferring files between servers without requiring interactive input. In this mode, the user needs to manually establish the connection and data channel using other methods, like `ftp -i <host>`, before issuing FTP commands for file transfers. However, it''s important to note that not all FTP servers support this usage and it might require additional configuration on both client and server sides.'
        no-prompt: '[AI] The `ftp` command with the option `--no-prompt` is used in Unix-like operating systems to initiate a file transfer protocol session without being prompted for confirmation of each action. This can be convenient for automating FTP tasks through scripts or batch processes, as it eliminates the need for manual user interaction. The command line might look like: `ftp --no-prompt <host> <username> <password>`. Remember to replace `<host>`, `<username>` and `<password>` with the appropriate values.'
        passive: '[AI] The `--passive` option in FTP (File Transfer Protocol) commands enables Passive Mode transfer. In this mode, instead of the FTP client actively initiating a connection to the remote server for data transfers, the server will provide an available data port number which the client then uses for data connection. This can be useful in certain network configurations, such as when the FTP client is behind a NAT (Network Address Translation) device or firewall, and needs to accept incoming connections rather than initiating them.'
        prompt: '[AI] The `ftp` command with the `--prompt` option is used in Unix-like operating systems to initiate a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) session, where the FTP client program runs in non-interactive mode. In this mode, the client does not display any prompts or messages during the data transfer process and instead focuses on sending or receiving files automatically based on given commands. The primary advantage of using `--prompt` is for scripting and automation purposes.'
        trace: '[AI] `ftp --trace` is a command-line option for the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client. It instructs the FTP client to print out each command and response it sends and receives during the FTP session, providing a detailed log of the data transfer process. This can be useful for troubleshooting connectivity issues or for understanding the underlying FTP protocol interactions between the client and server.'
        usage: '[AI] `ftp --usage` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to display help or usage information about the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client utility. When executed with this argument, it provides a brief summary of how to use the FTP client to connect and transfer files between local and remote servers. The output includes information on syntax, options, and examples.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `ftp` command with the `--verbose` option is used in File Transfer Protocol (FTP) file transfers to increase the amount of output or feedback displayed during the transfer process. This can be helpful for debugging FTP sessions, as it provides more detailed information about each command sent and the corresponding response from the server. The verbose mode displays all FTP commands and their responses, giving a clearer view of what is happening during the file transfer.'
        version: '[AI] `ftp --version` is a command used in Unix or Unix-like operating systems to display information about the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client being utilized. This command returns output containing the name of the FTP client software, its version number, and sometimes additional details such as the operating system it was built for and any relevant compilation options. The primary purpose is to provide users with up-to-date information on their FTP client''s status, helping them identify whether they have the latest available version or not.'
