name: front-proxy-ca
description: Generate the self-signed CA to provision identities for front proxy
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save and store the certificates.
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubernetes-version=: Choose a specific Kubernetes version for the control plane.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm init` command with the specified argument, `phase certs front-proxy-ca`, is used to generate and configure TLS certificates for the front-proxy component in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. This component enables secure communication between external clients and the Kubernetes API server through an ingress controller like MetalLB or Traefik. This command is typically executed as part of setting up a new Kubernetes cluster with Kubeadm for the first time.'

        cert-dir: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The option `phase certs front-proxy-ca --cert-dir` is used during the initialization process to configure the certificate authorities (CAs) for the front-proxy component.

            Front-proxy is an optional feature in Kubernetes that provides secure communication between the API server and etcd, as well as external clients. It acts as a reverse proxy for the Kubernetes API server.

            The `--cert-dir` argument specifies the directory where the front-proxy CA certificates will be saved. These certificates are used to sign the client certificates that are issued to external clients communicating with the cluster through the front-proxy. The `init` process generates these CA certificates and saves them in the specified directory for later use.
        config: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase certs front-proxy-ca --config` option is used during the initialization process to create and configure the Certificate Authority (CA) for the front-proxy client certificates. These certificates are required for communication between the Kubernetes API server and clients that act as proxies, such as MetalLB or Traefik. The `--config` flag specifies a file containing custom configurations for this CA generation process.'
        kubernetes-version: '[AI] The `kubeadm init` command is used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The specific option `phase certs front-proxy-ca --kubernetes-version` instructs `kubeadm` to generate and output the certificate authorities (CAs) for the front-proxy client certificate manager, specifically for the version of Kubernetes specified by `--kubernetes-version`. These CAs are necessary for secure communication between the cluster components and external clients that use the front-proxy to access the cluster''s services.'
