            [AI] `mdbook clean` is a command used in the Mdbook documentation builder. The `--help` option provides information on how to use this command with various options. Here's a brief explanation:

            `mdbook clean` is for removing unnecessary files and caches created during the build process, such as HTML output files. This can help save disk space or speed up the next build by not needing to regenerate these files.

            The `--help` option displays detailed usage information including options that can be passed to this command:

            - `--force`: Overwrites existing output files without asking for confirmation
            - `--quiet`: Suppress progress messages during cleaning. Useful for scripts and automated builds.

            You can run the command as `mdbook clean --help` to get more information on usage.
        version: '[AI] `mdbook clean --version` is a command used in the Mdbook documentation builder. The `clean` sub-command is responsible for removing the generated output files, while the `--version` option displays the version number of the Mdbook tool being used. So, this command will display the Mdbook version and then clean previously generated output files.'
