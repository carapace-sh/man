    command: '[AI] The `rustup self uninstall` command is used in Rust programming language to remove the currently installed Rust toolchain and its components, such as the Rust compiler (rustc), Cargo build tool, and documentation. This operation can be useful when you want to switch to a different version or configuration of Rust tools, or when troubleshooting issues related to your Rust environment. Keep in mind that uninstalling the default toolchain may affect the functionality of some Rust projects that rely on specific features or dependencies.'

        help: |-
            [AI] `rustup self uninstall` is a Rust tool command for uninstalling the currently active Rust toolchain and installer, Rustup, from your system. The `--help` option provides detailed information about how to use this command effectively. Here's a brief summary:

            - Uninstalls the currently active Rust toolchain and Rustup setup on your system
            - Does not affect other toolchains or installations if multiple exist
            - Can be run with `--force` flag to delete associated configuration files, caches, etc.
            - Run `rustup uninstall default` instead if you want to remove the default toolchain without affecting Rustup itself

            Usage: `rustup self uninstall --help` or `rustup self uninstall --help --force`.
        "y": '[AI] `rustup self uninstall -y` is a Rust package manager command used to uninstall the currently active Rust toolchain and default components. The `-y` flag implies yes to all prompts, making the operation automatic without user intervention. This command does not uninstall other installed toolchains or components unless explicitly specified with additional flags.'
