documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tsh mfa` command is used in Tenable Security Center to manage Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) settings for users or groups. It can be used to enable, disable, or modify MFA policies. For example, `tsh mfa enable user username` enables MFA for the specified user account, while `tsh mfa policy group groupname set MANDATORY` sets the MFA policy for the named group to require two-factor authentication. Other options allow configuring which types of MFA methods are allowed or setting exceptions.'
