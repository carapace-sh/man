Completion here refers to the degree to which an agent is set up and ready to send data to New Relic for monitoring. The command displays information about each agent, including its name, version, and completion status, enabling users to quickly identify any issues that need attention.'

            [AI] The `newrelic completion --shell` command is used to install and configure the New Relic CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for Ruby and Node.js applications, specifically for the shell environment.

            The `--shell` flag indicates that the installation process should include setting up auto-completion for your shell (like Bash or Zsh). Once installed, you can enjoy enhanced interactivity while working with New Relic in your terminal, such as tab completion and suggested commands.
