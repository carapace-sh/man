    command: "[AI] The `npm access restricted` command is not a valid npm (Node Package Manager) command. It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a typo in the given command. \n\nIn general, `npm access` is a command used by npm to manage access to published packages. Specifically, it's used to grant or revoke publish permissions for certain scopes in an npm registry. For example, one could use `npm access add <user> <scope>` to give someone publish permissions for a specific scope (e.g., `myorg:my-package`) within your organization.\n\nIf you meant to restrict or limit the access of a user, you might consider using other npm features like fine-grained access control in your organization's npm registry settings or using role-based access control tools such as TeamCity, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions to manage your npm publishing process."
