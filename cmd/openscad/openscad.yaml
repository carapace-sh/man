    command: '[AI] OpenSCAD is not a command but a software tool for creating solid 3D CAD models. It uses its own description language (OpenSCAD Scripting Language) to define objects, which are then rendered in real-time as the script is executed. It''s popularly used for generating STL files for 3D printing and other rapid prototyping processes due to its efficiency in handling large and complex models.'
    flag:
        D: '[AI] `--D` is a command-line option for OpenSCAD, a parametric 3D CAD software. This option is used to enable or disable specific features or options at compile time without modifying the source code directly. By passing `--D<option>`, you can enable or disable the corresponding feature or option during the compilation process. For instance, `--DDEBUG` may turn on additional debugging information or `--DCHECK_BOUNDARIES` may enforce boundary checking. The specific effect depends on the option used.'
        P: '[AI] The `--P` option in OpenSCAD is used to pass parameters from the command line to the script or document being processed. These parameters can be accessed and used within OpenSCAD code using the `params.xxx` syntax, where `xxx` is the name of the parameter as specified on the command line. This allows for customizing the output of OpenSCAD based on input arguments.'
        autocenter: '[AI] `openscad --autocenter` is a command-line option for OpenSCAD, a parametric 3D CAD software. It automatically centers the bounding box of the geometry being created around the origin (0,0,0) of the coordinate system during rendering or exporting the STL file. This can be useful when dealing with complex models that may not have an obvious center of mass or symmetry. By using `--autocenter`, the resulting model will be centered in the output file or viewport for easier handling and manipulation.'
        camera: '[AI] `openscad --camera` is a command-line option for OpenSCAD, a parametric 3D modeling software. This option switches the rendering mode to "camera," which allows users to generate images from specific viewpoints and angles, even if there are no defined cameras in the script or the scene. The resulting output is an image file that can be saved and used for visualization purposes.'
        check-parameter-ranges: '[AI] The `--check-parameter-ranges` flag in OpenSCAD is used to perform a parameter range check during compilation. This means that OpenSCAD will verify if all the parameters used in the script are within their defined ranges before executing the code. This can help prevent errors and ensure consistent results by catching potential issues early in the design process.'
        check-parameters: '[AI] `openscad --check-parameters` is a command-line option used with OpenSCAD, a software for creating solid 3D CAD models. This option is used to verify the correctness of the given parameters in an OpenSCAD script file without actually generating any output. It checks the syntax and type compatibility of the parameters and reports any errors or warnings, helping users to prevent potential issues before running the script to generate the final 3D model.'
        colorscheme: '[AI] The `--colorscheme` option in OpenSCAD is used to specify a color scheme for the generated 3D models. It allows users to customize how different parts or objects are rendered by assigning specific colors to them. This can be useful for enhancing visual understanding of complex models, improving the aesthetics of the output, or facilitating easier identification and distinction between various elements within the model. The color scheme can be defined using a file in JSON format or by explicitly specifying individual color assignments via the command line.'
        csglimit: '[AI] `openscad --csglimit` is a command-line argument for OpenSCAD, a parametric 3D CAD software. The `--csglimit` option sets a limit on the maximum size of CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) operations in terms of memory usage or number of boolean operations. By default, OpenSCAD does not have any limit, and setting this argument helps prevent potential out-of-memory errors or excessive computation time when dealing with complex CSG models.'
        d: '[AI] `--d` is a command-line option for OpenSCAD, a parametric 3D CAD software. It stands for "draw" or "display" mode. When used, OpenSCAD will not save the output as an STL or other file format but instead displays the generated 3D model in real-time in its graphical user interface (GUI) or console window. This can be helpful for testing and debugging 3D models on the fly without having to save and load files repeatedly.'
        debug: '[AI] `openscad --debug` is a command-line argument used with OpenSCAD, a popular 3D CAD software for creating solid 3D models. This argument enables the comprehensive output of debugging information during the compilation of OpenSCAD scripts into 3D models. The debug mode provides more detailed and extensive feedback, helping developers identify issues or errors in their code, including parsing mistakes, compiler warnings, and other runtime problems. It''s a useful tool for advanced users and developers to improve their OpenSCAD scripts and understand the underlying workings of the software.'
        hardwarnings: '[AI] The `--hardwarnings` flag in OpenSCAD is used to enable strict warning messages during compilation. With this option, OpenSCAD will display more detailed and specific warnings for potential issues in your script or model file. These warnings are not just suggestions but indicate possible errors that might prevent successful compilation of the file. It''s important to address these warnings as they may impact the correctness and performance of the final output from OpenSCAD.'
        help: '[AI] `openscad --help` is a command used in OpenSCAD, a software for creating solid 3D CAD models. When executed, it displays detailed information about how to use OpenSCAD from the command line. The output includes available commands and their usage, options to control various aspects of the OpenSCAD build process, and information on how to interact with the program''s scripting interface. It is a useful resource for users looking to learn more about OpenSCAD or troubleshoot issues with specific commands.'
        imgsize: '[AI] The `--imgsize` option in OpenSCAD is used to specify the size of the output image generated by the `render` or `export_png` commands. It takes an argument representing the width and height of the image in pixels, for example, `--imgsize 300x200`. This ensures that the generated image matches the specified dimensions.'
        info: '[AI] `openscad --info` is a command used in OpenSCAD, a software for creating solid 3D CAD models. This command displays detailed information about the installed version of OpenSCAD, including the version number, build date, operating system, and compiler used. It also shows the location of various configuration files and directories related to OpenSCAD. The output can be useful for troubleshooting issues or for ensuring that you have a compatible version of OpenSCAD for a specific project.'
        m: '[AI] The `--m` option in OpenSCAD is used to load external MCode files during the compilation process. MCode are pre-processed instructions specific to OpenSCAD that can be used for various purposes, such as defining custom functions or creating complex geometries. By using the `--m` flag followed by the path to an MCode file, you can incorporate these custom instructions into your OpenSCAD script and expand the capabilities of your designs.'
        o: '[AI] `openscad --o` is a command-line option used with OpenSCAD, a software for creating solid 3D CAD models. The `--o` (or `-out`) flag is followed by the output file name specification where the generated STL or other supported format file will be saved. For instance, `openscad myfile.scad --o output.stl` would generate an STL file named "output.stl" from the OpenSCAD script file "myfile.scad".'
        p: '[AI] `--p` is a command-line option for OpenSCAD, a parametric 3D CAD software. It stands for "parameter file," and its purpose is to load external parameter files (with a .par extension) containing custom parameters that can be used to modify the behavior or appearance of an OpenSCAD script. This allows users to easily change multiple parameters at once without editing the original script, making it more efficient for complex projects.'
        preview: '[AI] `openscad --preview` is a command used in OpenSCAD, a software for creating solid 3D CAD models. This command starts OpenSCAD in interactive mode with preview function enabled. It allows users to interactively explore the model by rendering and rotating it in real-time, without actually generating STL or other output files. The changes made during this interactive session can be incorporated into the original .scad script file for further modifications.'
        projection: '[AI] `openscad --projection` is a command-line option used with OpenSCAD, a software for creating solid 3D CAD models. This option is used to render the 3D model as a 2D projection, which can be saved as an image file instead of generating a 3D STL or other format. The projection type can be specified using additional parameters like `--orthographic` (produces an orthographic projection) or `--perspective` (produces a perspective projection). These projections help to visualize and present the model from different viewpoints as 2D images, which can be useful for documentation, presentations, or communication with collaborators.'
        quiet: '[AI] `openscad --quiet` is a command-line option for OpenSCAD, a software for creating solid 3D CAD models. The option `--quiet` suppresses most of the output messages that OpenSCAD usually generates during its execution, providing a quiet or silent build process. This can be useful when running scripts or large projects where you want to minimize console noise and focus on the final result.'
        render: '[AI] `openscad --render` is a command-line option used in OpenSCAD, a software for creating solid 3D CAD models. This option instructs OpenSCAD to render and export a 2D or 3D image of the current design based on the active camera view or a defined perspective. The resulting image can be saved as various file formats like PNG, JPG, SVG, or PDF for further processing or sharing purposes. It does not involve any modification of the SCAD code but rather generates a visualization of the current design state.'
        version: '[AI] `openscad --version` is a command used in OpenSCAD, a software for creating solid 3D CAD models. This command is executed in the terminal or command prompt to display the version information of the installed OpenSCAD system. The output will show the version number, build number, and compilation date, providing important details about the specific instance of OpenSCAD being used.'
        view: '[AI] `openscad --view` is a command used in OpenSCAD, a software for creating solid 3D CAD models. This command is used to open an existing OpenSCAD script file and display the 3D model in a viewer instead of generating an STL or other output files. The flag `--view` instructs OpenSCAD to only render the model in the graphical user interface for visualization purposes. It''s useful for making adjustments to your design interactively without having to generate new output files each time.'
        viewall: '[AI] `openscad --viewall` is a command used in OpenSCAD, a software for creating solid 3D CAD models. This command is not actually a part of the OpenSCAD flag system but rather a script or batch file instruction. It''s typically included in scripts to compile and render all files within a specified directory using OpenSCAD. The `--viewall` argument itself doesn''t have any specific function; it''s just a helpful label for bundling multiple individual OpenSCAD commands into one script, making the process of compiling and rendering multiple files more convenient.'
