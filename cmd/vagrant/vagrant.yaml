    command: '[AI] Vagrant is a software provisioning tool for managing and configuring virtual machines (VMs) and other types of environments. It uses files called Vagrantfiles to define machine configurations, allowing users to easily create, customize, and manage environments for development, testing, and deployment. With Vagrant, you can automate the process of bootstrapping new projects, including setting up the operating system, installing software packages, and configuring applications. It supports multiple virtualization providers like VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V, and Docker, enabling portability and flexibility in your environment setup.'
