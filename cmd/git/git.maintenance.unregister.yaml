description: Remove the current repository from background maintenance
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `git maintenance unlock` or `git maintenance unregister` command is used to remove a Git tag that was registered as a release or maintenance branch with Git''s built-in maintenance mode feature. This command should be run in the repository where the tag was created and registered, and it removes any special designation of the tag as a maintenance branch, allowing regular git tagging operations without affecting the maintenance branch.'
