    command: '[AI] `pulumi policy disable` is a command used in Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform, to disable specific policies defined for a resource or a stack. Policies are rules that can be set to enforce desirable behaviors and prevent unwanted changes. By disabling a policy, you bypass its restrictions temporarily or permanently depending on the configuration. This command helps in managing your infrastructure with more flexibility while ensuring compliance through selective use of policies.'
