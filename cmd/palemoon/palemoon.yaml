documentation:
    command: '[AI] "Palemoon" is not a recognized command in computer programming or common operating systems. It appears to be a misspelling of "Pale Moon," an open-source web browser based on the Mozilla Gecko platform, which is an alternative to Firefox with a focus on smaller size and reduced memory consumption.'
    flag:
        P: '[AI] `palemoon` is not a flag but a command for running the Portable Firefox browser. The option `-P` sets up or specifies a profile for Portable Firefox to use, allowing users to keep separate configurations, bookmarks, and data for different browsing sessions. This can be useful for maintaining multiple user profiles on a single computer or when using public computers.'
        ProfileManager: '[AI] `palemoon --ProfileManager` is a command-line argument used with the Palemoon browser, a lightweight and customizable version of Firefox. The argument invokes the Profile Manager tool, which allows users to manage multiple profiles within Palemoon. Each profile can have its own settings, extensions, bookmarks, and browsing data. Using `--ProfileManager` helps in organizing user data, troubleshooting issues, or maintaining different configurations for various tasks.'
        UILocale: '[AI] The `--UILocale` flag in Palemoon, a customized version of the Firefox web browser, is used to specify the user interface locale for the browser. This means that when you run Palemoon with this flag followed by a language code (e.g., `--UILocale en-US`), it will display its graphical user interface in that particular language and regional format. It enhances the user experience by making the browser''s menus, buttons, and other text align with the specified locale.'
        browser: '[AI] `palemoon` is not a flag but rather an open-source web browser based on Mozilla Firefox, with a focus on minimalism and customizability. The command `--browser palemoon` is typically used in the context of a terminal or command line interface, indicating that Palemoon should be launched as the default web browser when opening URLs or interacting with other applications. For example, on Linux distributions, you can set Palemoon as your default browser by modifying environment variables or using desktop shortcuts configured with this flag.'
        browserconsole: '[AI] The `palemoon --browserconsole` command is used to launch the Palemoon browser with the Browser Console enabled. Palemoon is a lightweight and customizable version of Mozilla Firefox. By enabling the Browser Console, developers can interactively test and manipulate JavaScript code in the context of a webpage loaded in the browser. This can be helpful for debugging, exploring web technologies, or testing client-side functionality. The `--browserconsole` flag ensures this feature is activated upon launching the browser.'
        devtools: |-
            [AI] The `palemoon --devtools` command is used to launch the Firefox development version, specifically with the DevTools enabled. Here's a brief explanation:

            `palemoon` is a command-line interface for the Firefox web browser, often used in operating systems where Firefox isn't installed as a native application. `--devtools` is an option that gets passed to this command. It instructs Firefox to open its built-in Developer Tools when the browser window is launched. These tools offer advanced features for debugging, inspecting web pages, and modifying live content, making it an essential part of any web developer's toolkit.
        display: |-
            [AI] The `--display` option in the Palemoon command line is used to specify the X11 display where Palemoon should open its graphical user interface (GUI). This option is necessary when running Palemoon in a headless or non-interactive environment, such as on a server or in a script.

            The argument to `--display` should be the name of an X11 display, typically in the format `:0.0` for the first display on the local machine, `:0.1` for the second display, and so on. If Palemoon is being run on a remote machine via SSH, the display argument may include the hostname or IP address of the machine running the X11 server, such as `hostname:0.0`.

            By default, Palemoon will attempt to use the local display (`:0.0`) if no display argument is provided. If an invalid display name is specified, Palemoon will return an error and will not start up.
        g-fatal-warnings: '[AI] The `--g-fatal-warnings` flag for Palemoon (a variant of Firefox) is used to enable strict warning checking during browser startup and command line script execution. It causes the browser to exit immediately if any non-fatal warnings are encountered, making it a useful option for automated testing or debugging scenarios where only errors should be allowed.'
        help: '[AI] The command `palemoon --help` in a terminal or command prompt is used to display a help message about the Palemoon browser, which is a version of Mozilla Firefox with a focus on performance and minimalism. This help message provides an overview of Palemoon''s usage, including available command-line options for launching it with custom settings, profiles, or additional arguments. Some common options include opening a specific URL, using a custom user agent string, or starting in offline mode. For detailed information on each option, refer to the displayed help message.'
        jsconsole: '[AI] The command `palemoon --jsconsole` is used to launch the Palemoon browser with the JavaScript Console enabled. The JavaScript Console is a debugging tool that allows users to interactively execute JavaScript code in the context of a web page loaded in the browser. This can be useful for troubleshooting, experimentation, and testing purposes. When using this command to start the browser, a new instance of Palemoon will open with an active JavaScript Console ready for use.'
        jsdebugger: '[AI] `palemoon` is not a known command or flag in standard usage. It seems to be a typo and intended to be `firefox`, which is a popular web browser. The `--jsdebugger` flag is specific to Firefox''s Developer Edition and enables the JavaScript Debugger by default when opening the developer tools. This can aid in debugging complex JavaScript issues within web pages.'
        new-instance: '[AI] `palemoon --new-instance` is a command-line option for the Palemoon browser (a version of Firefox). It opens a new instance of the browser with a fresh profile, meaning no previously saved cookies, saved passwords, or other user data will be loaded. This can help maintain privacy and security by preventing the transfer of sensitive information between browsing sessions.'
        new-tab: '[AI] The command `palemoon --new-tab` is used to open a new tab in the Palemoon browser with an empty URL address bar. Palemoon is a free and open-source web browser based on Mozilla Firefox, but with a smaller footprint and enhanced privacy features. The `--new-tab` option is passed as a command-line argument when launching the browser to create a new tab instance instead of opening a URL in an existing tab or window.'
        new-window: '[AI] `palemoon --new-window` is a command-line argument used with the Palemoon browser to open a new window. The `--new-window` option instructs the browser to launch a fresh instance instead of opening a new tab in an existing window.'
        no-remote: '[AI] `palemoon --no-remote` is a command-line option for the Palemoon browser, a fork of Firefox. The `--no-remote` flag disables the ability to establish a network connection between instances of the browser. This means that each instance runs independently and does not share data or tabs with other instances, providing increased privacy and isolation.'
        preferences: '[AI] `palemoon --preferences` is a command-line argument used with the Palemoon web browser to open its preferences file in a text editor for manual editing. This can be useful for users who want to make advanced customizations not available through the graphical user interface. The changes made in the preferences file will persist across Palemoon sessions until they are overwritten by subsequent edits or by upgrading Palemoon.'
        private-window: '[AI] `palemoon --private-window` is a command-line argument for the Palemoon browser, a open-source web browser derived from Firefox. This argument opens a Private Browsing window. In Private Browsing mode, Palemoon blocks the storage of certain data, such as cookies, site data, and search history, to help enhance privacy while browsing. This feature is useful for preventing others from accessing your browsing history and sensitive information when using public or shared computers.'
        profile: '[AI] The `--profile` option in Palemoon, a lightweight version of Mozilla Firefox, is used to specify which profile to use when starting the browser. A Firefox or Palemoon profile contains user-specific data such as bookmarks, saved passwords, and settings. By default, both browsers use the default profile. However, you can create and manage multiple profiles for different users or usage scenarios. When starting Palemoon with the `--profile` option followed by the path to a specific profile directory, the browser will use that profile instead of the default one.'
        recording: '[AI] The `--recording` flag in Palemoon (a customized version of Mozilla Firefox) is used to enable the built-in web technologies like WebRTC and MediaStream for recording and streaming media content. It''s primarily used for creating and maintaining local or remote recordings, such as video conferencing or screen capturing applications. By activating this flag, additional components are installed or configured that support real-time media handling and data transmission.'
        recording-output: |-
            [AI] `palemoon` is a command-line interface to the Mozilla Firefox web browser using the Portable Application Executable (PAE) format, which allows running applications from a USB drive or other portable media without installing them on the host system.

            The option `--recording-output=<filename>` is used to specify an output file for recording a browser session as a video or animation using tools like `WebMRecord`, `Flashback`, or similar extensions. The recorded content can be saved and shared, enabling the creation of tutorials, demos, or other types of multimedia content based on web browsing activities.
        safe-mode: '[AI] The `--safe-mode` flag in Palemoon, a lightweight version of Firefox, is used to start the browser in a minimal and secure state. It disables all add-ons, extensions, and plugins by default, providing enhanced security as it limits the potential attack surface from third-party software. Additionally, it restricts JavaScript and other potentially risky content, further reducing the chances of vulnerabilities being exploited.'
        search: '[AI] The `--search` flag is a command-line option for the Palemoon web browser, which is a fork of the Firefox browser. This flag is used to open a new tab and perform a search using the given query. When you type `palemoon --search <query>` in the terminal or command prompt, it will launch Palemoon with a blank tab, then automatically execute a search query using your preferred search engine (usually set in browser preferences) for the provided keyword or phrase. It''s an efficient way to quickly perform a web search from the command line without having to open a separate tab or type the search query manually.'
        setDefaultBrowser: '[AI] `palemoon --setDefaultBrowser` is a command-line option for the Palemoon browser. It sets Palemoon as the default web browser on your system, replacing the previous default browser. This means that when you click on URL links or open HTML files outside of the browser, they will automatically open in Palemoon instead.'
        start-debugger-server: '[AI] `palemoon --start-debugger-server` is a command-line argument used with the Palemoon browser, derived from Firefox, to start it with the built-in debugger server enabled. This server allows attaching a debugger (like gdb or Visual Studio''s debugger) to running instances of Palemoon for remote debugging and inspecting JavaScript code in real-time while the browser is executing it. It''s commonly used for advanced web development tasks and debugging complex issues.'
        sync: '[AI] `palemoon --sync` is a command-line option for the Palemoon browser, which is a version of Mozilla Firefox with a focus on performance and customization. The `--sync` flag enables Firefox Sync, a feature that allows users to synchronize their bookmarks, browsing history, passwords, and other preferences across multiple devices. This way, users can access their saved information from any device where they have logged in with their Firefox account.'
        version: '[AI] `palemoon --version` is a command used in the Palemoon browser to display its current version number. The `--version` option is a common argument for various applications and tools, including web browsers, to output their version information as text. When you run this command in the terminal or command prompt, it will print out the major and minor version number of Palemoon, along with any build identification information, such as the compilation date or commit hash. This can be helpful for troubleshooting or for ensuring that you have the latest version of Palemoon installed.'
