    command: '[AI] The `rustup default` command is used to set the active toolchain in Rust''s package manager, Rustup, to a specific toolchain. When you have multiple Rust toolchains installed, using this command allows you to specify which one will be used by default when compiling Rust code without having to specify it each time.'

            [AI] `rustup default` is a Rust tool command used to manage multiple Rust toolchains, which are self-contained environments with different versions of the Rust compiler and its components. The `--help` flag provides information about the specific usage of the `default` subcommand.

            Here's a brief explanation:

            The `rustup default [global|<toolchain>]` command sets the default toolchain for global projects (i.e., projects not located within a Rust project workspace) or for a specified toolchain. The `--help` flag displays detailed help information about this command, including its usage and available options.

            When run with no arguments, the command will set or display the currently active default toolchain.

            You can use the command like this:

            - To display the current default toolchain: `rustup default`
            - To set a new default toolchain (for example, stable): `rustup default stable`

            Additionally, you can remove the default setting by using the global flag: `rustup default none`. This will make Rust look for the toolchains in your system path instead of using any default one.
