            [AI] `hugo mod verify --clean` is a command used in Hugo, a popular static site generator for building websites and blogs. This command is used to ensure the dependencies of a Hugo project are up-to-date and free from any potential security vulnerabilities.

            The `--clean` flag specifically tells Hugo to remove the cache and temporary files before checking for updates, ensuring that the dependency checks start with a clean slate. After running this command, you can be confident that all dependencies in your project are up-to-date and secure.
