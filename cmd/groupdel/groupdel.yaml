documentation:
    command: '[AI] `groupdel` is a Linux command used to delete an existing group in the system. It requires superuser (root) privileges to execute. The syntax is as follows: `groupdel <group-name>`. When executed, all group memberships and associated data related to the specified group are removed. It''s important to note that deleting a group does not automatically delete the user accounts that were members of the group, only the group itself.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `groupdel --force` is a command used in Linux systems for forcefully deleting a group and all its associated memberships. When using this command, there will be no confirmation prompt before executing the deletion. This means that any errors or consequences resulting from the operation will not be prevented, making it a potentially risky command to use if the targeted group has active users or important data associated with it. Use with caution and ensure that the correct group is being deleted to avoid unintended consequences.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `groupdel` is a command in Linux systems used to remove or delete a group with its associated membership and permissions. The `--help` option, when invoked with this command, displays detailed information about how to use it correctly. Here's a brief summary:

            ```
            Usage: groupdel [OPTION]... GROUP

            Remove the named group and all its members, or remove the named group only if --no-users is given.

            Options:
              --help             Display this help message and exit.
              --quiet            Suppress most error messages.
              --no-users         Remove only the group name and not the users that are members of it.
            ```

            In simpler terms, to delete a group named "mygroup," run `groupdel mygroup`. The `--help` option is used when you want more information about how this command can be used, such as available options or usage examples.
        prefix: '[AI] The `groupdel --prefix` command is a Linux utility used to delete multiple groups in a system that have a common prefix in their names. The `--prefix` option specifies the string that is common to the group names to be deleted. For example, `groupdel --prefix="my_"` would delete all groups whose names start with "my\_". This command can save time and effort when dealing with numerous groups that need to be removed for a specific reason.'
        root: '[AI] The `groupdel --root` command is a utility in Linux and Unix-based systems used to delete a group with the given name if it is an empty group, i.e., has no members. The `--root` option specifies that the group to be deleted is the root group (usually referred to as `root` or `grpName:x:`), which cannot be deleted by regular users due to its system significance. The root group manages the ownership of files and directories for all other groups and users in the system. If used without proper authorization, it can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.'
