description: initialize new module in current directory
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `go mod init` is a Go command used to initialize a new Go module by creating a `go.mod` file in the current directory. This file is essential for managing the dependencies of the Go project using Go Mod, which is the default dependency management solution in Go 1.11 and later versions. When you run this command with the name of your module as an argument (e.g., "go mod init mymodule"), it automatically creates or updates the `go.mod` file with the specified module name and sets its import path accordingly. This command helps maintain a clear and consistent dependency tree for your project.'
