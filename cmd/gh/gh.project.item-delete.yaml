        [AI] The `gh project item-delete` command is used to delete an item (such as a file or directory) from a GitHub Project in the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface). Here's how it works:

        1. You need to have the GitHub CLI installed and authenticated with your GitHub account.
        2. Navigate to the local directory containing the GitHub Project repository.
        3. Run the command `gh project get [PROJECT_ID]`, replacing `[PROJECT_ID]` with the actual ID or name of your GitHub Project. This will fetch the Project data locally.
        4. After obtaining the Project data, use the command `gh project item delete [ITEM_PATH] [FILE_NAME]`, where `[ITEM_PATH]` is the relative path to the directory containing the item you want to delete and `[FILE_NAME]` is the name of the file or directory you wish to remove.
        5. The CLI will prompt for confirmation before deleting the item. If you confirm, the specified item will be deleted from the Project in your local repository.
        6. Finally, run `git push origin main` or equivalent branch name to sync the changes with your GitHub remote repository.

            [AI] The `gh project item-delete --format` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to delete an item from a specific GitHub project. Here's a breakdown:

            1. `gh`: This is the GitHub CLI tool, which allows you to interact with GitHub from your terminal or command prompt.
            2. `project`: Specifies that this command relates to managing GitHub projects.
            3. `item-delete`: Indicates the specific action of deleting an item (such as a card, issue, or pull request).
            4. `--format`: This option is used to customize the output format when performing the command. In this case, it's not explicitly stated what the output format will be, so you should consult the official documentation for more information on available formats.
        id: '[AI] The command `gh project item-delete --id <ID>` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to delete an item (such as a branch, tag, or issue) from a GitHub project with a specified ID. The `--id <ID>` argument identifies the specific item to be deleted by providing its unique identifier.'
        jq: '[AI] `gh` is a command-line tool for interacting with GitHub. The given command is using the `gh project` subcommand to manage projects, specifically the `item-delete` action to delete an item. The `--jq` flag indicates that the output of the command should be passed through the `jq` processor, a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor, for further processing and filtering of JSON data.'
        owner: '[AI] The `gh project item-delete --owner` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to delete an item in a specific GitHub project owned by a particular user or organization. The `--owner` flag specifies the owner of the project, and the `item-delete` subcommand deletes the specified project item. This command requires authentication with GitHub and is often used through Git Bash or other terminal applications for managing projects programmatically.'
        template: |-
            [AI] The `gh project item-delete --template` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to delete an item in a GitHub Project using a template file. Here's a brief explanation of each part:

            1. `gh`: This is the name of the GitHub Command Line tool. It allows users to interact with GitHub programmatically from the terminal.
            2. `project`: This specific command is used to manage items within a GitHub Project.
            3. `item-delete`: This subcommand is used to delete an existing project item (issue, pull request, etc.) based on certain conditions.
            4. `--template`: The `--template` option instructs the command to use a template file for defining filters or conditions when selecting items to be deleted.

            In summary, this command lets you delete GitHub Project items by providing a template file that defines the selection criteria.
