documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tofu import` command is not a standard command in any widely used programming language or tool. It seems to be specific to Tofu Data Pipelines, an open-source data integration platform. This command is likely used to import data from various sources into a Tofu pipeline for further processing and transformation. The exact syntax and arguments may vary depending on the version and configuration of Tofu, so it''s recommended to consult the official documentation for more information.'
    flag:
        config: '[AI] The `tofu import --config` command is used in Tofu, a data versioning tool, to import configuration files. These files define the schema and metadata for datasets or artifacts that will be managed with Tofu. By using the `--config` option, users can specify the path to one or more YAML or JSON files containing the configuration data, which will then be imported into Tofu''s registry. This allows users to define and manage their data assets in a structured and versioned manner within the Tofu environment.'
        ignore-remote-version: '[AI] The `tofu import --ignore-remote-version` flag is used with the Tofu dependency management tool in Rust programming language. This flag instructs Tofu to import dependencies without checking for updates or enforcing remote version constraints in the `Cargo.toml` file during the build process. In other words, it skips the version resolution step and uses the previously installed versions instead. This can be useful when testing local modifications on specific dependency versions or dealing with network issues.'
        input: '[AI] The command `tofu import --input` is a flag used in Tofu, a data versioning tool for machine learning models and datasets. This flag instructs Tofu to import data or models from a specified input source, such as a file, URL, or another Tofu artifact ID. When using this command, users need to provide the path to the input file or URL as an argument. The imported data or model will be versioned and stored in the Tofu registry for future use.'
        lock: '[AI] The `tofu import --lock` command is used in version control systems like Git, specifically with Composer for managing PHP dependencies. This command downloads and installs specified PHP packages from the official Packagist repository, and then locks the package versions to prevent future updates or conflicts. By using this command, you can ensure consistent and stable dependencies across your projects while developing locally.'
        lock-timeout: '[AI] The `tofu import --lock-timeout` flag is used in the Tofu data pipeline tool for managing data versioning and workflows. Specifically, it sets the maximum duration for acquiring a lock on a dataset before an import operation times out. If the lock cannot be acquired within the specified time, the import will fail. This helps prevent long-running or stuck imports from blocking other processes.'
        no-color: '[AI] The `tofu import --no-color` command is used in R packages to import data or files without displaying colored output in the console. The `--no-color` option suppresses any color formatting of the imported data, ensuring that the output is monochrome and can be easily read in text-based environments where color support may not be available.'
        var: '[AI] The `tofu import -var` command is used in the Tofu, a Kubernetes open-source security scanning tool for Helm charts and container images. This specific command imports variables from an external YAML file or environment variables into the Tofu configuration. It allows extending or overriding existing variables during the scan process. The imported variables can be later used to customize the behavior of Tofu, such as setting different scan policies for various environments or applications.'
        var-file: '[AI] The `tofu import --var-file` flag is used with Tofu, a GitOps tool for Kubernetes, to import configuration values from an external file in YAML format. This flag allows users to apply multiple key-value pairs as variables during the import process, making it easier to manage and update cluster configurations. By supplying a file path or using `stdin` with `--`, users can provide variable definitions which Tofu will apply to the imported resources in a declarative manner.'
