documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flutter build linux` is a command used in the Flutter framework for creating a native Linux executable from a Flutter project. It builds and packages the application for the Linux platform, generating artifacts like `linux-x64` or `arm64` depending on your system architecture. The output includes an executable file and necessary libraries to run the app on Linux distributions.'
    flag:
        analyze-size: '[AI] `flutter build linux --analyze-size` is a command used in Flutter development to generate a Linux executable of your app and analyze its size. The `--analyze-size` option enables size analysis, which provides detailed information about the size of each component in your app''s binary, including code, resources, and third-party libraries. This information can help you identify potential areas for size optimization in your Flutter project.'
        dart-define: '[AI] `flutter build linux` is a command used in the Flutter framework to create a native Linux application from the Dart codebase. The `--dart-define` option that follows is used to define constant flags during the build process. These constants can be referenced in the Dart code using the `dart:developer` library''s `const` keyword. By defining constants with `--dart-define`, you can pass configuration-specific values to your application without modifying the source code directly. For instance, you might use it to set an environment variable or configure a third-party package.'
        debug: '[AI] `flutter build linux --debug` is a command used in Flutter, a mobile app development framework, to create a Linux distribution of an application and generate debug symbols. This process builds the application for the Linux desktop platform and generates additional debugging information in the form of symbol files. These symbols allow advanced features like source-level debugging when the app crashes or encounters issues.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `flutter build linux` is a command used in Flutter, a mobile application development framework, to create a native Linux executable from a Flutter project. The `--help` option is used to display detailed information about how to use this specific command. When you run `flutter build linux --help`, it will output instructions on the correct usage of the command. Here's a brief overview:

            - `flutter build linux`: Builds a Linux executable from your Flutter project.
            - `--help`: Displays detailed help information for this command, including available options and their usage. This option helps users understand how to correctly use the command for building their projects.
        no-analyze-size: '[AI] `flutter build linux` is a command used in Flutter development to create a native Linux executable from Dart code. The `--no-analyze-size` option disables the size analysis during the build process. Size analysis gathers statistics about the size of the application and its components but it can add extra time to the build process. By skipping this step with `--no-analyze-size`, the build process will run faster.'
        no-null-assertions: '[AI] `flutter build linux` is a command used in the Flutter framework to create a native Linux executable from a Dart project. The `--no-null-assertions` flag is an option that disables null safety checks during the build process. This means that the generated code may contain potential NullPointerExceptions, and it''s the developer''s responsibility to ensure proper handling of potential null values when using the output. By default, Flutter enables null safety checks which helps prevent such exceptions at compile time.'
        no-obfuscate: '[AI] `flutter build linux` is a command used in Flutter development to create a Linux distributable package from the Flutter project. The `--no-obfuscate` flag is an optional argument that disables code obfuscation during the build process. Obfuscation is a technique used for protecting the intellectual property of software by making its code more difficult to read and understand, thus making reverse engineering harder. By not using this flag, the resulting Linux application will have readable source code which can be beneficial for debugging purposes but may expose the underlying implementation details, potentially impacting security or privacy.'
        no-pub: |-
            [AI] `flutter build linux` is a command used in Flutter, a mobile app development framework by Google. This command builds an application for a Linux desktop environment. The `--no-pub` flag disables the pub get process during the build.

            By default, when using `flutter build`, Flutter downloads and installs any required packages from the `pubspec.yaml` file before building the project. However, with `--no-pub`, these packages must already be installed locally or available on the system PATH for the build to succeed. This flag can save time during the build process if the packages have been installed previously.
        no-track-widget-creation: '[AI] `flutter build linux` is a command used in Flutter development to create a native Linux application from Dart code. The `--no-track-widget-creation` flag is an optional argument that disables the tracking of widget creation during the build process. This can reduce the size of the generated binary, as it prevents Flutter from including additional libraries related to widget creation and destruction tracking. It may be useful for distributing smaller applications or for environments with limited resources.'
        no-tree-shake-icons: '[AI] The `flutter build linux` command is used to build a Flutter application for Linux desktop deployment. The `--no-tree-shake-icons` option disables tree shaking for icon files during the build process. Tree shaking is an optimization technique that eliminates unused code in a Flutter project, but it can sometimes remove the references to icon files, leading to missing or broken icons in the Linux application. By using `--no-tree-shake-icons`, you ensure that all icon files are included in the final build, even if they may not be used in every part of the application.'
        null-assertions: |-
            [AI] `flutter build linux --no-root-check --no-analytics --release` is a command used in Flutter development for creating a native Linux executable from the Dart code. The `--release` flag optimizes the output for production use.

            The `--no-root-check` and `--no-analytics` flags are optional, disabling checks for running as root and collecting usage statistics respectively, for security or privacy reasons.

            The additional flag `--null-assertions` is an opt-in null safety feature in Dart that enables the compiler to assume that all references have non-nullable types, allowing the code to compile even if there are potential null reference errors. When building for production, it's recommended to disable null assertions to catch such errors during runtime. However, if you have verified your code thoroughly and want to enable this feature for performance reasons, use the `--null-assertions` flag when building.
        obfuscate: '[AI] `flutter build linux --obfuscate` is a command used in Flutter, a mobile app development framework, to build a Linux executable of an application and obfuscate its code for enhanced security. Obfuscation makes the code harder to read by minifying and renaming elements, making reverse engineering more difficult. This command combines building the application for Linux with the additional step of code obfuscation.'
        profile: '[AI] `flutter build linux --profile` is a command used in Flutter development for creating a deployable Linux application from the project sources. The `--linux` option specifies that a Linux binary should be generated, while `--profile` instructs Flutter to include only the selected components in the built package, which can help reduce the final size of the application and improve its performance. By default, Flutter includes all possible features when building for desktop platforms. Using this command allows developers to fine-tune their builds to include just what''s necessary for their specific use case.'
        pub: |-
            [AI] `flutter build linux --pub` is a command used in Flutter development to create a deployable package for a Linux application. This command performs several tasks:

            1. It compiles the Dart code into machine code using Flutter's built-in toolchain.
            2. It builds native code for Linux platforms using the Yocto Project or Fuchsia emulator, if available.
            3. It packages the generated binaries and assets with any required dependencies listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file.
            4. It creates a `.deb` (for Debian-based distributions) or `.rpm` (for RPM-based distributions) package for easy installation.
            5. The output of this command is a distributable Linux application package, ready for deployment and installation on target systems.
        release: '[AI] `flutter build linux --release` is a command used in Flutter development for generating a release-ready executable for a Linux operating system. It performs several optimizations and minifies the code to reduce the binary size. The output is a standalone application bundle that can be installed on Linux systems without requiring a Flutter or Dart runtime.'
        split-debug-info: '[AI] `flutter build linux` is a command used in Flutter development to create a native Linux executable from Dart code. The `--split-debug-info` option is used to generate separate debug info files for each shared library in the output binary. This can help reduce the size of the final executable and make it easier to attach a debugger during runtime.'
        target: |-
            [AI] `flutter build linux --target` is a command used in Flutter development to create a deployable Linux application from the project's codebase. This command invokes the Flutter tool to perform several tasks:

            1. Compiles the Dart code into native machine code using the included Dart-to-native (Dart2Native) and C++ compilers.
            2. Links the generated machine code with the necessary libraries and resources.
            3. Creates a Linux package structure, including a `debian.manifest` file for packaging and distribution through standard Linux package managers.
            4. Builds the application's icon and other assets if they have been provided.
            5. Generates a `.AppImage` file that can be run directly on Linux systems without requiring installation or dependency management.

            This command makes it easier to create standalone Linux applications from Flutter projects, simplifying the process of delivering software to users who prefer or require Linux platforms.
        target-platform: '[AI] `flutter build linux --target-platform` is a command used in Flutter, a UI toolkit developed by Google. This command generates a native Linux executable from a Flutter project''s Dart code and assets. The resulting binary can be run on Linux distributions without requiring the Flutter or Dart SDK to be installed. It packages all necessary dependencies within the produced executable file.'
        target-sysroot: '[AI] `flutter build linux --target-sysroot` is a command used in Flutter development for building native Linux applications from Dart code. The `--target-sysroot` option specifies the location of the cross-compilation toolchain''s root filesystem, which contains the necessary system headers and libraries for building the Linux application. The output will be generated in the `out/linux-x64/release` directory, ready for deployment on a Linux distribution.'
        track-widget-creation: '[AI] `flutter build linux` is a command used in Flutter development to create a native Linux executable from Dart code. The `--track-widget-creation` option is an argument that enables tracking of widget creation for performance analysis during the build process. This can help identify and address performance issues related to widget recreation, which can improve overall application efficiency on Linux platforms.'
        tree-shake-icons: '[AI] `flutter build linux` is a command used in Flutter, a mobile app development framework by Google, to create a native Linux executable from a Dart codebase. The `--tree-shake-icons` option is a flag that enables icon optimization during the build process. This means that only the necessary icons from the project''s `material.dart` and other icon libraries are included in the final Linux binary, reducing its size and improving its performance.'
