documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git notes edit` is a Git command used to edit the annotated tag message or commit message associated with a note in Git. A note is a type of annotation that can be attached to any ref, representing metadata that''s not part of the commit history itself. The command opens the editor with the current message and saves the changes upon exit.'
    flag:
        allow-empty: '[AI] The `git notes edit --allow-empty` command is used to edit a note attached to a Git commit with an allowance for an empty note message. This means that you can save the note without entering any text if desired, whereas by default, Git requires a non-empty note message when creating or editing one. This option is useful when you want to modify an existing note without having to change its content.'
