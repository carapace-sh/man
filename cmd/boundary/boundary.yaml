documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `boundary` command is not a standard Unix or Linux command. It might refer to specific utilities used in certain applications, such as image processing or network security tools, where it sets boundaries for processing data. For instance, in the context of email filtering with Procmail, the `boundary` keyword defines where to split messages at headers and attachments based on their delimiters. Always refer to the specific tool documentation for precise information.'
