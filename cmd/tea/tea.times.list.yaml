documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea times list` command is not a standard Linux or Unix command, and it seems to be specific to a certain application or configuration. In general terms, if we assume that this command is related to managing tea scheduling or appointments, then it might display a list of all scheduled tea times or appointments. The exact output format may vary depending on the specific implementation.'
    flag:
        fields: '[AI] The `tea times list --fields` command is used in Teaspoon, a CLI tool for managing Teaspec tests in Rails applications. This command lists all the available test cases with their corresponding test fields. Test fields are metadata describing the characteristics of each test case, such as its focus or priority level. By displaying this information, developers can easily identify and filter tests based on specific criteria, aiding in test maintenance and organization.'
        from: '[AI] The `--from` option in the `teatimes list` command of the TeaDB tool is used to specify a starting point for listing tea sets. This option takes a timestamp or a tag as its argument, and only tea sets that were added or modified after this point will be included in the output. For example, `teas times list --from "2021-01-01"` would show all tea sets added or updated on or after January 1, 2021.'
        login: '[AI] The `tea times list --login` command is related to the TeaTime scheduling tool, which helps manage recurring events or tasks. This specific command is used for logging into the TeaTime server with the intention of accessing and managing scheduled events. It requires authentication with valid credentials to execute properly.'
        mine: '[AI] The command `tea times list --mine` is used in the TeaDB (Teas Database) CLI (Command Line Interface) to list tea infusions that have been saved by the current user only. The `--mine` flag filters the results to display only the user''s personal tea infusions, while `tea times list` displays all available infusions in the database.'
        output: '[AI] The `tea times list --output` flag is used with the `tea-times` command in some text-based scheduling tools, such as Tea-Time or Calendr. It instructs the tool to display a list of scheduled "tea times" or appointments, formatted for output to a file or stream. The exact format may vary between different tools, but it typically includes details like date, time, description, and participants.'
        remote: '[AI] The `tea times list --remote` command is used in the TeaVM (The Virtual Machine for Android) project to retrieve a list of remote TeaVM images available in repositories, such as Docker Hub or Google Container Registry. This command interacts with these registries over the network and returns information about each image, including its name, tag, and size. It helps developers to easily check for updates or new versions of TeaVM images and manage their usage accordingly.'
        repo: '[AI] The `tea times list --repo` command is used with Tea Times, a Git repository management tool. This specific command lists all the repositories managed by Tea Times. It provides information such as the repository name, URL, and last updated time. This command helps users to easily view and manage their collection of repositories within Tea Times.'
        total: '[AI] The `tea times list --total` command is used in the TeaDB database management tool. It lists all scheduled tea (backup) times, displaying the total number of teas (backups) for each time. The output provides a clear overview of the backup schedule and the associated storage usage.'
        until: '[AI] The `--until` option used with Git''s `teamatimes` sub-command lists team members who last committed before a specified date. For example, `git tea-times --until 2021-10-31` will display the commit activity of team members prior to October 31, 2021.'
