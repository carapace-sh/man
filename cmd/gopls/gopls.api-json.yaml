documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `gopls api-json` command is used with GoPls, a language server for the Go programming language. It starts GoPls in the JSON RPC API mode and prints its JSON RPC API address on the standard output. This can be useful when integrating GoPls with external tools or editors. The JSON RPC API allows for communication between clients (such as text editors) and servers, enabling features like autocomplete, error checking, and code navigation.'
