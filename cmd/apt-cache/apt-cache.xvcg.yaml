    command: |-
        [AI] The `apt-cache` command with the option `xvcg` is used in Debian-based Linux distributions to search for packages that match a given regular expression pattern in their names, descriptions, or other metadata.

        For example, `apt-cache search ^apache$` will list all packages whose names contain the string "apache". The `x` option makes the search case-insensitive, and the `v` option includes virtual packages. There's no such specific option as `xcg`, but `vcg` stands for "view, virtual and available" packages. So, `apt-cache vcg <regex>` is equivalent to `apt-cache search --types=virtual,vmnet,recommends <regex>`.
