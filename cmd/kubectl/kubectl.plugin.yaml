        [AI] The `kubectl` command is not a plugin itself, but rather a tool for managing and configuring Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes offers an extensible architecture through custom resource definitions (CRDs) and APIs that can be extended with custom plugins or extensions called "controllers."

        These controllers are typically implemented as separate projects and can be installed in your cluster using various methods, including Helm charts, custom Docker images, or manually deploying the controller code. Once installed, they extend the functionality of `kubectl` by defining new resources and verbs that can be interacted with using standard `kubectl` commands.

        In summary, there isn't a direct "kubectl plugin" command, but Kubernetes allows for extending its functionality through custom controllers and plugins, which can be interacted with using regular `kubectl` commands.
