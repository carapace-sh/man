description: copies old-path to new-path
flags:

documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pass cp` command is not a standard Unix or Linux command. It seems to be specific to the Password Store, a password manager created by Julian S. Friedman. This command is used within Password Store to copy an entry from one location to another. When executed, it prompts for source and destination locations, and then copies the specified encrypted entry data to the new location while keeping it encrypted.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The command `cp --force` is a Unix or Linux file copying command with the `--force` option. This option instructs the cp command to overwrite existing files without asking for confirmation, effectively forcing the copy operation to replace any identical destination file. In other words, it ensures that the destination file is always updated with the latest source content, regardless of whether the destination file already exists or not.'
