documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux last-pane` command is used within the TMUX terminal multiplexer environment to switch to the last active pane. In other words, it allows you to quickly navigate back to the most recently used pane in your current TMUX session.'
    flag:
        Z: '[AI] `tmux last-pane -Z` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. It resizes the last pane in the vertical direction to occupy the entire height of the terminal window, making it the size of the terminal. This can be useful when you want to focus on one pane and maximize its size for better viewing or working experience.'
        d: '[AI] `tmux last-pane -d` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. It detaches the last attached pane in the current TMUX session and sends it to the background. This allows you to keep running processes even after you disconnect from the session by logging out or closing the terminal window.'
        e: '[AI] `tmux last-pane -e` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. It brings back the last session and displays the last pane that was active within that session. The `-e` flag allows executing a shell command in that pane. In essence, it restores a previous tmux session and runs a command in its last pane.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux last-pane -t` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. It refers to the most recently accessed pane in the current tmux session. The `-t` option is used to specify the target window or pane, and the `last-pane` argument signifies that the most recently used pane is the intended target. This command can be useful for quickly navigating between multiple panes within a single tmux session.'
