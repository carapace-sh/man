    command: |-
        [AI] The `terramate experimental trigger` command is specific to Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool by Hashicorp. This command is used to manually initiate a run of Terraform's experimental features.

        Experimental features are not officially supported and might change or be removed in future releases. They should generally only be used for testing purposes or when there is no other way to achieve a desired functionality.

        To use this command, ensure that you have initialized your Terraform working directory with `terraform init`. Then run the command: `terraform experimental trigger <experimental_feature>`. Replace `<experimental_feature>` with the name of the experimental feature you want to enable.

        After executing this command, Terraform will apply the changes defined in your configuration files while using the specified experimental feature. Note that if any errors occur during the execution, the application of those changes will be rolled back.
    flag:
        cloud-status: '[AI] The `terramate experimental trigger --cloud-status` flag is a command used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. This specific flag triggers an experimental feature called "Terraform Cloud" within Terraform. It allows users to check the current cloud provider status for their resources and configurations, facilitating better management and monitoring of infrastructure in the cloud.'
        experimental-status: |-
            [AI] The `terramate experimental trigger --experimental-status` flag is a command-line argument used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. This flag is set to enable or control the execution of experimental features in Terraform.

            When the flag is set to `--experimental`, it instructs Terraform to allow the use of experimental features, which may be subject to change or have known limitations. The `--experimental-status` argument provides feedback on which experimental features are currently enabled and being used within the current Terraform configuration.

            By using this flag, users can choose to opt into using new and potentially risky experimental functionality while still maintaining awareness of any associated risks. It's important to note that using experimental features may result in unintended side effects or even data loss, so it should only be done with careful consideration and a good understanding of the potential consequences.
        reason: '[AI] The `terramate experimental trigger --reason` command relates to Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. This specific command is used to deliberately trigger a failure or error within an experimentally modified version of Terraform. The `--experimental` flag enables the usage of experimental features, while `trigger` instructs Terraform to intentionally cause an issue, and `--reason` allows specifying a reason for doing so. This command can be useful for testing and debugging new features or changes in Terraform before they are officially released.'
