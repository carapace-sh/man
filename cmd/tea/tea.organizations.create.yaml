    command: |-
        [AI] The `tea organizations create` command is used in the Teasql database management system for managing tea-related data. This command creates a new organization record in the tea database.

        Syntax: `TEA ORGANIZATIONS CREATE "OrganizationName" ADDRESS "AddressLine1" ADDRESS "AddressLine2" CITY "CityName" STATE "StateAbbr" ZIPCODE "Zipcode"`

        Here, `"OrganizationName"` is the name of the new organization to be created. The `ADDRESS` keyword followed by two lines and `CITY`, `STATE`, and `ZIPCODE` are used to specify the physical location of the organization.
    flag:
        description: '[AI] The "Tea Organization Flag" is a symbol used to represent various tea industries, associations, or organizations. It typically features elements significant to the tea industry such as teapots, infusers, cups, leaves, and sometimes a map of tea-producing regions. Its design may vary among different organizations.'
        location: |-
            [AI] The `--location` option is not a part of the `tea organizations create` command itself, but rather an argument that can be used with this command in some specific contexts, particularly when using certain APIs or CLI tools related to tea organizations, such as those provided by TeaDB or similar platforms.

            When using this option, you are specifying a particular location or address for the new tea organization that is being created. This could be a physical address for a retail store or a virtual address for an online marketplace or community platform. The exact format and requirements of this argument may vary depending on the specific API or CLI tool being used, so it's important to consult the documentation provided by the service for more information.

            In summary, `--location` is an optional argument that can be used with the `tea organizations create` command to specify a particular location or address for the new organization being created.
        login: '[AI] The command `--login` is not a flag for creating a tea organization. It is actually an option for the `ssh` (Secure Shell) command, used when connecting to a remote server. This option instructs the SSH client to start an interactive session as a specific user account with a login shell. Tea organizations do not create this flag or use it in their context.'
        name: '[AI] The `--name` option in the context of creating a Tea Organization flag is used to specify the name of the organization when using Tea-based Continuous Delivery (TCD) or similar tools like Jenkins, Spinnaker, etc. These tools often use flags or commands for creating new organizations or projects with specific configurations. By providing a name with the `--name` option, users ensure that each organization is uniquely identified and can be managed separately. This helps maintain clear separation between different teams or projects within the same continuous delivery platform.'
        repo-admins-can-change-team-access: '[AI] The `--repo-admins-can-change-team-access` flag is a GitHub repository setting used in Git operations. It grants repo administrators the ability to modify team access levels (read, write, or admin) for members on that specific repository. This allows for more flexible and efficient team management within an organization.'
        visibility: |-
            [AI] The term "--visibility" in the context of tea organizations creating a flag is not a widely recognized concept without additional context. However, I can explain what "visibility" generally means in marketing and branding contexts:

            Visibility refers to the degree or extent to which a brand, product, or organization is seen, noticed, or acknowledged by its target audience. In the case of tea organizations, creating visibility involves increasing awareness and recognition of their brand, products, or mission among consumers, media outlets, industry influencers, and other stakeholders.

            This can be achieved through various marketing strategies such as social media campaigns, advertising, public relations, events, partnerships, and content marketing. The goal is to make the organization's presence known and memorable in the minds of potential customers and influencers, ultimately driving growth and engagement.
        website: |-
            [AI] The command `--tea-organizations create --website` is likely a part of a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool used in managing tea organizations and their websites within a specific system or application. Here's what each part of the command does:

            1. `--tea-organizations`: This is a flag to indicate that the following command pertains to managing tea organizations.
            2. `create`: This action creates a new tea organization record in the system.
            3. `--website`: This flag indicates that the new tea organization record will have a website associated with it. The value of this flag would be the URL of the website when used with the create command.
