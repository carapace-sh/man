        [AI] `git commit-graph` is a Git feature that generates a compact, directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of the commits in the current repository. The output can be used by other Git tools or scripts for various purposes such as building dependency graphs, analyzing commit relationships, or performing batch operations on commits based on their dependencies.

        The command does not create a new graph object, but rather writes the output to standard output in a format that can be easily parsed by external tools. The output includes SHA-1 commit hashes and their parent commit hashes, making it possible to traverse the commit history as a graph.
