documentation:
    command: '[AI] `terraform state` is a command provided by Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. This command allows users to display the current state of their managed infrastructure, as stored in the Terraform state file. It provides information about the IDs, attributes, and relationships between resources. Using `terraform state` helps ensure that infrastructure changes are applied consistently across multiple runs of Terraform, and can also be used for destructive operations like planing or applying the deletion of resources.'
