description: Builds and analyzes a docker image from a Dockerfile (this is a thin wrapper for the `docker build` command).
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dive build` is a command used in Dive, a tool for building and managing multi-stage Docker images. This command triggers the construction of Docker images using the Divefile (Dive''s configuration file) located in the current directory. It downloads and builds base images as specified in the Divefile, applies any custom build steps or instructions, and creates a new image that includes only the necessary files from the build context. The resulting image can then be used for running containers with optimized size and security benefits.'
