    command: '[AI] The `gh issue unpin` command is used in the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) to unpin an issue from a repository. An issue pin is a feature that allows users to mark an issue as important or relevant to them, making it easily accessible on their GitHub dashboard. Unpinning an issue removes it from this prominent display but does not affect the status or content of the issue itself.'
