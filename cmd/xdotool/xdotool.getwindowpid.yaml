documentation:
    command: '[AI] `xdotool getwindowpid` is a command-line tool for interacting with X11 windows. The `getwindowpid` sub-command returns the process ID (PID) of the application that owns a given window. You need to provide the window identifier (ID or handle) as an argument, which can be obtained by querying the window manager or using other xdotool commands like `search` or `focusget`. For example, `xdotool getwindowpid <window_id>` will output the PID associated with that window.'
