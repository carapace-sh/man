name: xzcat
description: Compress or decompress .xz and .lzma files
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `xzcat` is a command-line utility in the xz compression toolset, which combines the functionalities of both `xz` (for compressing or decompressing files using the LZMA2 or LZMA3 compression algorithm) and `cat` (for displaying file content). When used with multiple arguments, `xzcat` reads the compressed data from standard input, decompresses it on-the-fly, and pipes it directly to `stdout`, effectively acting as a filter for compressing or decompressing files without writing intermediary files.'
