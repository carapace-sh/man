name: multi-pack-index
description: Write and verify multi-pack-indexes
group: low-level manipulator
flags:
    --batch-size=: during repack, collect pack-files of smaller size into a batch that is larger than this size
    --object-dir=: object directory containing set of packfile and pack-index pairs
    --progress: force progress reporting
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git multi-pack-index` is an internal Git command used to create a multi-pack file, which is a single file that contains multiple individual pack files. This command is typically used when creating Git archives for distribution or backup purposes, allowing the receiver to directly import multiple commits or trees with a single operation. It processes the current index and writes the resulting pack files into the output multi-pack file.'
    flag:
        batch-size: '[AI] `git multi-pack-index` is a Git command used to create a multi-pack file, which is an archive format for Git objects that can be transferred more efficiently than individual git pack files. The `--batch-size` option specifies the maximum number of objects to be written to each chunk in the multi-pack file. This can help reduce network overhead during transfers by allowing larger batches of objects to be sent at once. The default batch size is 100, but it can be adjusted using this option for optimal transfer performance based on network conditions.'
        object-dir: |-
            [AI] The `git multi-pack-index` command with the `--object-dir` option is used to create a Git multi-pack file. A Git multi-pack file is an archive that contains multiple packed refs or commits in a single file.

            The `--object-dir` argument specifies the directory where Git should write the individual pack files, which will be later combined into the final multi-pack file. This command is typically used when you want to create a Git repository bundle for transferring it over a network or for archival purposes. The resulting multi-pack file can be imported back into a Git repository using the `git rcanimport` command.
        progress: '[AI] `git multi-pack-index --progress` is a Git command used to create a multi-pack file from one or more existing pack files. A multi-pack file is a single large archive containing multiple individual pack files, making it more efficient for transferring large repositories over the network. The `--progress` option displays the progress of the operation, showing the percentage completed and the total number of objects being added to the new multi-pack file.'
