    command: |-
        [AI] The `jj git remote add` command is used to add a new remote repository in Git. Here's a breakdown of each part:

        1. `jj` : It is typically not part of this command. `jj` might be an alias for `git`, especially when using a Git GUI or IDE. If it's not the case, you should use `git` instead.
        2. `git` : This is the command-line Git tool.
        3. `remote add` : This subcommand adds a new remote repository to your local Git configuration with a specified name and URL. You provide the shortname (e.g., `origin`) and the URL (`<url>`) as arguments, like so: `git remote add <shortname> <url>`. When you clone a repository, this command is usually run automatically to set up a default remote named `origin` using the cloned URL.
