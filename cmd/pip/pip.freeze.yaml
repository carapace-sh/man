description: Output installed packages in requirements format
flags:
    --all: Do not skip pip, distribute, setuptools, wheel
    --exclude-editable: Exclude editable package from output.
    --exclude=: Exclude specified package from the output
    --path*=: Restrict to the specified installation path for listing packages
    --user: Only output packages installed in user-site.
    -f, --find-links=: URL for finding packages, which will be added to the output.
    -l, --local: If in a virtualenv that has global access, do not output globally-installed packages.
    -r, --requirement*=: Use the order in the given requirements file and its comments when generating output.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pip freeze` is a command used in Python programming language for generating a text file named `requirements.txt`, listing all installed packages and their exact versions in the current virtual environment or project, based on the `Pipfile` or `requirements.txt` files. It helps to maintain consistency among different development environments by allowing easy re-creation of the same set of dependencies.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `pip freeze --all` is a command used in Python programming language to generate and save a text file containing a list of all installed packages, along with their specific versions, in a project''s virtual environment using pip (Python Package Installer). This command can be helpful for sharing or recreating the exact package environment of a Python project.'
        exclude: '[AI] `pip freeze --exclude` is a command used in Python programming for managing virtual environments and dependencies with pip, the Packaging Installer for Python. The `--exclude` option allows you to exclude specific packages from being included in the generated `requirements.txt` file when using the `pip freeze` command. It helps in excluding unnecessary or unwanted packages that may not be required for your project''s development or deployment.'
        exclude-editable: |-
            [AI] The `pip freeze --exclude-editable` command is a functionality in Python's PIP package manager. It generates a text file containing a list of installed packages, their versions, and other dependencies that are needed to recreate the current environment. However, it does not include "editable" packages in this list.

            An editable package is a local project that is being developed with `pip install -e .` command. These projects are typically in development stage, and their files are not packaged into distribution archives. When you use the `--exclude-editable` option with `pip freeze`, it excludes these editable packages from the frozen requirements file. This can be useful when sharing or synchronizing project dependencies between environments.
        find-links: '[AI] `pip freeze --find-links` is a command used with pip, the Python package installer. This specific command produces a requirement file listing all the packages and their exact versions that are currently installed in a virtual environment, along with any custom sources or index URLs (referred to as find-links) from which pip has fetched these packages. The output of `pip freeze --find-links` is similar to `pip freeze`, but includes the find-link information as well. This command is useful for tracking dependencies, creating consistent environments across machines, and sharing requirements with others.'
        local: '[AI] `pip freeze --local` is a command used in Python programming language for managing virtual environments. This specific command generates and writes out to a text file (by default named `requirements.txt`) a list of all the installed packages, along with their exact versions, that are located in the current local project directory and not globally within the system. This file can then be used for recreating an identical environment by running this command in another environment or sharing it with collaborators.'
        path: '[AI] `pip freeze --path` is a command used with pip, which is a package manager for Python. This specific command generates a text file named `pip-freeze.txt` in the current directory, listing all installed packages and their corresponding versions. The `--path` option specifies the output file path for this text file. It helps to save and share the exact dependencies required by a Python project with other developers or environments.'
        requirement: '[AI] `pip freeze --requirements` is a command used in Python programming language for managing dependencies with pip, which is a package installer for Python. This specific command generates a text file containing a list of installed packages and their exact versions, as specified in the project''s `requirements.txt` file. The resulting file can be shared or checked into version control systems to ensure consistency across different environments.'
        user: '[AI] `pip freeze --user` is a command used in Python programming language to generate a text file named `requirements.txt` containing a list of installed packages with their exact version numbers, based on the user''s local Python environment using pip. This command utilizes the user-specific site packages directory for reading the package versions instead of the global one, making it ideal for sharing your project dependencies with others or for recreating the same environment elsewhere.'
