documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `wezterm cli adjust-pane-size` command is used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator, to programmatically adjust the size of a specific pane within a multi-pane layout. The command takes arguments specifying the new dimensions (columns and rows) for the target pane. For instance, `adjust-pane-size 1 20` sets the height of pane 1 to 20 rows while keeping its width unchanged. The adjustment is instantaneous and applies only to the specified pane.'
    flag:
        amount: '[AI] The `wezterm cli adjust-pane-size --amount` command is used in Wezterm, a modern terminal emulator, to resize the size of an individual pane within a terminal window by a specified amount. The `--amount` flag indicates the number of rows or columns to be added or subtracted from the current pane size. For instance, `adjust-pane-size --amount=5` will increase the height of the selected pane by 5 rows. Similarly, `adjust-pane-size --amount=-3` will decrease the width of the selected pane by 3 columns.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `wezterm cli adjust-pane-size --help` command is related to WezTerm, a terminal emulator for Unix and Windows with a focus on powerful configuration and beautiful customizability. The `adjust-pane-size` subcommand is used to modify the size of WezTerm panes (splitting the terminal window into multiple parts).

            The `--help` option is a request for information about how to use this command, displaying its usage and available options in detail. In brief, it shows that `adjust-pane-size` accepts arguments specifying which pane(s) to adjust (by index or title) and the desired width, height, or both for those panes. For example:

            ```
            wezterm cli adjust-pane-size --pane 1 --width 50 --height 30
            ```

            This command would resize pane 1 (counting from 0) to be 50 columns wide and 30 rows tall.
        pane-id: '[AI] `wezterm cli adjust-pane-size` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator, to resize the specified pane. The command takes an argument `--pane-id` which identifies the specific pane to be resized among multiple panes within a single terminal window. By passing the correct pane ID along with this command, users can adjust the size of individual panes dynamically.'
