documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pkg reinstall` command is used in Pacman, a package manager for Arch Linux and other distributions, to forcefully reinstall or redownload a specific package and its dependencies. This includes removing any old files related to the package before installing new ones, ensuring that the package''s files are updated to their latest versions. If the package is already installed, this command will have no effect if run with root privileges, but it may still be useful for troubleshooting purposes.'
