documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux join-pane` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to merge horizontally adjacent panes into a single pane. This command allows you to combine multiple panes into one, providing more space for working on larger projects or viewing longer outputs within the same TMUX session.'
    flag:
        b: '[AI] The `tmux join-pane` command is used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to join two or more panes horizontally or vertically into a single pane. The `-b` option stands for "below" and specifies that the joined panes should be placed below each other in the same column, creating a vertical layout. For example, running `tmux split-window -v && tmux select-pane -t 0 && tmux join-pane -b` would split the current pane vertically into two and then join them below each other into a single pane.'
        d: '[AI] The `tmux join-pane -d` command is used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to detach and join two or more panes horizontally or vertically, merging their contents into a single pane. The `-d` flag stands for "detach" and allows the session to be detached from the terminal after the panes are joined. This can be useful for managing multiple tasks in separate panes within a single Tmux session.'
        f: '[AI] `tmux join-pane -f` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer used to join two or more panes horizontally or vertically into a single pane. The `-f` option forces the operation, even if there are detached sessions or other conflicting conditions. This command can be useful when working on large projects that require multiple panes and merging them for better focus and efficiency.'
        h: '[AI] `tmux join-pane -h` is a command in TMUX, the terminal multiplexer, used to horizontally join two or more panes into a single pane. The `-h` option indicates that the operation should be performed horizontally across panes. With this command, you can merge multiple horizontal panes into one larger pane, which may be useful for managing large terminal sessions.'
        l: '[AI] `tmux join-pane -l` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to horizontally join two or more adjacent panes into a single pane with the combined width. The "-l" flag stands for "lowest", which means that the joined pane will be created at the lowest position of the split where the selected panes are located.'
        s: '[AI] `tmux join-pane -s` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer used to join two or more panes horizontally or vertically into a single pane. The `-s` option specifies the name or session ID of the Tmux session where this command will be executed. After joining, you''ll have a larger pane with combined content from the original panes. This can be useful for viewing and managing large outputs or multiple related processes within one window.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux join-pane -t` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to join two or more panes horizontally or vertically into a single pane. The `-t` option specifies the target window or pane ID where you want to execute this command. After joining, all the panes under the same window become a single large pane, sharing the same content and scrolling behavior.'
        v: '[AI] `tmux join-pane -v` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that allows you to vertically merge adjacent panes into a single pane. The "-v" option specifies merging in the vertical direction. This can be useful when working with multiple panes of similar content, such as logs or output from multiple commands, and you want to consolidate them for easier viewing.'
