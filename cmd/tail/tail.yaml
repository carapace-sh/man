    --version: output version information and exit
    -F: same as --follow=name --retry
    -c, --bytes=: output the last NUM bytes
    -f, --follow?: output appended data as the file grows
    -n, --lines=: output the last NUM lines, instead of the last 10
    -q, --quiet=: never output headers giving file names
    -s, --sleep-interval=: with -f, sleep for approximately N seconds
    -v, --verbose: always output headers giving file names
    -z, --zero-terminated: line delimiter is NUL, not newline
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tail` is a Linux command used to display the last n lines of a file, where n can be a number or the keyword ''n'' followed by a number for specifying the number of lines to be displayed. For instance, `tail -5 filename` will show the last 5 lines of the file "filename". Without an argument, it displays the last 10 lines. It''s particularly useful for observing recent log entries or checking the end of large files.'
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `tail -F` is a command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems used to display the last N lines or the real time output of a file, starting at the current size of the file and updating the output as new data is appended. The `-F` option tells `tail` to follow the file and display new data as it appears.'
        bytes: '[AI] The `tail` command in Unix-based systems is used to view the last n lines of a file. When used with the option `--bytes=<num>`, it displays the last <num> bytes of a file instead of last <n> lines. This can be useful when dealing with binary files or specific data located at a fixed position in a large file.'
        follow: '[AI] `tail --follow` is a command in Unix-like operating systems used to follow real-time updates of a file''s contents, starting from the end. When you run this command with the filename as an argument, it displays the last 10 lines by default and continuously updates the output to show new data as it is being written to the file. This is particularly useful for monitoring log files or any other file where new data is frequently added.'
        help: '[AI] The `tail` command with the `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use the `tail` utility in various Unix-like operating systems. It provides a summary of `tail`''s functionality, including its purpose (to display the last N lines of a file), options for specifying the number of lines to output or following real-time files, and other advanced features like reading from standard input.'
        lines: '[AI] The `tail` command with the `--lines` option in Unix-based systems is used to display the last N lines of a file. By default, `N` is set to 10 lines, but it can be changed by specifying a different number after the `--lines` flag. This is particularly useful when dealing with large files and wanting to quickly view recent additions or errors without having to scroll through the entire file.'
        max-unchanged-stats: '[AI] The `tail` command with the option `--max-unchanged-stats` is used to display the last N lines of the output of a command or file, where N is the number of lines that have not changed between successive invocations. This means it only shows new or modified lines since the last run. For instance, in the context of system logging or monitoring tools, this option can be useful to quickly identify recent log entries or changes.'
        pid: '[AI] The `tail` command with the option `--pid=PID` in Unix or Linux systems is used to follow real-time the output of a specific process identified by its Process ID (PID). This allows observing the last lines or the entire output as it''s being written, useful for monitoring log files or checking the end of a long-running process.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `tail` command with the `--quiet` option in Unix or Linux is used to display only the lines containing a given pattern in a file. If no pattern is specified, it prints only empty lines, indicating the absence of the given data in the file. In summary, `tail --quiet [file]` suppresses non-matching output and shows only the matching lines.'
        retry: '[AI] The `tail` command with the `--retry` option is used to follow the append-only file and automatically resume output if the process is interrupted. If an error occurs while reading the file, such as a SIGPIPE or EINTR signal, `tail --retry` will attempt to restart reading from the same offset until it succeeds. This flag is particularly useful when monitoring large files that are being written in real-time, ensuring continuous output without losing data due to interruptions.'
        sleep-interval: '[AI] The `tail` command with the `--sleep-interval` option is used to monitor the last N lines of a file in real time, where N is specified by the user. Unlike the regular `tail` command that only shows new lines appended to the file, this version periodically refreshes the output with a sleep interval specified by the user, providing real-time updates on the file''s contents. This can be useful when monitoring logs or other files that are frequently updated in real time.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `tail` command with the `--verbose` option is used to display not only the last n lines of a file but also information such as the file''s size, timestamp of last modification, and the offset from the beginning of the file where the output starts. For example, `tail -n 10 --verbose filename.txt` will display the last 10 lines along with relevant metadata.'
        version: '[AI] The `tail` command in Unix-based systems is used to display the last n lines of a file. The option `--version` is used to display the version information of the tail command itself, including its name, version number, and compilation information. This can be helpful for identifying which version of the command is being used for troubleshooting or compatibility purposes.'
        zero-terminated: '[AI] The `tail` command with the option `--zero-terminated` is used in Unix or Linux systems to display the last N bytes of a file instead of the last lines. With this option, each output line ends with a null character (0x00) instead of the newline character (0x0A), which is the default behavior for `tail`. This makes it suitable for processing binary data where preserving exact byte sequences is important.'
