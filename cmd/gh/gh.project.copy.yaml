documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh project copy` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new project in GitHub by copying an existing repository. It takes the source repository''s URL or local path as its argument and prompts for a new project name, description, and public or private access level. The command then creates a new GitHub repository with the specified details and sets up a new local git repository linked to the new remote one.'
    flag:
        drafts: '[AI] `gh project copy --drafts` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new project in GitHub using an existing project as a template. The `--drafts` option specifies that the new project should be created as a draft, meaning it will not be published or visible to others until it is explicitly set to public. This command helps in creating consistent projects with predefined repositories, workflows, and collaborations.'
        format: |-
            [AI] The `gh project copy --format` is a command used in GitHub's `gh` CLI tool to create a new project with specified files or directories from an existing one, while customizing the output format of the copied data.

            The basic syntax is:

            ```bash
            gh project copy [SOURCE_PROJECT] [DESTINATION_PROJECT] --template [TEMPLATE_FILE]
            ```

            To modify the output format, you can use the `--format` flag followed by a custom JSON or YAML template:

            ```bash
            gh project copy [SOURCE_PROJECT] [DESTINATION_PROJECT] --template '@PATH/TO/TEMPLATE.json' --format 'output.json'
            ```

            This command will create a new project based on the specified source project and apply the customizations defined in the template file, then save the output of the `--format` flag into a file named `output.json`.
        jq: |-
            [AI] `gh project copy --jq` is a command used with GitHub's `gh` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. The command is designed to copy an entire GitHub project, including the repository and its collaborators, from one account or organization to another.

            The `--jq` option in this command is for processing JSON output with the `jq` language query. It allows filtering, transforming, and extracting specific information from the JSON data returned by the GitHub API during the project copy operation. With this option, you can customize the data that gets saved to local files or used further in pipelines or scripts.
        source-owner: '[AI] The `gh project copy` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for managing projects. The `--source-owner` option specifies the owner of the original repository being copied. This option ensures that the new project will inherit the permissions and collaboration settings from the original repository, allowing the same members to access the new project with their existing roles.'
        target-owner: '[AI] The `gh project copy --target-owner` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to transfer ownership of a GitHub project from one account to another. In simple terms, it allows you to copy the ownership of an existing project and assign it to a new owner specified by the `--target-owner` flag. This command requires authentication using GitHub tokens or SSH keys for authorization. It''s important to note that this action will transfer all collaborators along with the project, making sure there is no disruption in ongoing work.'
        template: '[AI] `gh project copy --template` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new project from an existing one while applying a specific GitHub Template. This command copies the source project''s repository and its entire history, including branches and tags, and applies the specified template during project creation. The result is a new project with the desired structure and files set up based on the selected template.'
        title: '[AI] The `gh project copy` command is a GitHub CLI (github-cli) command used to create a new project in GitHub with the same configuration as an existing one. The `--title` option sets the title or name of the new project. In summary, `gh project copy --title <new_project_title>` creates a new project with the same configuration as an existing one but with a specified new title.'
