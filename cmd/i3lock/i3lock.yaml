documentation:
    command: '[AI] `i3lock` is a command-line tool used in the i3 window manager for Linux systems to lock the screen, requiring a password for unlocking. It presents a customizable lock screen with adjustable settings for appearance, including background image and color scheme. The command can be run from a terminal or scheduled as a system lock screen using a configuration file or script. Upon successful entry of the correct password, the i3 session resumes normally.'
    flag:
        beep: '[AI] `i3lock --beep` is a command used in the i3 window manager for Linux to lock the screen with a beep sound as feedback upon successful execution. The command locks the screen, requiring a password to regain access. The `--beep` option generates an audible alert once the locking process has finished.'
        color: '[AI] `i3lock --color` is a command used in the i3 window manager for Linux to lock the screen and securely protect the session. The `--color` option sets custom colors for various parts of the lock screen, including the background, border, text, and cursor. By default, i3lock uses black and white colors, but with this option, users can define their preferred color scheme for a more personalized look.'
        debug: '[AI] `i3lock --debug` is a command used in i3WM (i3 Window Manager) to lock the screen with debug mode enabled. In debug mode, i3lock provides more detailed output and diagnostic information during the screen locking process. This can be useful for troubleshooting any potential issues or understanding the underlying workings of i3lock. The option `--debug` is passed as an argument when invoking the command.'
        ignore-empty-password: '[AI] `i3lock` is a popular screen locker used in the i3 window manager for Linux and Unix systems. The `--ignore-empty-password` option modifies the locking behavior, allowing users to set an empty password or no password at all. By ignoring an empty password, the screen locker ensures enhanced security by requiring a non-blank input when attempting to unlock the session. This can be useful for shared workstations or public access computers where it is not practical or desirable to remember individual user passwords.'
        image: '[AI] `i3lock` is a popular lock screen utility for the i3 window manager in Linux. The `--image` option specifies the path to an image file that will be used as the background for the lock screen. When you run `i3lock --image /path/to/image.jpg`, the specified image will be displayed on the locked screen, making it a visually appealing and secure way to protect your desktop session.'
        no-unlock-indicator: '[AI] `i3lock` is a popular graphical lock screen utility for the i3 window manager. The command `i3lock --no-unlock-indicator` is used to set the lock screen with no visible unlock indicator. This means that once the lock screen is activated, there will be no visual cue to indicate that the screen can be unlocked by entering the correct password or using another authentication method. This can be useful for security reasons in public or shared environments where it''s important to prevent others from accessing your computer without authorization.'
        nofork: '[AI] i3lock is a popular lock screen utility for the i3 window manager in Linux. The `--nofork` option is used to prevent the creation of a new process when i3lock is run. This can be useful in environments where process creation is limited or restricted, such as embedded systems or virtual machines. By using `--nofork`, i3lock will run in the same process and does not create any child processes.'
        pointer: '[AI] `i3lock` is a graphical lock screen utility for i3wm, a popular window manager for Linux and Unix systems. The `--pointer` option is used to show the mouse pointer during the locking process. This means that when you activate the lock screen with `i3lock --pointer`, the screen will be locked, but the mouse pointer will remain visible, allowing users to move it around without being able to interact with the desktop or applications. The lock screen can only be unlocked by entering the correct password or using another authenticated method configured in i3wm.'
        raw: '[AI] `i3lock --raw` is a command used in the i3 window manager for Linux to lock the screen and display an customizable image or text-based lock screen. The `--raw` option sets i3lock to output raw pixels directly to the framebuffer, bypassing any compositing window manager or X server extension. This can be useful for setting up a secure and simple terminal access point on headless servers or digital signage applications.'
        show-failed-attempts: '[AI] `i3lock --show-failed-attempts` is a command-line option for the i3lock screen locker in the i3wm window manager. This option enables displaying failed login attempt messages on the locked screen, showing the usernames and numbers of unsuccessful login attempts. It can serve as an additional security measure to alert users if someone tries to guess their passwords.'
        tiling: '[AI] i3lock is a powerful and customizable lock screen utility for the i3 window manager. The "--tiling" option is used to enable tiling mode on the lock screen. This means that only one application or content will be displayed full-screen, occupying the entire available space. The rest of the screen real estate is left empty or dark, providing a minimalist and distraction-free lock screen experience. When a user attempts to log back in, the tiled content will be replaced by the login prompt, allowing for secure access to the system.'
        version: '[AI] `i3lock --version` is a command used with the i3wm window manager to display a lock screen and secure the desktop session. When executed with this argument, it prints out the version information of the installed i3lock package, including its major and minor releases, as well as any available build or revision number. It does not perform any locking functionality; it simply provides version information for informational purposes.'
