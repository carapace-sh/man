    command: '[AI] The `npm help` command is used to display help information about npm (Node Package Manager). You can use it with different arguments to get specific help on various topics such as commands, options, or specific packages. For example, `npm help install` would provide you with details on how to use the "install" command in npm. If used without any arguments, it will display a list of available commands and their usage.'
    flag:
        viewer: '[AI] `npm help --viewer` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). This command opens the npm documentation for a specific topic or command in your default web browser. The `--viewer` flag is optional and specifies that you want to use an external viewer (like a web browser) instead of displaying the documentation directly in the terminal using `npm help`.'
