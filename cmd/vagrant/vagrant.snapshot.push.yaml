    command: |-
        [AI] The `vagrant snapshot push` command is used to share a saved Vagrant virtual machine state (snapshot) on a remote server, typically using Vagrant Cloud or another shared storage solution. This allows easy backup and restoration of VMs across multiple environments.

        The command first saves a local snapshot using the `vagrant save` command and then pushes that snapshot to the remote location by authenticating, connecting to the remote server, and uploading the snapshot file. Once uploaded, the snapshot is given a name and description for identification purposes. This allows other users to easily download and restore the VM state from the shared snapshot.
