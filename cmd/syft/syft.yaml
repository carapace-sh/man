documentation:
    command: '[AI] `syft` is a command-line tool used for introspecting Python objects, specifically those in large data structures such as Pandas DataFrames or NumPy arrays. It allows users to explore complex data structures by printing out their memory consumption and various statistical properties like shapes, sizes, and index labels. This can be particularly useful for debugging memory usage issues or gaining a better understanding of the structure of large datasets in Python.'
    flag:
        catalogers: '[AI] The `syft` command is a tool used for synchronizing local and remote directories in Hadoop environments, specifically when dealing with Hive Metastore and HDFS data. The `--catalogers` option is passed to the `syft hiveserver2` sub-command. It is used to specify a comma-separated list of JDBC URLs for connecting to remote Hive Metastores, allowing `syft` to sync metadata between multiple Hive Metastore instances.'
        exclude: '[AI] `syft --exclude` is a command-line option used with Syft, an open-source tool for transferring files between local and remote machines securely. This flag is used to exclude specific files or directories from being synced during the file transfer process. When you use `--exclude`, followed by a pattern (e.g., ''*.log''), Syft will not copy any files matching that pattern between the source and target locations.'
        file: '[AI] The `syft --file` command in Syft, a tool for transferring files between local and remote systems securely, is used to transfer a specific file from a remote system to the local machine. The `--file` option specifies the path to the file on the remote system. For instance, `syft --file /remote/path/to/file .` will transfer the file from `/remote/path/to/file` on the remote system to the current local directory.'
        name: '[AI] `syft --name` is a command used in the Syft tool, which is designed for securely transferring files and directories between local and remote systems. The `--name` option is used to specify the name or names of the files or directories to be synced. When used with this option, Syft will only transfer the specified items, without affecting other files in the source or destination locations.'
        output: '[AI] `syft --output` is a command-line option for Syft, an open-source SSH client for data transfer. This option specifies where to save the output of a Syft operation, such as a file transfer or directory synchronization. The argument following `--output` should be the path and filename for the output file. For example, `syft get user@remote:/path/to/file --output=/local/path/to/save/file`.'
        platform: '[AI] The `syft --platform` command is used with Syft, an open-source tool for securely transferring files between local and remote environments. The `--platform` option specifies which platform (OS and version) the remote environment is running on. This information helps Syft establish a secure connection using the appropriate SSH keys or authentication methods. It also ensures that the transferred files are compatible with the target platform.'
        scope: '[AI] `syft` is a tool used for transferring files and directories between local and remote systems in a secure way. The `--scope` option is used to specify the scope of the transfer. It can be set to `"."` (current directory) or a path, to include only the files and directories under that path during the transfer. This helps to reduce the amount of data transferred and makes the operation more efficient when dealing with large projects or specific subsets of files.'
        template: '[AI] `syft --template` is a command used in Syft, an open-source tool for securely transferring Kubernetes objects between clusters or environments. The `--template` flag is used to generate YAML templates based on existing resources. It reads the definition of a resource from standard input (usually piped from another command like `kubectl get`) and outputs a new YAML file as output. This can be useful for creating reusable templates or modifying configurations before deploying them to different environments.'
