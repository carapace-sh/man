documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tea releases create` is a command used in the Teaspoon testing framework for Ruby projects. This command creates a new release version of your project''s gem, including updating the version number, creating a new Git tag, and building a new gem package. The resulting package can be distributed through a ruby package manager like RubyGems or Bundler.'
    flag:
        asset: '[AI] The `--asset` flag used with the `tea releases create` command in the Tea CLI (Command Line Interface) tool is used to specify that a release should contain an asset or file for distribution. An asset is any file that will be included and distributed as part of the release, such as binary executables, images, documents, etc. This flag helps ensure that specific files are packaged and made available when creating a new release in Tea, which is a toolchain for building, distributing, and managing applications.'
        draft: '[AI] The `--draft` flag used with the `tea releases create` command in the Tea CLI (Command Line Interface) tool signifies creating a new release draft. A release draft is an incomplete or unpublished version of a Git repository tag that can be previewed and edited before being published as a stable release. When this flag is provided, Tea will create a draft release instead of publishing a regular release, allowing you to make modifications if necessary. Once satisfied with the draft, it can later be published using the `tea releases publish` command.'
        login: '[AI] The `--login` flag is used with the `tea releases create` command in the Teapascii CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for Helm. This flag signifies that a new release should be created with Tiller, the Helm server component, authenticated as a specific Kubernetes user or service account. In other words, it configures the creation of a Helm release while assuming the given login credentials to manage Helm repositories and releases in the target Kubernetes cluster.'
        note: '[AI] The `--note` option in the Git command `git push origin <branch-name> --create-ref refs/heads/{branch-name} --notes` or its shorter form `git push origin <branch-name> --create --notes`, which is commonly used with `husbis tea` or other similar library commands for GitOps deployments, is used to include a message or note along with the new branch being created. This can be useful for documenting the reason for creating the branch, such as a specific deployment or release. The note will be stored in the Git repository and can be viewed using the `git show <commit>` command.'
        output: '[AI] `tea releases create --output` is a command in the TeaDB database management system used to create a new release of a database. The `--output` option specifies the output format for the result of the command, which can be in JSON or YAML format. The output will contain metadata about the newly created release, such as its version number and creation timestamp.'
        prerelease: '[AI] `--prerelease` is a flag used with the GitHub Packages `tea create` command for publishing prerelease versions of a package. When this flag is included in the command, a new prerelease version will be created and published instead of creating a regular release. Prereleases are typically used to distribute preliminary or beta versions of a package for testing purposes before making it publicly available as a stable release.'
        remote: |-
            [AI] The `--remote` flag in the Git command `git checkout --create --branch <new-branch-name> <commit> --teach-parent <existing-branch>` can be simplified when using `git push` or `git pull` commands as `git fetch`, `git pull --rebase`, and `git push` with the `--remote` flag.

            The `--remote` flag tells Git to perform the operation on the upstream (origin) repository instead of the local one. When using `tea releases create`, this flag is typically used in the context of creating a new Git branch for a release from the remote origin and tracking it locally. For instance, you might run a command like `git checkout --create --branch my-release-branch origin/my-release-branch`. After setting up your environment, you can push this local branch to the remote repository using `git push origin my-release-branch`, which implicitly includes the `--remote` flag. This will create the new release branch on the remote origin and update your local tracking branch accordingly.
        repo: '[AI] The `--repo` option in the `tea releases create` command is used to specify the Git repository where the new release will be created or updated. This command is part of Tea, a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for managing releases in Git. By using `--repo <repository_url>`, you are instructing Tea to create or update a release in the specified Git repository.'
        tag: '[AI] The `--tag` option in the `tea releases create` command is used to specify a tag name for a new Git release. This command creates and pushes a new release to the Git repository, including a draft or published Git tag with the specified name. It''s a common practice to use descriptive tags for versioning purposes when making and releasing software updates.'
        target: '[AI] The `--target` option in the `tea releases create` command is used to specify the Kubernetes cluster or environment where you want to create or update a release. It takes a YAML file containing the desired release configuration as input. For example, `tea releases create my-release --target my-k8s-cluster.yaml`. This command creates or updates a release using the given configuration in the specified target.'
        title: '[AI] The `--title` option in the GitHub API command `tea releases create` sets the title for a new release. This title is displayed prominently when viewing a repository''s release page, helping users understand the nature and content of the release. It''s a way to provide descriptive and meaningful labels for your releases.'
