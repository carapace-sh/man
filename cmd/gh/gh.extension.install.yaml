description: Install a gh extension from a repository
flags:
    --force: force upgrade extension, or ignore if latest already installed
    --pin=: pin extension to a release tag or commit ref
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `gh extension install` command is used in the GitHub CLI (Git Hub for Command Line) to download and install extensions, which are additional tools that can be integrated into the GitHub workflow, providing extra functionality. This command typically takes the name or identifier of the extension as an argument. For example, `gh extension install ghcli-priorities`. The extension is then added to your GitHub CLI environment, and can be used in subsequent commands or workflows.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The `gh` command with the flag `extension install --force` is used to install a GitHub extension in the VSCode editor, ignoring any existing installation with potential version mismatches or conflicts. This can be useful when updating an extension to its latest version, even if it means overwriting any existing configuration or settings.'
        pin: |-
            [AI] The `gh` command with the flag `--install` and `--pin` is used to install a GitHub Package as a global npm package. With this command, you are telling GitHub's CLI (Command Line Interface) tool `gh` to:

            1. Fetch the latest version of the package from GitHub.
            2. Install the package as a global npm package using the `--install` flag.
            3. Pin the package to its current version, meaning that when you update the package in the future, it will not automatically be updated to the newest version unless you use an explicit update command (e.g., `gh extension update <extension-name>`), thanks to the `--pin` flag.
