name: mousemove
description: Move the mouse to the specific X and Y coordinates on the screen
flags:
    --clearmodifiers: See CLEARMODIFIERS
    --polar: Use polar coordinates
    --screen=: Move the mouse to the specified screen to move to
    --sync: After sending the mouse move request, wait until the mouse is actually moved
    --window=: Specify a window to move relative to
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `xdotool` command with the option `mousemove` is used to programmatically move the mouse pointer to a specific coordinate or relative position on the X window system. The basic syntax is `xdotool mousemove <x> <y>`, where `<x>` and `<y>` represent the horizontal and vertical coordinates, respectively. For instance, `xdotool mousemove 100 200` would move the mouse pointer to the location with the x-coordinate of 100 and y-coordinate of 200.'
    flag:
        clearmodifiers: '[AI] `xdotool mousemove` is a command-line tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical environment in Linux and other Unix-like systems. The option `--clearmodifiers` resets all modifier keys (e.g., Shift, Control, Alt) before executing the `mousemove` action. This helps ensure that the mouse movement is not influenced by any currently pressed modifier keys.'
        polar: '[AI] The `xdotool` command with the option `mousemove --polar` is used to move the mouse pointer in a polar coordinate system way, where you specify the angle and distance from the current mouse position instead of absolute x and y coordinates. This can be useful for automating mouse movements based on angles relative to the current cursor position. The syntax is: `xdotool mousemove <angle> <distance>`. For example, `xdotool mousemove 45 10` moves the mouse pointer 10 units in the direction of a 45-degree angle from its current position.'
        screen: '[AI] `xdotool mousemove` is a command-line tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical environment in Unix-based systems. The `--screen` option specifies which X screen to target with the `mousemove` action. This option takes an argument representing the number or name of the screen, allowing you to move the mouse pointer across different displays connected to your system if needed.'
        sync: '[AI] `xdotool mousemove --sync` is a command used in the xdotool tool, which is a system utility for automating and interacting with X11 applications'' GUIs through the command line. The `mousemove` subcommand moves the mouse pointer to a specified coordinate, while the `--sync` option ensures that the mouse movement is synchronized with the server, ensuring that the action is performed immediately and not asynchronously. This command can be used for automated tests or scripts requiring precise mouse movements.'
        window: '[AI] `xdotool mousemove` is a command-line tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical environment programmatically. The `--window` option specifies which window to target with the mouse movement action. When you use `mousemove --window <window_id>`, it moves the pointer (virtual mouse) to the specified window, allowing automation of GUI interactions for various purposes such as testing or accessibility.'
