    command: '[AI] The `waypoint auth-method set oidc` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool to configure an OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication method for a Waypoint project. This command sets the authentication method for the specified project to use OIDC, allowing users to authenticate using external identity providers such as Okta, Google, or Azure Active Directory.'
    flag:
        access-selector: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint auth-method set oidc --access-selector` flag is used in Waypoint, an open-source continuous delivery platform by Hashicorp. This command sets the authentication method to OpenID Connect (OIDC) and specifies an access selector.

            OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol that allows clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the response from an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user.

            The `--access-selector` option filters the access tokens issued by an OIDC provider based on a given label or value, enabling fine-grained access control in Waypoint deployments.
        allowed-redirect-uri: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint auth-method set oidc --allowed-redirect-uri` command is used in Hashicorp's Waypoint configuration management tool to configure an OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication method. This specific command sets the allowed redirect URI for this authentication method.

            When using external identity providers like Google or Azure AD, the `--allowed-redirect-uri` option specifies the URL that the identity provider should redirect the user back to after they've successfully authenticated. This ensures secure and accurate handling of the access token exchanged during the OIDC flow.
        app: '[AI] The `--flag "waypoint auth-method set oidc" --app` command in Waypoint is used to configure an application with OpenID Connect (OIDC) as the authentication method. Waypoint is an open-source deployment and delivery tool by Hashicorp. With this flag, Waypoint sets up the application to use OIDC for handling user authentication and authorization, allowing integration with external identity providers like Okta or Azure AD, among others.'
        claim-mapping: '[AI] The `waypoint auth-method set oidc --claim-mapping` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool to configure an authentication method of type OpenID Connect (OIDC). The `--claim-mapping` option specifies how specific claims should be mapped from the OIDC provider to the Waypoint environment. This allows Waypoint to authenticate and authorize access based on the claimed information from the OIDC provider, enabling secure management of infrastructure.'
        claim-scope: '[AI] The `--auth-method set oidc` flag in the context of a waypoint command sets the authentication method to OpenID Connect (OIDC). The `--claim-scope` flag specifies which OpenID Connect claims the service should request from the identity provider. These claims contain additional data about the user beyond just an identifier, such as name or email address. Together, these flags allow Waypoint to authenticate users using OIDC and request specific user information.'
        client-id: '[AI] The command `flag "waypoint auth-method" set oidc --client-id` is used to configure Waypoint, an open-source multi-cloud application delivery platform, to use OpenID Connect (OIDC) as the authentication method and specify a particular client ID for this setup. By setting the `auth-method` flag to `oidc`, Waypoint will utilize OIDC for managing access and identity within the system. The `--client-id` argument provides the unique identifier of the OIDC client application registered with an OpenID Connect provider, enabling Waypoint to authenticate with that provider using this configuration.'
        client-secret: '[AI] The flag `--auth-method set oidc` specifies that the authentication method for this operation will be OpenID Connect (OIDC). The `--client-secret` flag is used to provide the client secret associated with the OIDC application, which is required to establish secure communication between the client and the identity provider. Together, these flags configure the operation to use OIDC for authentication with a client secret.'
        description: '[AI] The `--flag "waypoint auth-method set oidc" --description` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool to configure authentication using OpenID Connect (OIDC) as the authentication method. The `set` keyword signifies that an existing value will be replaced with this new configuration. This flag may be used in conjunction with other flags or within a Waypoint module file for automating and managing the application of this specific authentication method.'
        display-name: |-
            [AI] The flag `--auth-method set oidc` for a flag command like `waypoint` sets the authentication method to OpenID Connect (OIDC). The `--oidc` option specifies that this method uses OIDC, and the `set` keyword indicates that it is being explicitly set.

            The `--display-name` flag is used to provide a human-readable name for the configuration, which can be useful for identification purposes within the system or for documentation.
        issuer: '[AI] The `--auth-method set oidc` flag in a Kubernetes context, such as within a `kubectl` command, is used to configure an OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication method for interacting with a specific cluster or namespace. The `--issuer` parameter sets the identifier of the OIDC provider issuing the tokens. This identifier is used by Kubernetes to validate and trust the tokens issued by that provider. In summary, this flag configures Kubernetes to use OIDC for authentication, with the specified issuer being the trusted provider.'
        issuer-ca-pem: '[AI] The `--auth-method set oidc` flag in this command configures the authentication method as OpenID Connect (OIDC). The `--issuer-ca-pem` flag appends a CA (Certificate Authority) PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail) certificate to the OIDC configuration. This certificate is used to verify the identity of the OIDC provider, ensuring secure communication between the client and the provider.'
        list-claim-mapping: |-
            [AI] The command `flag "waypoint auth-method" set oidc --list-claim-mapping` is used in Waypoint, an open-source GitOps platform for Kubernetes. This command sets the authentication method for Waypoint to use OpenID Connect (OIDC), and specifically requests a list of claim mappings.

            Claim mapping refers to how data from an external identity provider (IdP) is mapped to claims in an OIDC token. Waypoint uses this information to determine which Kubernetes resources or access levels should be granted based on the user's identity from the IdP. By running `--list-claim-mapping`, you can view the current claim mappings configured within Waypoint for your OIDC provider.
        plain: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint auth-method set oidc --plain"` is a command used in Waypoint, an open-source GitOps platform for Kubernetes. This specific command sets the authentication method for Waypoint to use OpenID Connect (OIDC) with plain text credentials. In simpler terms, it configures Waypoint to authenticate with an external OIDC provider using the client ID and secret directly provided in the command without using a secure file or environment variable.'
        project: '[AI] The flag `--auth-method set oidc` in the context of Terraform or other infrastructure management tools sets the authentication method for a specific provider to use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for managing access to cloud resources. The `--project` flag likely refers to specifying the ID of a particular project within the OIDC provider, such as an Google Cloud Platform project ID. Together, these flags configure the provider to authenticate using an OIDC provider and link actions to the specified project.'
        signing-algorithm: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint auth-method set oidc --signing-algorithm` command is used in Hashicorp's Waypoint configuration management tool to configure an OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication method for secure communication between Waypoint and a remote server or application.

            The `oidc` argument specifies that the authentication method is OpenID Connect, while `--signing-algorithm` sets the algorithm used for signing the JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) exchanged during the authentication process. The exact algorithm value depends on the specific implementation of OIDC being used and should be specified according to its documentation.
        workspace: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint auth-method set oidc --workspace"` is used in Terraform''s Waypoint CLI to configure authentication for a specific workspace using OpenID Connect (OIDC) as the method. This flag sets the authentication type for the given workspace to OIDC. No further action is required after setting this flag, as it assumes you have already configured the necessary OIDC provider details elsewhere in your Waypoint configuration.'
