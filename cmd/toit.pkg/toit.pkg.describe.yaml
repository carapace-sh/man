documentation:
    command: '[AI] `toit pkg describe` is a Toit programming language command used to retrieve detailed information about a specific package, including its name, version number, description, dependencies, authors, and licenses.

    flag:
        allow-local-deps: '[AI] `toit pkg describe` is a command used in Toit programming language''s package management system. The `--allow-local-deps` option enables the description of a package along with its local dependencies, which are packages that are not published in the public Toit package index but are instead located in the local file system or version control systems like Git. This command generates a description file for the specified package and its local dependencies, including their versions and other metadata.'
        disallow-local-deps: '[AI] The `toit pkg describe` command with the `--disallow-local-deps` option is used to check and generate a description file for a Toit package, while disallowing any local dependencies. In other words, it ensures that all required packages are listed as explicit dependencies in the generated `.tpdesc` file, without relying on any locally installed packages that might not be part of the official package repository. This can help maintain consistent and reproducible builds across different environments.'
        out-dir: '[AI] `toit pkg describe` is a Toit programming language command used to generate metadata about a Toit package in a machine-readable format. The option `--out-dir <directory>` specifies the directory where the generated description file(s) should be saved. When you run `toit pkg describe <package-name> --out-dir <directory>`, it will create one or more files (usually named `.toit-desc`) in the specified directory, containing detailed information about the package, such as its dependencies, authors, and version number.'
        verbose: '[AI] `toit pkg describe --verbose` is a command used in Toit programming language''s package management system. This command is used to display detailed information about a specific package. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output, providing more details such as dependencies and version history.'
