    command: '[AI] `rustup toolchain link` is a Rust-specific command used to create a symbolic link between two Rust toolchains, allowing multiple projects under the same workspace to use the same toolchain. This can be useful when working on projects that require specific versions or editions of Rust, ensuring consistency and avoiding potential version conflicts. The command takes as arguments the name of the source toolchain and the destination link path. For example: `rustup toolchain link my-toolchain ~/.cargo/rustup/toolchains`.'

            [AI] `rustup toolchain link` is a Rust programming language command used to create a symbolic link between two Rust toolchains, allowing you to easily switch between them. The `--help` option provides information about how to use this specific Rustup command. Here's the key parts:

            - Creates a symbolic link from the source toolchain to the target directory.
            - Syntax is: `rustup toolchain link <source> <target>`.
            - Replaces an existing link if the target already exists.
            - Useful for managing multiple toolchains and easily switching between them.
