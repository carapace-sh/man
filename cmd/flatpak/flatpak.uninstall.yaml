documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flatpak uninstall` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to remove installed applications and their associated data. When you run this command followed by the application''s name or bundle ID, Flatpak will delete the specified application from your system, along with its files and settings. This can help free up disk space and remove unwanted software.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `flatpak uninstall --all` is a command used in the Flatpak packaging system to remove all installed applications and their associated data. The `--all` option tells Flatpak to uninstall every application, regardless of which runtime they are installed in. This can be useful when wanting to start with a clean slate or when encountering issues with installed software. It is important to note that this command will permanently delete the applications and their data, so it should be used with caution.'
        app: '[AI] The `flatpak uninstall` command is used to remove applications installed using Flatpak, a popular application packaging and deployment system for Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. The `--app` option specifies that only the specified application should be uninstalled, along with its associated runtimes and dependencies. When you provide an application name as an argument to this command, it will be safely and completely removed from your system.'
        arch: '[AI] The `flatpak uninstall --arch` command is used to uninstall a Flatpak application and its associated files, but keeps the data for other architectures if it exists. The `--arch` option specifies that only the given architecture''s files should be removed. This can be useful when dealing with multi-arch systems, as it allows keeping the data for other architectures while removing the one that is no longer needed.'
        assumeyes: '[AI] `flatpak uninstall --assumeyes` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager for Linux systems. The `--assumeyes` option is used to bypass the confirmation prompt before uninstalling a Flatpak application and its associated files. By using this flag, the user gives explicit consent to perform the operation without being asked for confirmation again. Essentially, it allows for automatic uninstallation of a Flatpak app.'
        delete-data: |-
            [AI] The `flatpak uninstall --delete-data` command is used to remove a Flatpak application and its data from your system. Flatpak is a software deployment and packaging system for desktop applications, which allows for sandboxed execution and easier updating of installed applications.

            When you run this command with the `--delete-data` flag, it will not only uninstall the application but also delete all its local data, including settings, saved game progress, user files, etc. This action is irreversible and should be used with caution if you wish to keep any of the data associated with the application.
        force-remove: '[AI] The `flatpak uninstall` command with the `--force-remove` option is used to remove a Flatpak application from your system along with its data and configurations. This command works by forcefully removing the application, disregarding any dependencies or conflicts that may exist. It''s an all-in-one command to completely uninstall a Flatpak app.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `flatpak uninstall` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. The `--help` option that follows this command displays detailed help information about how to use the `uninstall` sub-command effectively. Here's a brief overview:

            The `flatpak uninstall` command is used to remove a Flatpak application or runtime from your system. With the `--help` option, you will get an explanation of various options that can be used with this command, such as:

            - `--app <app-name>`: Uninstalls a specific Flatpak application by its name.
            - `--runtime <runtime-name>`: Uninstalls a specific Flatpak runtime by its name.
            - `--user` or `--system`: Uninstalls applications for the current user or system-wide, respectively. By default, it uninstalls for both.
            - `--confirm`: Requires confirmation before uninstalling to prevent accidental removal.

            Additional options include `--reactive`, which reacts to running applications when uninstalling, and `--verbose`, which provides more detailed output during the uninstallation process.
        installation: '[AI] The `flatpak uninstall` command with the `--installation` option is used to uninstall a Flatpak application along with its associated runtimes and dependencies from your system. This means that not only will the application itself be removed, but any related software required for it to function properly will also be uninstalled. The command takes the name or the application ID as an argument. For example: `flatpak uninstall --system --installation com.example.app`. This command is typically used when you want to completely remove an application and its associated dependencies from your system.'
        keep-ref: '[AI] The `flatpak uninstall` command with the `--keep-ref` option is used to remove a Flatpak application and its data, while keeping the installed reference of the app. This means that the application can still be reinstalled easily in the future without downloading the entire package again. It''s useful for saving bandwidth or storage space when you want to uninstall an application temporarily.'
        no-related: '[AI] The `flatpak uninstall` command with the `--no-related` option is used to remove a Flatpak application and its associated runtime (a collection of libraries, runtimes, and settings necessary for the app to function) from a Linux system. By using the `--no-related` flag, you are instructing Flatpak not to automatically uninstall related dependencies or packages that were installed only for the use of the specified application. This can help prevent unintended consequences when uninstalling an application.'
        noninteractive: '[AI] `flatpak uninstall` is a command used to uninstall applications installed via Flatpak, a software deployment platform. The `--noninteractive` option is used to suppress interactive prompts during the uninstallation process. This means that the operation will be carried out automatically without asking for confirmation or providing any feedback to the user, making it suitable for scripting and automation tasks.'
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak uninstall` is a command used to uninstall Flatpak applications installed on a system. The option `--ostree-verbose` is used with this command to provide detailed information about the files and directories that are being deleted during the uninstallation process, using the OSTree version control system. This can be helpful for understanding the impact of the uninstallation on your system.'
        runtime: '[AI] The `flatpak uninstall --runtime` command is used to uninstall a Flatpak runtime, which is a collection of libraries and dependencies that Flatpak applications depend on for consistency across different systems. By running this command with the name of a specific runtime, you will remove all applications installed using that runtime along with the runtime itself, freeing up disk space and potentially resolving conflicts between different runtimes or their dependent packages.'
        system: |-
            [AI] The `flatpak uninstall --system` command is used to uninstall a Flatpak application from the system-wide installation, which affects all users on the system. When you run this command, Flatpak removes the application's files and dependencies that are installed in the system directory (usually located at `/var/lib/flatpak/apps`). This operation requires superuser privileges due to the changes made in the system directory.

            For a single application installation, use the format `flatpak uninstall --system <application_name>`. If you need to uninstall multiple applications at once, enclose their names within quotes or escape them with spaces: `flatpak uninstall --system "'<application_1>' '<application_2>'"`.

            Keep in mind that this operation may impact the functionality of other applications if they depend on the uninstalled application. Be sure to consider any potential consequences before executing this command.
        unused: '[AI] The `flatpak uninstall --unused` command is used to remove FlatPak packages that are no longer in use on a system. FlatPak is a software deployment and packaging system for Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. This command scans the installed applications and their dependencies, then removes the unused packages to save disk space and improve system performance.'
        user: '[AI] `flatpak uninstall --user` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager to uninstall applications installed for a specific user on a Linux system. The `--user` option specifies that only applications installed for the current user should be affected, as opposed to system-wide installed applications. This command removes the application''s files and configuration data, but leaves the installed packages in the Flatpak repository untouched, allowing the user to easily reinstall the application later if desired.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak uninstall --verbose` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to remove installed applications or runtimes. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output displayed during the operation, providing more detailed information about the packages being uninstalled, including their versions and dependencies that will be affected. This command does not force the removal of packages with dependencies that are still in use; it only uninstalls the explicitly specified packages.'
