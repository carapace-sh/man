    command: '[AI] The command "tofu test" is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It seems to be a non-standard term without any defined meaning or function in the context of operating systems or software testing.'
    flag:
        compact-warnings: '[AI] The "tofu test --compact-warnings" is a command used in Rust programming language for testing codebase''s warning messages. It runs the test suite with a minimal amount of output, only displaying errors and compact warning messages. Compact warnings hide irrelevant details and make it easier to understand and address warning messages across the entire codebase.'
        junit-xml: '[AI] The "tofu-test-junit-xml" flag is used in JUnit testing framework to enable the generation of an XML report for test results. This XML report, also known as JUnit test result XML or JUnit XML report, contains detailed information about each test case run, including its name, time taken, status (passed or failed), and any assertion failures with their messages. The flag typically takes the value "-xml" or "-junitxml" and is passed to the JUnit test runner when executing tests. This report can be used for further processing and analysis, such as generating trend charts, identifying test case failures, and tracking test coverage over time.'
        no-color: |-
            [AI] The "tofu test -no-color" is a command used in Git, a version control system. It's specifically a filter body used in .gitattributes file for handling text files. The name derives from the use of tofu as an example data with no color or formatting.

            The purpose of this command is to remove all colors and formatting from text files when checking them out of the Git repository, ensuring that the files are viewed in plain text without any unwanted formatting or color schemes. By prefixing it with "-no-", it disables other filters set up for the same file, applying only the "tofu test" filter.
