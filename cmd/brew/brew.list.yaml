flags:
    --cask: List only casks, or treat all named arguments as casks.
    --debug: Display any debugging information.
    --formula: List only formulae, or treat all named arguments as formulae.
    --full-name: Print formulae with fully-qualified names. Unless `--full-name`, `--versions` or `--pinned` are passed, other options (i.e. `-1`, `-l`, `-r` and `-t`) are passed to `ls`(1) which produces the actual output.
    --help: Show this message.
    --multiple: Only show formulae with multiple versions installed.
    --pinned: List only pinned formulae, or only the specified (pinned) formulae if <formula> are provided. See also `pin`, `unpin`.
    --quiet: Make some output more quiet.
    --verbose: Make some output more verbose.
    --versions: Show the version number for installed formulae, or only the specified formulae if <formula> are provided.
    "-1": Force output to be one entry per line. This is the default when output is not to a terminal.
    -l: List formulae and/or casks in long format. Has no effect when a formula or cask name is passed as an argument.
    -r: Reverse the order of the formulae and/or casks sort to list the oldest entries first. Has no effect when a formula or cask name is passed as an argument.
    -t: Sort formulae and/or casks by time modified, listing most recently modified first. Has no effect when a formula or cask name is passed as an argument.

    command: '[AI] The `brew list` command is used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to display a list of all installed packages and their versions. It allows users to easily see which software they have installed via Homebrew and keep track of their installed software inventory.'
    flag:
        "1": '[AI] The command `brew list -1` is a function of Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command generates an unformatted output of a list containing the installed Homebrew packages and their respective paths in the system. In other words, it shows each installed package on a single line with no additional formatting or descriptions.'
        cask: '[AI] `brew list --cask` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command lists out all the installed Homebrew Cask (Cask for short) packages, which are large applications not distributed through the standard Homebrew channels but downloaded and installed as bundles. Each line in the output shows the name of the Cask package, its version number, and the installation path.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew list --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command generates a more detailed output of the brew list command, which lists all installed Homebrew packages and their versions. The `--debug` flag increases the amount of information provided, including debugging information not typically displayed. This can be helpful for troubleshooting or when working with Homebrew''s developers to diagnose issues.'
        formula: '[AI] `brew list --formula` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command displays a list of installed Homebrew packages and their corresponding formulae, which define how each package is built and installed. The output shows the formula name, its version, and installation date, providing an overview of the installed packages and their details.'
        full-name: '[AI] The `brew list --full-name` command is a function of Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command generates an output listing all currently installed Homebrew packages, displaying their full names which include the formulae used to install them. These names usually consist of the package name followed by its version number.'
        help: '[AI] `brew list --help` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command displays help information about the `brew list` command. It lists the various options that can be passed to the `brew list` command to filter or manipulate the output of listing installed Homebrew packages and their versions. Options include filtering by name, installation date, or status (installed or not).'
        l: '[AI] `brew list -l` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command generates a long output listing all installed Homebrew packages along with their versions and installation paths. Each line includes the formula name, version number, install path, and installation date. The flag `-l` stands for "long" format, which produces this detailed output.'
        multiple: '[AI] `brew list --multiple` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command generates an output in which each installed Homebrew package is listed on a separate line with its name and installation path. The `--multiple` option allows the output to be sent directly to another command or file, without any additional formatting or separators added by Brew. It''s commonly used for scripting and automation tasks.'
        pinned: '[AI] `brew list --pinned` is a command used in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. This command lists all the packages (formally called "formulas" in Homebrew) that have been pinned in the Local Tap or Homebrew Cask repository. Pinned packages are versions of formulas that have been explicitly saved with the `brew pin` command to maintain a specific version, rather than automatically updating to the latest version whenever an upgrade is run. The output shows each pinned package and its corresponding version.'

        t: '[AI] `brew list -t` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command lists all currently installed Homebrew packages and their respective formulae locations as text output. The `-t` flag stands for "tabular output," which means the information is displayed in a tabular format for easier reading.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `brew list --verbose` command is used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to display a detailed list of all installed packages and their corresponding versions.
