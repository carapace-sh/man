    command: '[AI] The `git submodule summary` command provides a brief overview of the current state of all submodules in your Git repository, including their names, status (on or offline), and the branch or commit they are currently tracking. This command helps you quickly check the health of your submodules within your main Git project.'
    flag:
        cached: '[AI] `git submodule summary --cached` is a Git command that displays a summary of all the configured submodules in the current Git repository, showing the state of each submodule''s HEAD and the corresponding commit hash in the superproject repository. The "--cached" option filters the output to only show the information from the index (staging area) rather than the working directory.'
        files: '[AI] `git submodule summary --files` is a Git command used to display information about the initialized submodules in your Git repository, along with a list of their files. This can help you quickly identify which files belong to each submodule and verify their current state within your project.'
        summary-limit: '[AI] `git submodule summary --summary-limit` is a Git command used to display a summary of all registered submodules, showing the local and remote repository URLs, branches or commits, and the last commit message for each. The `--summary-limit` option sets the maximum number of lines displayed in the output. This can be useful when dealing with multiple submodules to quickly view their current states without having to scroll through an excessive amount of information.'
