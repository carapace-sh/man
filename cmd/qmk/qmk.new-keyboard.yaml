    command: '[AI] `qmk new-keyboard` is a command used in the Quantum Mechanical Keyboard (QMK) firmware to create a new keyboard project. It initializes a fresh directory with default QMK configuration files and layout templates, allowing you to start designing your custom key mapping and features for your DIY or custom-built mechanical keyboard.'

        help: |-
            [AI] `qmk new-keyboard` is a command used in the Quantum Mechanical Keyboard (QMK) firmware for creating a new keyboard project. The `--help` option provides information about the available arguments and usage of this command. Here's a brief explanation:

            ```
            qmk new-keyboard [options] [project_name]

            Creates a new QMK keyboard project with the given name (optional). The following options are supported:

              --clone              Clones an existing project instead of creating a new one.
                                   Provide the repository URL and branch name as arguments.
              --layout [layout_name]
                                   Creates the project using the specified layout file.
              --keymaps [file]      Path to a keymap file to include in the project.
              --template [template] Path to a template directory to use when creating the project.
              --help               Displays this help message and exits.
            ```

            This command helps you set up a new QMK keyboard project with custom options, such as cloning an existing project, using a specific layout or keymap file, or selecting a custom template for your project.
        keyboard: '[AI] `qmk new-keyboard` is a command used in the QMK firmware platform for creating a new keyboard project. The complete command with an argument, such as `--keyboard my_keyboard`, specifies that the newly created project will be named "my\_keyboard". This command sets up a basic structure for the project, including required files and directories. Once initialized, you can customize the keyboard layout, keys, macros, and features using QMK''s configuration files.'
        realname: '[AI] `qmk new-keyboard --realname` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware framework to create a new keyboard project from scratch. The `--realname` option sets the real name of the keyboard that will be displayed in the QMK Firmware Explorer and other tools. This command generates essential files, including the Makefile and source code for the keyboard layout and configuration.'
        type: '[AI] `qmk new-keyboard --type` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project to create a new keyboard layout. The `--type` option specifies the type of keyboard, such as "keyboard/avr" or "keyboard/split_ortofex". This information helps QMK configure the correct templates and files for the specific keyboard design during the initialization process.'
        username: '[AI] `qmk new-keyboard --username` is a command used in the Quantum Mechanical Keyboard (QMK) firmware to create a new keyboard project. The `--username` option is for specifying a unique GitHub username to be included in the generated QMK repository, enabling easier access and collaboration within the QMK community.'
