    -n, --adjustment=: add integer N to the niceness (default 10)
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nice` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to change the priority of a background process, making it less or more favorable to the system''s scheduler. By default, running `nice <command>` increases the process priority level by 10. This results in the system giving more CPU time to other processes with lower priority levels. The opposite effect can be achieved by using a negative value with the command (e.g., `nice -n 19 <command>`) to decrease the priority level, making the process more favorable for execution.'
    flag:
        adjustment: |-
            [AI] The `nice` command with the `--adjustment` option is used in Linux and Unix systems for prioritizing processes based on their niceness level. Niceness is a value ranging from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority), with 0 being the default value representing normal priority.

            The `--adjustment` option allows you to set a specific niceness level for a process. For example, if you want to give a process lower priority than normal, you can use a higher number like `nice --adjustment=10 my_process`. Conversely, if you want to give a process higher priority, you can use a lower number like `nice --adjustion=-5 my_process`. The system will then allocate CPU resources accordingly.
        help: |-
            [AI] `nice` is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems, which allows you to run commands with adjusted priority levels. By using `nice --help`, you will get a brief explanation of its functionalities. Here's a summary:

            ```
            Usage: nice [OPTION]... [COMMAND]...
            Nicely run COMMAND with adjusted priority.

            Options:
              --10, -n10             Nice by 10 (less nice)
              --20, -n20             Nice by 20 (more nice)
              ...
              --help                 Display this help and exit
            ```

            The `nice` command takes optional priority adjustments (specified using --n followed by a number representing the amount of niceness to increase or decrease), along with the command you wish to run. The more negative numbers you use, the less nice (higher priority) the command will be. Conversely, positive numbers make the command more nice (lower priority).
        version: '[AI] The `nice` command in Unix-based systems is used to change the priority of a running process, making it either nicer or less nice to the system. The option `--version` is used to display the version information of the `nice` utility itself, not the priority of any specific process. So when you run `nice --version`, it will output the version number and other relevant information about the `nice` command installed on your system.'
