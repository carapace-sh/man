    command: '[AI] The `charms sync-keys` command is used in Juju, a service orchestration tool, to synchronize SSH keys between a local machine and Juju charms (templates for deploying and managing applications). This command helps maintain the ability to connect to managed applications without manually copying keys. It ensures that your local SSH keys are replicated to the Juju environment, allowing secure access to application instances when deploying or interacting with them.'
