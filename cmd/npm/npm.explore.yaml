    command: '[AI] The `npm explore` command is not a standard npm (Node Package Manager) command. It seems there might be some confusion, as "explore" is not an official npm command. If you intended to use other npm commands with similar names such as `npm ls` for listing dependencies or `npm search` for searching packages in the npm registry, those commands have well-defined functions within the npm ecosystem.'

            [AI] `npm explore --shell` is a command used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). This command is used to interactively explore the files in a package and its dependencies within an integrated development environment (IDE) or terminal, by opening a Node.js REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) shell.

            It allows users to navigate through the file system using common Node.js commands like `require()`, `fs.readFileSync()`, etc., to understand the package's structure and functionality better. This is particularly useful when debugging, learning a new library or understanding large codebases.
