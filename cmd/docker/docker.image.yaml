    command: '[AI] The `docker image` command is used to manage Docker images. It can be used to list all available images on a system with `docker image ls`, search for images in a registry with `docker image search <image>`, inspect an image''s details with `docker image inspect <image>`, and pull an image from a registry with `docker image pull <image>`. These actions help manage and update Docker containers by ensuring they are running on the latest or desired images.'
