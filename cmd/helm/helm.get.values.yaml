documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `helm get values` command is used with Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. It retrieves the values defined in a Helm chart without installing or upgrading it. The output is in JSON format and can be piped to other commands for further processing. This command provides a way to inspect the configuration data of a chart without affecting the current deployment state.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `helm get values --all` is a Helm command used to retrieve all the configuration values from a Helm chart without installing or upgrading it. The `--all` flag specifies that all charts in the target release should be included, resulting in a merged set of configuration values. These values can then be examined outside of Kubernetes for development or troubleshooting purposes.'
        output: '[AI] `helm get values` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to retrieve the current values of a specified Helm chart. The `--output` flag is optional and specifies how the output should be formatted. Without `--output`, the output will be in YAML format by default. With `--output json`, the output will be in JSON format, which can be more convenient for processing the values programmatically.'
        revision: '[AI] `helm get values --revision` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command retrieves the values of specific keys from the values file of a particular Helm release, specifically from the revision specified. The revision argument refers to the Git commit ID or tag name associated with a Helm release. By using this command, you can inspect and obtain the values of configuration parameters for that specific release state.'
