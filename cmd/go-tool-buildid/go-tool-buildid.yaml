description: Buildid displays or updates the build ID stored in a Go package or binary.
flags:
    -w: write build ID
documentation:
    command: |-
        [AI] `go-tool-buildid` is a command-line tool in the Go programming language used to determine and print the build identities of Go binaries. Build identities include the operating system, architecture, Go version, and build timestamp. This information can be useful for tracking the provenance of binaries during development or deployment processes. The basic usage of the tool is:

        ```sh
        go-tool buildid [<binary-file>]
        ```

        When called without an argument, `go-tool buildid` will print the build identities of the currently executing binary. When called with a binary file as an argument, it will print the build identities for that specific binary instead.
    flag:
        w: '[AI] `go-tool-buildid` is a command-line tool in Go programming language used to set or retrieve build IDs for Go binaries. The `-w` flag stands for "write" and is used to write a new build ID into the specified Go binary file. This flag sets the build metadata, including build timestamp and other information, making it easier to track the build history of your Go applications.'
