flags:
    --help: display this help and exit
    --no-preserve-root: do not treat '/' specially (the default)
    --preserve-root: fail to operate recursively on '/'
    --quiet: suppress most error messages
    --reference=: use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values
    --version: output version information and exit
    -R, --recursive: change files and directories recursively
    -c, --changes: like verbose but report only when a change is made
    -f, --silent: suppress most error messages

documentation:
    command: '[AI] `chmod` is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems for changing the access permissions of a file or a directory. It sets the read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others. The syntax uses a three-digit or an octal number to represent the permissions. For example, "chmod 755 filename" sets the owner to rwxr-xr-x (read, write, execute) and everyone else to read and execute.'
    flag:
        changes: '[AI] `chmod --changes` is a command-line option used with the `chmod` utility in Unix-like operating systems. This option is used to display the changes that would be made by the `chmod` command, without actually applying those changes. It provides a preview of how file permissions will be modified before executing the command. This can be helpful for understanding the effects of complex permission adjustments before implementing them.'
        help: '[AI] `chmod --help` is a command in Unix-based operating systems used to modify file permissions. The `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use the `chmod` command, including valid permission modes (e.g., u+rwx, g+rx, o-w), and the syntax for using symbols or octal numbers to set them. It provides an interactive guide on setting read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others of a file or directory.'
        no-preserve-root: '[AI] The `chmod` command with the `--no-preserve-root` option is used in Unix and Linux file systems for changing file permissions. It modifies the given file or directory''s access rights, but unlike the default behavior where it only affects files and directories under the current working directory, `--no-preserve-root` allows you to change the root directory (/) in the file path as well. This option can be particularly useful when you need to apply chmod commands across different parts of the file system, instead of just the local directory.'
        preserve-root: '[AI] The `chmod` command with the `--preserve-root` option is used in Unix-based systems to change file permissions while keeping the root directory (/) unchanged in the file hierarchy being modified. This option is particularly useful when working on large directories or during scripting, ensuring that any changes made to file permissions do not accidentally modify the root directory''s permissions. It helps maintain the security of the system by preventing unintended modifications to critical directories like `/`.'
        quiet: '[AI] `chmod --quiet` is a command used in Unix-based systems to change file permissions, but with the additional flag `--quiet`, it will only output the success messages without showing any error or warning messages during the execution. This can be useful when running scripts where you want to suppress the normal output for a cleaner experience.'
        recursive: '[AI] `chmod --recursive` is a command used in Unix-based systems for changing file permissions. The `--recursive` option applies the specified permissions not only to the given file or directory but also to all files and directories recursively within it. For example, `chmod --recursive 755 mydirectory` sets the permissions of `mydirectory` and its contents to be owner-executable (7), group-readable (5), and others-readable (5).'
        reference: '[AI] The `chmod --reference` command in Unix-based systems is used to change file permissions based on the permissions of another file or directory. With this option, you specify a reference file or directory using the `--` followed by the path. The new file''s permissions will be set identically to the specified reference file or directory, preserving symbolic links, permissions bits (read, write, execute), and ownership and group information.'
        silent: '[AI] The `chmod --silent` command is a Unix utility used to change file permissions. The `--silent` option is used to suppress the normal output of the command, meaning only error messages will be displayed if any errors occur during the execution of the command. In other words, it runs the chmod command in a quiet mode and does not print the updated file permissions by default.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] The `chmod --verbose` command is used with the Linux `chmod` utility to change the access permissions of a file or directory in a more detailed and explicit way. When this option is applied, `chmod` will print out a clear description of the operation being performed for each file or directory, including the new permission modes (read, write, execute) for the file owner, group, and others, as well as any additional flags such as the setting or clearing of the sticky bit. For instance, `chmod u+rwx file.txt --verbose` will output something like:

            ```bash
            mode of 'file.txt' changed to 0111111 (rwxrwxrwx)
            ```

            This helps in understanding the exact changes made to the file or directory access permissions and provides a clear audit trail for system administrators and developers.
        version: '[AI] `chmod --version` is a command used in Unix-based systems to display the version information of the chmod utility. This command provides details such as the name, release version, and compilation details of the chmod tool installed on the system. It helps users ensure they are using an up-to-date version or check the specifics of the installed version for troubleshooting purposes.'
