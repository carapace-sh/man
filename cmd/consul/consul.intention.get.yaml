documentation:
    command: '[AI] `consul intention get` is a Command Line Interface (CLI) command for Consul, an open-source distributed, highly available, and data center-aware solution to connect and configure applications. This command retrieves the intentional configuration for a specific service or key in the Consul''s intention system. Intention is a feature that helps maintain desired configuration of services and their connections across different Consul agents and datacenters. By executing `consul intention get`, you can check the intended state of your application configuration, helping to ensure that it matches the desired state.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] The `consul intent get --ca-file` command is used in Consul, a Connectivity and Service Discovery tool from Hashicorp. This command retrieves an SSL certificate signing request (CSR) or certificate (CERT) along with its associated CA (Certifying Authority) file in PEM format. The `--ca-file` option specifies the path to save the CA file during the execution of the command. In simpler terms, it fetches Consul intent and returns both the certificate and CA file needed for mutual TLS authentication between services or clients in a Consul service mesh.'
        ca-path: '[AI] The `consul intent get --ca-path` is a command used in Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool. This command retrieves the CA (Certificate Authority) certificate path of an Intent. An Intent represents a desired state for a service in Consul''s service registry. The `--ca-path` option returns the location of the CA certificates that Consul uses to verify the TLS certificates of clients and services in the cluster. This information is important for secure communication between Consul nodes and ensuring trust among them.'
        client-cert: '[AI] The `consul intent get --client-cert` is a command used with Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This command is used to retrieve the client certificate associated with an intention in Consul. An intention represents a desired state for a service or system in a multi-datacenter or dynamic environment. The `--client-cert` flag specifies that only the client certificate related to the intention should be returned, helping secure communication between clients and the Consul server.'
        client-key: '[AI] The `consul intent get --client-key` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, a service discovery and configuration management tool. This command retrieves an intended intent record from Consul''s key-value store (KV), which includes the client key. Intents are used to describe desired state changes for various resources within Consul, such as changing a service registration or updating a configuration value. The `--client-key` option returns the associated client key with the intent record. This information can be useful when automating Consul operations using external tools or scripts.'
        datacenter: '[AI] The `consul intison fig get --datacenter` command is used with the Consul toolkit, which is a Connect and Config management solution by HashiCorp. This command specifically retrieves the current datacenter configuration set in Consul. A datacenter is a logical collection of servers that make up a Consul cluster. The output of this command provides information such as the name and address of each datacenter within the cluster, helping users understand the cluster''s structure and manage services across multiple data centers.'
        http-addr: '[AI] The `consul intent get --http-addr` command is used with Consul, a Connect and Service Mesh platform by Hashicorp. This command is specifically designed to retrieve the HTTP address intent for a particular service in the Consul catalog. An intent represents the desired state of a service or a set of services, including their associated configuration and addresses. The `--http-addr` flag specifies that only the HTTP addresses should be returned in the output.'
        namespace: '[AI] The `consul intent get --namespace` command is used with Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. This specific command retrieves the intentions for a given key or set of keys, filtered by the specified Kubernetes namespace. An intention in Consul represents a desired state for a configurable resource (like a Kubernetes secret or config map), which can be used to manage and synchronize the actual state with the intended state across multiple environments or instances. By specifying a namespace, you can limit the retrieved intentions to only those resources within that particular namespace in a Kubernetes cluster.'
        stale: '[AI] The `consul intent get --stale` command in Consul is used to retrieve data about Intents, which are used for declaring desired state of services and their associated configuration. The `--stale` flag allows retrieving intents even if they''re no longer the current desired state. This can be useful for auditing or understanding past configurations.'
        tls-server-name: '[AI] `consul intent get --tls-server-name` is a command used with the Consul service discovery and configuration tool. This command retrieves the TLS server name (the hostname or IP address to which secure connections are made) for an intention in Consul. Intents represent desired states of services or resources, such as registering a new service instance or updating its configuration. Using `--tls-server-name` option allows you to securely access the intended resource over TLS and ensures that only communication with authenticated and authorized parties is established.'
        token: '[AI] The `consul intention get --token` command is used with Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. This command retrieves an intention token from a Consul server, which represents the desired state of a configuration or system managed by Consul. Intention tokens enable declarative configuration updates with versioning and rollback capabilities, allowing users to specify the desired state and let Consul figure out how to reach that state in a safe and efficient manner.'
        token-file: '[AI] The `consul intent get --token-file` command is used in Consul, a connectivity and service discovery tool, to retrieve an existing token from its storage, and save it into a file. This command is typically run on a machine where Consul is installed and configured, for the purpose of automating tasks or granting access to certain resources requiring Consul authentication. The output is written to the specified file, which can then be used as input when performing other Consul operations that require authentication with a token.'
