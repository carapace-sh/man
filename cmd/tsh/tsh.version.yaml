    command: '[AI] The `tsh version` command is used in Telnet Server (TSH) to display the version information of the installed TSH software, including its major and minor release number, and build date. It helps users identify the specific version of TSH they are running and check for any available updates.'
    flag:
        client: |-
            [AI] The `tsh version --client` command is used with Tenable's Security Center tool (previously known as Log Correlation Engine, or LCE), which is a component of Tenable's SecuritySuite. This command is run in the terminal or command line interface of a Tenable LCE client, which is an agent installed on a system to collect and forward security data to the central Security Center server for analysis.

            The `--client` option with the `version` command requests that the installed LCE client returns its version information, including its major, minor, and build number. This can be useful in ensuring that all clients are running the latest version, or when troubleshooting issues related to compatibility between the Security Center server and the client software.
        format: |-
            [AI] `tsh` is a command-line tool for managing SSH connections in Taylor Shaw's `tmux` terminal multiplexer. The command `tsh version --format` is used to display the version information of the installed `tsh` and `tmux` software in a customizable format.

            The `--format` option allows you to specify how the output should be formatted. By default, it displays the version number of both `tsh` and `tmux`. For example, output might look like:

            ```
            Last login: Mon Nov 15 21:36:13 2021 from localhost
            Tmux version: 3.2
            Tsh version: 0.37
            ```

            The format string can be customized to display additional information or change the order of displayed data by using placeholders such as `%{VAR_NAME}` in the format string. For more details, you can refer to the `tsh` documentation using the command `man tsh`.
        no-client: '[AI] The `tsh` (Telnet SHell) command `version --no-client` is used to display version information about the TSH client, without running the client part of the application. It provides details such as the version number, compilation options, and license information, helping users identify the specific instance of TSH they are using for troubleshooting or compatibility purposes.'
