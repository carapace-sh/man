documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tsh proxy ssh` is a command used in the Tectonic Secrets Manager (Tsh) tool, which creates an SSH tunnel through a proxy server. The command sets up a secure encrypted connection between your local machine and a remote server via a proxy, allowing access to resources behind a firewall or network restriction. This can be useful for managing applications deployed in clusters such as Kubernetes. The `tsh` part refers to the Tectonic Secrets Manager tool, while "proxy" specifies using a proxy server, and "ssh" signifies that an SSH tunnel is being created.'
    flag:
        cluster: '[AI] The `tsh proxy ssh --cluster` command is a part of the Traffic Server (ts) tool from Apache, which is used for traffic management and load balancing. This specific command sets up an SSH proxy using Traffic Server''s proxying capabilities. The `--cluster` option indicates that this is a cluster setup, allowing multiple backend servers to be connected and load balanced among them. This setup enables secure and efficient SSH connections through the Traffic Server, distributing the workload across several servers for improved performance and reliability.'
