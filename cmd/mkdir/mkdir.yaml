name: mkdir
description: make directories
flags:
    --context=: like -Z, or if CTX is specified then set the SELinux or SMACK security context to CTX
    --help: display this help and exit
    --version: output version information and exit
    -Z: set SELinux security context of each created directory to the default type
    -m, --mode=: set file mode (as in chmod), not a=rwx - umask
    -p, --parents: no error if existing, make parent directories as needed
    -v, --verbose: print a message for each created directory
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `mkdir` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems for creating new directories. The name stands for "make directory." You can create a single new directory by specifying its name as an argument to the command, e.g., `mkdir newdir`. To create multiple directories at once, separate their names with spaces within quotes or backslashes, e.g., `mkdir "newdir1 newdir2"` or `mkdir newdir1/newdir2`. If the specified directories already exist, `mkdir` will return an error message.'
    flag:
        Z: '[AI] The command `mkdir` is used in Unix-based systems for creating new directories. The `-Z` option is a Linux-specific extension to the `mkdir` command, which sets the SELinux (Security-Enforced Linux) context on the newly created directories. This helps maintain the security of files and directories by enforcing access control rules based on the defined contexts.'
        context: '[AI] `mkdir --context` is a command used in Unix-based file systems to create multiple directories with the same hierarchical structure and permissions as an existing directory. The `--context` option causes `mkdir` to copy not only the names of the directories but also their modes (permissions) and ownerships to the newly created ones. It helps maintain consistency across a set of directories, making it useful when creating identical directory structures in different locations or copies of projects with complex directory hierarchies.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `mkdir` is a command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems used to create one or more new directories. The option `--help` is used to display detailed help information about the command's usage. When you run `mkdir --help`, it will output a message that describes the basic syntax of the command, the available options, and their meanings. For example:

            ```
            Usage: mkdir [OPTION]... DIRECTORY...
            Create one or more directories.

            Options:
              -m, --mode=MODE       set file mode (octal)
              -p, --parents         make parent directories as needed
              -v, --verbose         show progress
              --help               display this help and exit
              --version             output version information and exit
            ```

            This output explains that `mkdir` takes one or more directory names as arguments, and it supports several options. The `-p` option is used to create parent directories if they don't already exist, and the `-v` option displays progress messages. The help message also includes an explanation of how to set the file mode with the `-m` option, and it provides information on how to display usage and version information.
        mode: '[AI] `mkdir` is a command in Unix-based operating systems used to create new directories. The `--mode` option is used to specify the file permissions for the newly created directory. It takes a numeric or symbolic mode as an argument. For example, `mkdir --mode=755 directory_name` creates a directory with permission set to rwxr-xr-x for the owner and r-x for others. Similarly, `mkdir --mode=u+rw,o+rx directory_name` sets read and write permissions for the owner (u) and read permissions for others (o).'
        parents: '[AI] `mkdir --parents` is a command used in Unix-based file systems to create multiple levels of directories in one single operation. The `--parents` option ensures that each level of non-existent parent directories is created before creating the final directory. This flag is useful when creating directory hierarchies with guaranteed existence of all parent directories, preventing errors due to missing directories along the path.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `mkdir --verbose` command is used in Unix-based systems to create one or more new directories with a detailed output of each action taken. The `--verbose` option causes `mkdir` to print a message for each created directory, displaying the name of the newly created directory and the full path to it in the file system. This can be helpful for understanding the exact location of the new directories as they are being created.'
        version: '[AI] The `mkdir --version` command is used in Unix-based operating systems to display information about the version of the ''mkdir'' utility installed on the system. When executed in a terminal, it returns output that includes the mkdir program name, its version number, and sometimes additional information such as compilation dates or other relevant details. It helps users to keep track of which version of the mkdir command they are using for troubleshooting and compatibility purposes.'
