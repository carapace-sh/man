    command: '[AI] `tmux choose-client` is a TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) command used to select or switch to a client (a detached session) in the TMUX environment based on its name or index. When you run this command, it presents a list of available clients and allows you to make your selection either by typing the corresponding number or name. This command is particularly useful when managing multiple sessions and helps improve productivity.'
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `tmux choose-client` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer software, used to select a client (a detached session) for further interaction or manipulation. The `-F` option modifies the format of the output, allowing users to customize the display of session information when making a selection. For instance, you might use `-F "#I: #{title}` to display the number and title of each session as you cycle through them using the arrow keys or other methods. In summary, `tmux choose-client -F` is used to select a Tmux client with customizable output formatting.'
        K: '[AI] The `tmux` command `choose-client -K` is used to let the user select among multiple attached clients in a TMUX session. The `-K` option stands for "interactive-mode", which means that tmux will display a menu from which the user can make a selection using the arrow keys or the number keys on their keyboard. The selected client will then become the frontmost one in the session.'
        O: '[AI] `tmux choose-client -O` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. It''s used to select a client (a session or window) interactively from a list and display its output on the terminal. The `-O` flag specifies that only the output of the selected client should be displayed, while the default behavior is to also show its title and status.'
        f: '[AI] `tmux choose-client -f` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that allows you to select and attach to a detached session in the same pane or split window, depending on your configuration. The `-f` flag stands for "force" and it means that if there''s only one session that matches the given criteria, it will be selected directly without showing a list of options. It''s useful when you have multiple sessions with similar names or tags but want to quickly attach to the most recently used or specific one without having to cycle through them.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux` command `choose-client -t` is used to display a list of attached clients in the Tamux terminal multiplexer and prompt the user to select one. The `-t` option stands for "tag", which allows specifying a session or window tag to filter the list of clients. For example, running `tmux choose-client -t main` will only show clients associated with the session tagged as "main". After selecting a client, tmux will attach to it.'
