documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pulumi login` is a command used in Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform, to authenticate your local development environment with a Pulumi registry or cloud provider. When you run this command, it opens a browser window and directs you to the login page for the specified service (for example, AWS, Azure, or a Pulumi registry). After signing in, Pulumi stores the authentication information securely, allowing you to manage resources with your configured account. This simplifies the process of managing access keys and other credentials directly within your Pulumi projects.'
