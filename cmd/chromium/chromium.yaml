documentation:
    command: '[AI] "Chromium" is an open-source web browser project initiated by Google. The name refers to the original coding name for the Google Chrome browser, which is based on Chromium''s source code. Users typically use this term when referring to downloading and installing the Chromium browser itself instead of Google Chrome with additional features like automatic updates and proprietary codecs. When you type "chromium" in a terminal or command prompt, it usually initiates the process of downloading and compiling the source code into an executable file, or points to the installation package for the pre-compiled binary depending on your operating system.'
