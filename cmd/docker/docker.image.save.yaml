        [AI] The `docker image save` command is used to save one or more Docker images as tar archives on the local file system or send them to a registry. This can be done with the following syntax: `docker save <image> [-o <filename>] [-t <tag>]`.

        Here, `<image>` refers to the name of the image to be saved. The optional `-o <filename>` argument specifies the output file name, and the optional `-t <tag>` sets a new tag for the image before saving. If no arguments are provided, Docker will save the image with its original name in a file named `<image>.tar` in the current directory.

        output: '[AI] `docker image save` is a command used to save one or more Docker images as tar archives on the local file system. The `--output` option is used to specify the name and location of the output files. For example, `docker image save --output myimage.tar myimage:latest` saves the image with the tag "myimage:latest" as a tar archive named "myimage.tar". Multiple images can be saved in one go by specifying multiple images or tags separated by spaces.'
