documentation:
    command: '[AI] `groupmod` is a Linux command used to change various attributes of an existing group, such as its name or its GID (Group ID). The basic syntax is: `sudo groupmod [option] <groupname> [new-GID]`. Without the `[new-GID]` argument, it will not modify the Group ID. With options like `--help`, `--gid`, or `--no-dob`, you can display help information, change the Group ID with a new value or prevent creating a new group with the same name if it already exists, respectively.'
    flag:
        gid: '[AI] `groupmod` is a command-line utility in Linux and Unix-based systems used to modify group ID (GID) properties. The command syntax is `groupmod [OPTION]... GROUP [NEW-GID]`. The `--gid` option is an alternative way to specify the new GID directly, instead of using the `NEW-GID` argument. So, `groupmod --gid NEW-GID GROUP` sets the specified group''s GID to `NEW-GID`.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `groupmod` is a command-line utility in Unix-based systems used to modify group properties, such as name or membership. The `--help` option displays detailed usage information when invoked with this command:

            ```bash
            groupmod [OPTION]... GROUP [GROUP...]

            Modify the membership or other attributes of a Linux group.

            Usage: groupmod [OPTION]... [GROUP]

            Options:
              -g, --gid GID      Change the numeric group ID (GID) of GROUP.
              -n, --name NAME    Change the name of the group to NAME.
              --help             Display this help and exit.
              --version          Output version information and exit.
            ```

            This command allows you to modify the group ID (GID) or name using various options like `-g` for changing GID and `-n` for renaming a group with the new provided name. The usage information also includes options for displaying help (`--help`) and version information (`--version`).
        new-name: |-
            [AI] `groupmod` is a command-line utility in Linux and Unix-based systems used for managing group IDs and associated group names. The `--new-name` option is used with `groupmod` to change the name of an existing group. The general syntax is:

            ```bash
            groupmod --new-name NEW_NAME OLD_NAME
            ```

            This command will rename the group with the name 'OLD_NAME' to 'NEW_NAME'. Users belonging to this group will retain their membership. This command requires superuser (root) privileges to execute.
        non-unique: |-
            [AI] `groupmod` is a command-line utility in Linux and Unix systems used to modify group properties such as name or membership. The `--non-unique` option allows you to rename multiple groups with the same new name in a single command.

            For instance, if there are two groups named "developers" with different GID (Group ID), you can use the following command:

            ```bash
            sudo groupmod --non-unique developers new_groupname
            ```

            This command will modify both groups and rename them to 'new_groupname'. Without `--non-unique`, you would have to run this command separately for each group.
        password: '[AI] `groupmod` is a command-line utility in Unix and Linux systems used for managing groups and their associated settings. The `--password` option is used to change the password of an existing group, effectively setting or updating the group''s encrypted password hash. This can be important when creating new groups that will be populated with users using NFS (Network File System) or other networked services where group authentication is required. When using this command, you need to provide a new password as an argument to set the group''s password. For example: `sudo groupmod --password <new_password> <groupname>`'
        prefix: '[AI] `groupmod` is a command-line utility in Unix and Linux systems for managing groups. The option `--prefix=new_name` allows renaming an existing group name to `new_name`. When used with the `groupmod` command, it modifies the group identification (GID) associated with the new name, maintaining the original group members and permissions. For example, `groupmod --prefix oldgroupname newgroupname` would rename the group "oldgroupname" to "newgroupname".'
        root: '[AI] `groupmod` is a command-line utility in Linux for managing groups and their memberships. The option `--root` is used to specify that the new owner of the group should be the root user when creating or modifying a group. This can be useful for system administration tasks where it''s necessary to create or modify groups with root permissions.'
