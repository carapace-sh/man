documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tmux swap-window` is a TMUX keybinding or command that swaps the positions of the currently selected and previously selected windows in the TMUX session. It allows users to easily move between two frequently used windows without having to use other window management commands like `next-window` or `prev-window`. This can be particularly useful for developers working on multiple projects in a single terminal session.'
    flag:
        d: '[AI] `tmux swap-window -d` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that swaps the current and next windows in the horizontal direction, and marks the current window as detached. The "-d" flag indicates that the session should be detached after the swap operation. This means that the session will no longer be attached to a terminal, allowing it to run in the background. After the command is executed, the previous window becomes the new current window.'
        s: '[AI] The `tmux swap-windows` command in Tmux is used to swap the position of two windows in a pane. The `-s` option specifies which pair of windows to swap. For example, if you have two windows labeled `w0` and `w1`, you can swap their positions by running `swap-window -t w1 -t w0`. This command will swap the contents and labels of both windows.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux swap-window` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer used to swap the positions of two windows in the same pane or split panes. The `-t` option specifies target window IDs, allowing you to swap windows with distinct identifiers. For example, if you have two windows numbered 1 and 2, running `tmux swap-window -t 1 2` will make window 1 appear where window 2 currently is, while window 2 takes the place of window 1.'
