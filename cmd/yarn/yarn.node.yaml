    command: '[AI] The `yarn node` command is used to run a Node.js script using Yarn as the package manager. When you execute this command in your terminal or command prompt, followed by the path to your script file (e.g., `yarn node myScript.js`), Yarn will first install any missing dependencies listed in your `package.json` file and then execute the specified script using Node.js. This allows you to manage both your project''s dependencies and script execution with a single build tool.'
