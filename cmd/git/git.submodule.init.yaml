description: Initialize the submodules recorded in the index
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git submodule init` is a Git command used to initialize or set up new Git Submodules in your project repository. When you add a subdirectory in your Git-managed project as a submodule, this command downloads and configures the referenced external repository into that subdirectory, allowing you to manage it alongside your main project. After running `git submodule init`, you can use `git submodule update` to synchronize changes between the parent and submodule repositories.'
