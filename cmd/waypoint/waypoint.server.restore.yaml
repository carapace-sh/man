    command: |-
        [AI] The `waypoint server restore` command is used to restore a Waypoint server to a previous state. Waypoint is an open-source tool for managing and updating infrastructure as code, including Terraform and Docker.

        This command rolls back the server configuration to a specific version or commit, which can be helpful in case of misconfiguration or accidental changes. It's important to note that this action will replace any current customizations or modifications on the server.

        To use this command, you need to specify the restoration point by providing the target branch name, commit hash, or tag associated with the desired configuration. For example:

        ```sh
        waypoint server restore <server-name> <branch-name>
        waypoint server restore <server-name> <commit-hash>
        waypoint server restore <server-name> <tag>
        ```

        Replace `<server-name>` with the name of your Waypoint server and `<branch-name>`, `<commit-hash>`, or `<tag>` with the desired restoration point.
    flag:
        exit: '[AI] The `waypoint server restore --exit` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool to perform a rollback of previously saved Waypoint configuration states and then exit the Waypoint server process. This can be helpful when encountering issues with new configurations or needing to revert back to a known working state. It does not restore the Waypoint server to a running state, but instead exits after performing the rollback.'
