    command: |-
        [AI] The `jj` command is a Vim key sequence used for quick forward and backward navigation through editing changes in a file. The specific sequence `jj operation undo` doesn't exist as-is, but `u jj` can be used instead.

        When you type `u jj`, Vim will undo the last change made to the file (the `u` command), and then immediately yank (copy) the changed text back into the buffer without moving the cursor (the `jj` command). This results in the undo being effectively "undone" or reverted, leaving the file in its previous state.
    flag:
        help: '[AI] The command `jj operation undo --help` is used with JJ, a text editor for JSON and JavaScript files, to undo the last operation or modification made on a file. The `--help` option displays detailed information about this specific command, including its purpose, available options, and usage examples. In essence, `operation undo` is an action that reverses the most recent change or edit made with JJ, while `--help` provides assistance in understanding how to use it correctly.'
        what: '[AI] The `jj` command is a text editor for Vim or Jurymen, and the given flag `--undo` followed by the sub-command `--what` requests the display of the last undo/redo actions taken in the editing session. In simpler terms, it shows a list of the most recent changes made (undo) or reverted changes (redo).'
