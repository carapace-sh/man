        [AI] `xdotool` is a versatile tool for automating interactive tasks in X11-based desktop environments. The `windowreparent` command is used to change the parent window of an existing X11 window. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as making a floating window become a child of another window or vice versa.

        The basic syntax for this command is:

        ```
        xdotool window <ID> windowreparent <PARENT_WINDOW_ID>
        ```

        Replace `<ID>` with the ID (or window handle) of the target window, and `<PARENT_WINDOW_ID>` with the ID of the desired parent window. When executed, this command will change the parent-child relationship between the windows specified, making the targeted window a child or a sibling of the new parent window, depending on your use case.
