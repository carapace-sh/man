documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `systemctl reload` command is used to reload the configuration files of systemd managed services without interrupting their current running state. Essentially, it sends a SIGHUP signal to all processes managed by systemd and restarts those that have a reloading option in their configuration files. This allows changes made to the configuration files to take effect without disrupting the services.'
