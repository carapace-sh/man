    command: |-
        [AI] The `tea labels create` command is used to create new labels in Tectonic, an open-source Kubernetes management system by CoreOS. This command does not directly interact with Kubernetes labels, but rather creates custom labels for use within the Tectonic platform. The basic syntax for this command is as follows:

        ```bash
        tea labels create <label-name> --key <key-name> [--values <value1, value2, ...>]
        ```

        This command takes the following arguments:

        1. `<label-name>`: The name you want to give to the new label.
        2. `--key`: The name of the key that will be associated with this label.
        3. `[--values <value1, value2, ...>]` (optional): A list of values for the label. If not provided, the label is created without any specific values assigned to it.

        The command creates a new custom label within Tectonic's label management system. This can be useful when you want to add additional metadata to your resources or applications managed by Tectonic.
    flag:
        color: '[AI] The `--color` option under the `tea labels create` command in the English tea company''s CLIP (Command Line Interface for Tea) is used to specify that the created label should have colored text or symbols. This option enables the terminal to display labels with colors, making it easier to distinguish different labels at a glance. Without this option, the labels will be displayed in monochrome text only.'
        description: '[AI] `tea labels create --description` is a command used in some tea management systems to create a new label for a specific type or blend of tea. The `--description` option allows users to provide a brief description or name for the label, which will be stored and displayed when managing or searching for that particular tea label within the system.'
        file: '[AI] The `--file` option in Tea''s `create` command is used to specify a file containing configuration data when creating a new Tea project. It takes the path to the file as an argument and reads its contents to set up various project properties, such as the name, description, dependencies, and build scripts. This option allows users to easily customize their projects by providing a separate file for configuration rather than having to pass multiple command-line arguments.'
        login: '[AI] `--login` is an option used with the `tea labels create` command in the `tea-cli` tool, which is part of the Temporal workflow platform. This option indicates that a new label should be created using an OAuth2 access token for authentication. By providing this token, Temporal can create and manage resources on your behalf without requiring you to manually input your credentials each time.'
        name: '[AI] `tea labels create --name` is a command used in the Teaspoon tea management system to create a new label for organizing and categorizing teas. The `--name` argument specifies the desired name for the label. When executed, it creates a new label with the given name and saves it in the Teaspoon system for future use.'
        output: '[AI] `tea labels create` is a command used in the TeaDB database management system to create a new label. The `--output` option specifies where to write the output of the command, either to a file or to standard output. For example, `tea labels create --name mylabel --output myfile.json` will create a new label named "mylabel" and save its JSON representation into the file named "myfile.json". If no output option is provided, the label information will be printed on the console.'
        remote: '[AI] The `--remote` flag in the `tea labels create` command is used to specify a remote Git repository URL as the target for applying labels in Tea, a Git UI and workflow tool. With this option, you can manage and apply labels across multiple repositories from a single interface, making it useful for organizations with multiple projects or teams.'
        repo: '[AI] The `--repo` option in the `tea labels create` command is used to specify a Git repository URL where the created label will be saved. This command is used in Tectonic, an open-source Kubernetes distribution by CoreOS, to create and manage custom labels for Kubernetes resources. By providing the `--repo` argument, you can save your labels to a central repository for easier sharing and management across clusters.'
