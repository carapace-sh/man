description: Send signal to processes of a unit
group: unit
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `systemctl kill` command is used to send a signal to a running systemd service and stop it forcefully. It takes the name or the PID number of the service as an argument, followed by the signal number (default is SIGTERM). For example, `systemctl kill myservice` sends a SIGTERM signal to terminate the "myservice" service. If you want to use a different signal, such as SIGKILL, use `systemctl kill --signal=SIGKILL myservice`.'
