documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tsh` command with the argument `ls` is a Unix-style command used in the TIG terminal emulator and Shell (TIGSH). It stands for "list" and is similar to the Linux/Unix command `ls`. This command displays the contents of the current directory in TIGSH. It can be used to view file and directory names, sizes, permissions, and other metadata.'
    flag:
        all: |-
            [AI] `tsh` is not a widely known command or shell in common use. However, I assume you meant to write about the `ls` command in Unix-like operating systems.

            The `ls` (list) command with the option `--all` or `-a` displays the contents of a directory in a more detailed format. With this flag:

            1. Hidden files and directories (files starting with a dot) are included in the listing.
            2. The output shows file permissions, names, sizes, and modification times for all files (not just regular files but also directories and other special files).
        cluster: '[AI] The command `tsh ls --cluster` is used in Tectonic, a Red Hat open-source platform for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters. This command lists all the available clusters managed by Tectonic within a specific project or namespace. The `--cluster` option filters the output to display only information related to the clusters.'
        format: '[AI] The `--format` option in the `ls` command with the `GNU findutils` implementation, such as `tsh`, is used to customize the output format of the listing. It allows specifying how various pieces of information like file size, permissions, ownership, etc., should be displayed. The user can define their own format string using placeholders for different types of data, which is then printed next to each file or directory in the listing. For instance, `''%-10s %3s %7s %B%f %h\n''` would produce a output where the first column is left justified and occupies 10 characters showing the file type, the second column displays permissions with three characters, the third column shows the file size in seven characters, and the fourth column displays the file name in color based on its type (directory or regular file).'
        no-all: '[AI] The `tsh` command with the arguments `ls` and `--no-all` is a Bash alias or function in Tiger Shaw''s Toor extra utilities for Linux. This specific command lists files and directories in a directory without showing hidden files (dotfiles) and system files (those with names starting with a lowercase dot or uppercase letter followed by a dash). The `--no-all` flag ensures that only regular files are displayed, excluding symbolic links, block devices, character devices, directories, and FIFOs.'
        no-verbose: '[AI] The command `tsh ls --no-verbose` is a Bash alias for Tab Shawock''s `tmux list-windows` and `--no-verbose` is an option to suppress detailed output. It displays the current Tmux windows in a minimal format with just their names, without any additional information such as pane layout or status.'
        query: '[AI] `tsh` is a command-line tool for interacting with the Telescope database, which is used by GitLab and other tools. The command `tsh ls --query` returns a list of objects in the Telescope database that match the given query. The `--query` option specifies the query to use for filtering the results. The exact format of the query depends on the specific data being queried, but it typically involves using logical operators and regular expressions to define the search criteria.'
        search: '[AI] `tsh` is a command-line tool for using Tarantool, a NoSQL database management system. The command `tsh ls --search=<pattern>` lists the keys or space names in the current database that match the given pattern. So, this command searches and displays the names of the databases or spaces that have the specified pattern as a substring in their names.'
        verbose: '[AI] The command `tsh ls --verbose` is a Unix-like terminal command using the Taylor Shell (tsh), a simple and portable shell. The `ls` part of the command is a Unix utility for listing directory contents, while `--verbose` is an option that makes `ls` display additional information, such as file permissions, size, timestamps, and sometimes the files or directories'' full path. So, this command lists the contents of the current directory in a more detailed format.'
