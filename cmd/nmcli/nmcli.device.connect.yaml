        [AI] `nmcli` is a NetworkManager command-line utility for managing network connections. The `connect` sub-command is used to establish a connection to a previously configured network interface or WPA key-managed WiFi network.

        The basic syntax is: `sudo nmcli device connect <interface-name> <connection-name>`

        For example, to connect to a Wi-Fi network named "MyWiFi" with the SSID "mySSID", you would use: `sudo nmcli device connect wifi "MyWiFi" --password myPassword`.

        The command checks for available connections and tries to connect the specified interface to the connection with that name. If the connection doesn't exist, it will fail. Note that running `nmcli` with `sudo` is required in many cases due to NetworkManager permissions.
