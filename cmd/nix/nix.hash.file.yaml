documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command is a utility from Nix Pakages build system used to compute cryptographic hashes of files. When you run `nix-hash file`, it calculates and prints out the SHA-256 or other supported hash of the specified file, ensuring data integrity by verifying its unaltered state.'
    flag:
        base16: '[AI] The `nxhash` is a data integrity checker and file identifier generator from NIXOS. The command `nxhash --base16 <file>` generates a base16-encoded representation of the file''s hash value. This hash represents the digital fingerprint of the file, ensuring its authenticity and integrity by allowing verification against previously stored hashes.'
        base32: '[AI] The `nxhash` is a data integrity tool that generates and checks checksums for files. When using `nxhash` with the base32 option (`--base32`), it generates or checks a checksum in base32 format. Base32 is a compact binary-to-text encoding scheme, which represents binary data as printable ASCII characters. The resulting base32 checksum is smaller and more human-readable than the original binary checksum. When using this command, the file''s contents are hashed, and the output displays the base32 representation of the generated checksum.'
        base64: |-
            [AI] The `nxf flags --base64` command is a feature of Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Un*x systems. This specific usage generates a base64-encoded representation of a file's Nix Hash.

            Nix Hashes are unique digital fingerprints used to ensure the integrity of software packages and their dependencies managed by Nix. The `--base64` flag converts the raw hash value into an encoded format, making it easier to handle and share in text form over various communication channels.
        debug: '[AI] The `nxf hash file --debug` command is a utility from the Nix Package Manager used for generating and querying cryptographic hashes of files or directories in the Nix expression language environment. The `--debug` flag enables more detailed output during the execution of the command, providing additional information about the input files'' hashes and the hash algorithm being used. This can be helpful for debugging and verifying the correctness of the hash computations.'
        log-format: |-
            [AI] The `nix-store` is a part of Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It manages software packages and their dependencies in a deterministic way by storing each version of a package as a immutable archive with a unique hash.

            The command `flag "nix hash" --log-format` is used to customize the output format of the `nix-store hash` command which calculates and prints the cryptographic hash of files or paths in the Nix store. The `--log-format` flag specifies how the output should be formatted, for example: "plain", "json" or "human-readable". This allows users to easily integrate the output with other tools or scripts based on their preferences.
        print-build-logs: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command with the `--print-build-logs` flag is used in Nix package manager to compute and print the cryptographic hash of a build output, along with the build logs associated with that output. In other words, it checks the integrity of a built package by comparing its computed hash against the expected one, while also displaying the build logs for troubleshooting or informational purposes.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command with the `--quiet` option is used to compute and display the cryptographic hashes of files in Nix Pakages Manager. When using the `--quiet` flag, only the computed hash values are printed without any additional output or messages.'
        sri: '[AI] The `nxhash` command with the `--sri` option is a tool used in Nix packaging system for calculating and verifying the SHA-256 checksum (referred to as "Size and Root Hash" or SRI) of a file. When you run `nxhash --sri <file>`, it computes the SHA-256 checksum of the given file and prints it out. This checksum is then compared against the expected value in the Nix expression or configuration file to ensure data integrity during package builds or updates.'
        type: '[AI] The `nxhash` is a data integrity checksum tool from the Nix packaging system. The command `nxhash --type` followed by a file path generates a Nix-style hash for that file using its specified hash type, such as SHA1, SHA256, or SHA512. This output can be used to verify the integrity of the file during transfers or package builds in Nix system.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `nxhash` is a tool used to compute SHA-1 and other cryptographic hashes for files and directories in Unix-like systems. The command `nxhash --verbose filename` will calculate the SHA-1 hash of the specified file (`filename`) and print out detailed information about the hash calculation process. This includes the algorithm being used, the length of the hash value in bytes, and a hexadecimal representation of the computed hash. The `--verbose` flag is optional but adds more output to the command for debugging or informational purposes.'
