        [AI] `fgrep` is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems for searching plain text files for fixed strings of text. The name `fgrep` is short for "fixed strings grep," referring to its similarity to the more powerful and flexible `grep` command, which can also search for regular expressions.

        Using `fgrep`, you can quickly find lines containing a specific string in one or more files by specifying the pattern as an argument, followed by the file(s) to search. For example:

        ```bash
        fgrep -l "pattern" file1 file2
        ```

        This command will output the names of the files with lines containing the specified pattern without displaying the actual lines. The `-l` option is used for a listing mode that only displays the filenames. If you want to display the matching lines, simply remove the `-l` option.
