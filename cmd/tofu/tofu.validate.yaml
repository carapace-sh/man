    command: '[AI] The `tofu validate` command is used in the Temporal workflow engine to verify the correctness and validity of a Temporal Workflow Definition (WFD) or Task Template configuration file. It checks for syntax errors, missing dependencies, and other issues that might prevent the successful execution of the workflow or task. The output provides details about any detected problems, allowing users to address them before deploying their workflows or templates.'
    flag:
        json: '[AI] The command `tofu validate --json` is used in TUF (The Update Framework) to verify the integrity and authenticity of JSON-formatted YAML Over TLVS (Yang data models over Transport Layer Security) configuration files or metadata. This validation ensures that the received data is exactly as expected, protecting against potential attacks such as man-in-the-middle or data modification. The --json flag specifies that the input to be validated is in JSON format.'
        no-color: |-
            [AI] The command `tofu validate --no-color` is used in Tufing, a tool for managing and verifying the integrity of configuration files and other data using the TUF (The Update Framework) system.

            This specific command validates the authenticity and integrity of TUF metadata, which includes YAML configuration files and signed data packages. The `--no-color` option is used to suppress color output in the terminal. This can be helpful for scripts or automated processes that don't require colorful feedback.
