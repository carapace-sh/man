documentation:
    command: '[AI] `consul intention list` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. It lists the declarative intentions (desired state) that have been configured for various resources, such as services or configuration entries, in a Consul KV store or through Consul Connect. This helps to verify and compare the current state with the intended state, ensuring consistency and promoting declarative infrastructure management.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] The `--ca-file` flag in Consul''s `intent list` command is used to specify a file containing Certificate Authority (CA) certificates for client TLS authentication. When a service or agent registers with Consul using client TLS, it presents a certificate signed by one of the CA certificates in the provided file. This ensures that only trusted entities can interact with the Consul service using client TLS authentication.'
        ca-path: '[AI] `consul intent list --ca-path` is a command used with Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. This command lists the certificates and their intents in the Consul Connect CA (Certificate Authority) cluster, which is identified by the `--ca-path` flag. The `--ca-path` argument specifies the directory containing the CA bundle file used to sign certificates for secure communication between services in a Consul Connect network.'
        client-cert: |-
            [AI] The `consul intent list --client-cert` command is used with Hashicorp's Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. This command displays the intentions related to client certificates in the Consul data center.

            Intents represent desired state declarations for resources in a Consul configuration, and are used to coordinate updates between different components, such as clients and servers, ensuring a consistent configuration across the cluster.

            With `--client-cert`, the command filters the intent list to show only those intents that relate to client certificates, which can be useful when troubleshooting certificate issues or managing certificates for clients interacting with Consul services.
        client-key: |-
            [AI] The `consul intent list --client-key` command is used with Hashicorp's Consul service discovery and configuration tool. It lists the intended configurations for a specific client with the given client key in the Consul data center.

            Intended configurations represent changes that have been proposed but not yet applied to the live system. By listing these intentions, you can review and approve or reject them before they take effect. This helps maintain control over configuration changes in your environment.
        datacenter: '[AI] The `consul intent list --datacenter` command is used in Consul, a Connect and Service Mesh platform from Hashicorp. This command displays the intended state of resources in a specific datacenter within Consul''s service registry and key-value store. It helps users understand which resources are planned to be created, updated, or deleted, allowing for better coordination and management of their infrastructure.'
        http-addr: '[AI] The `--http-addr` flag in Consul''s Intentions command (`consul intent list`) is used to specify the HTTP address where Consul Connect should listen for client connections. This flag allows users to configure the network bind address for their Consul Connect clients, enabling secure communication between services using TLS certificates managed by Consul. By default, Consul Connect uses the Consul server''s address as its bind address. However, setting `--http-addr` overrides this behavior and sets the custom address instead.'
        namespace: '[AI] The `consul intent list --namespace` command is used with Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. This command lists the intended configurations for resources in a specific Kubernetes namespace. Intended configurations represent the desired state of resources managed by Consul, allowing users to review and approve changes before they are applied to the live cluster.'
        stale: '[AI] The `consul intent list --stale` command is used in Hashicorp Consul to display a list of resources that have been intentionally set in Consul, but may not be currently reflected in the live state due to configuration changes or other issues. The `--stale` flag specifically shows resources with a stale intent, meaning they have been marked as intended to be updated or deleted, but Consul has not yet had a chance to fully propagate those changes. This command can help operators identify and troubleshoot discrepancies between the desired state and the actual state in Consul.'
        tls-server-name: '[AI] The `--tls-server-name` flag in Consul''s Intention List command is used to specify a TLS server name when communicating with the Consul API over a secure connection (HTTPS). It helps ensure that SSL certificate validation is performed correctly and that the Consul client trusts the correct server identity. This flag improves security by verifying the identity of the server before establishing a connection, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks or other potential security threats.'
        token: '[AI] The `consul intent list --token` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, a service discovery and configuration management tool, to list all Intents created by an Authenticated Client with a specific Token. Intents represent desired state configurations for resources, such as services or keys. This command helps administrators keep track of the intended changes made by different clients.'
        token-file: '[AI] The `consul intent list --token-file` command is used with the Consul service discovery and configuration tool. This command lists the intentions file, which specifies desired state for resources managed by Consul Connect, using a token file as authentication. The flag `--token-file` points to the location of the token file that grants access to the Consul API. The intentions file defines rules for how services are discovered and configured, ensuring consistency between desired and actual states in the distributed system.'
