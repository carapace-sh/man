name: pull
description: Run deployments configured within a Benthos Studio session
flags:
    --name=: An explicit name to adopt in this instance, used to identify its connection to the session. Each running node must have a unique name, if left unset a name is generated each time the command is run.
    --send-traces: Whether to send trace data back to Studio during execution. This is opt-in and is used as a way to add trace events to the graph editor for testing and debugging configs. This is a very useful feature but should be used with caution as it exports information about messages passing through the stream.
    --token-secret=: A token secret the session, used to authenticate requests. If left blank the environment variable BSTDIO_NODE_SECRET will be used instead.
    --token=: A token for the session, used to authenticate requests. If left blank the environment variable BSTDIO_NODE_TOKEN will be used instead.
    -s, --session=: The session ID to synchronise with.

    command: '[AI] The `benthos studio pull` command is used in Benthos, an open-source data processing platform, to retrieve and apply the latest changes from a specified Git repository into the Benthos configuration. This helps keep your Benthos setup updated with the latest features and improvements. It takes the URL of the Git repository as its argument. For example: `benthos studio pull <URL>`.'
    flag:
        name: '[AI] `benthos studio pull --name` is a command used in Benthos, an open-source data processing workflow system. This command initiates the process of pulling a specific named workflow from the Benthos Studio registry and downloading it locally for execution.'
        send-traces: '[AI] The `benthos studio pull --send-traces` command is a part of Benthos Studio, an open-source data processing platform. This specific command is used to pull new configurations from the Benthos Studio server and send system traces for debugging purposes back to it. By executing this command, users can ensure their running pipelines have the latest configuration updates, while also providing valuable diagnostic information to help resolve any potential issues more effectively.'
        session: '[AI] The `benthos studio pull --session` command is used in Benthos, an open-source data processing workflow system. This command is designed to fetch and restore the state of a specific session from a Benthos Studio registry. By using this command, you can recover the configuration, pipeline run history, and other metadata associated with that session, allowing for easier experimentation, collaboration, or disaster recovery.'
        token: '[AI] `benthos studio pull --token` is a command used in Benthos, an open-source data processing system. This command is for pulling authentication tokens from the Benthos Studio platform, which allows users to manage and deploy their workflows in a web interface. The token retrieved can be used to authenticate with the Benthos API for automating various tasks such as creating new workflows or updating existing ones.'
        token-secret: '[AI] The `benthos studio pull --token-secret` command is used in Benthos Studio, a toolchain for building and operating data pipelines, to retrieve a previously saved Kubernetes secret as a token. The `pull` action is used to fetch resources from a registry or a remote repository. In this specific case, the `--token-secret` flag indicates that the target resource is a Kubernetes secret containing an access token. This command helps in managing and securing access tokens for various components of your data pipeline without exposing them in plaintext.'
