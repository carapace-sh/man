    command: |-
        [AI] `kubectl config set-context` is a Kubernetes command used to modify the current context in your `kubeconfig` file. A Kubernetes context represents a cluster of servers, namespaces, and user settings. By using `set-context`, you can switch between different clusters or namespaces without having to change the configuration manually each time. The basic usage is:

        ```bash
        kubectl config set-context <new-context> --current-context <previous-context>
        ```

        Replace `<new-context>` with the name of the context you want to switch to, and `<previous-context>` with the name of your current context. This command updates your local `kubeconfig` file so that the next `kubectl` commands use the new context by default.
    flag:
        cluster: '[AI] The `kubectl config set-context --cluster` command is used to switch or set the current context in your Kubernetes configuration file to a specific cluster. This command takes the name of the desired cluster as an argument. Context in this context refers to a collection of cluster and user specific configurations, including the location of the Kubernetes API server, authentication methods, and namespaces. By setting the context, `kubectl` commands will target the specified cluster until another context is set.'
        current: '[AI] `kubectl config set-context --current` is a command used with Kubernetes'' `kubectl` tool to manage configuration settings. This specific command sets the current context in your local `kubectl` configuration file. In other words, it makes the currently active cluster or context the default one for future `kubectl` commands without having to specify the context each time.'
        namespace: '[AI] `kubectl config set-context --namespace` is a command used with the Kubernetes command-line interface (CLI) tool, `kubectl`. This command modifies the context of the current configuration to specify a new namespace for the selected cluster or context. The new namespace value will be applied when executing subsequent `kubectl` commands. This can help manage resources in multiple namespaces across clusters more efficiently.'
        user: '[AI] The `kubectl config set-context --user` command is used to update the user credentials associated with a specific Kubernetes context in your `kubeconfig` file. This command modifies the authentication information, such as client certificate and key or access token and client ID, for a given context. It allows you to switch between different sets of credentials when interacting with multiple clusters or namespaces using the same `kubectl` CLI tool.'
