    command: '[AI] The `tsh` (Tivoli Storage Manager) command `tsh device tpm-activate-credential` is used to activate a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) credential on a IBM TIVOLI Storage Manager system. TPM is a hardware-based security technology designed to protect keys used for encryption and digital signatures. This command activates a specific TPM-protected key or certificate, enabling it for use in TSM operations that require secure data handling.'

            [AI] The `tsh` command with the argument `device tpm-activate-credential --encrypted-trousershoot` is used in the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) environment to activate an encrypted credential stored in the TPM. Here's a brief explanation of each part:

            * `tsh`: This is the name of the command-line tool for interacting with the TPM, provided by the `tpm-tools` package.
            * `device`: This specifies that the following argument refers to a TPM device or object.
            * `tpm-activate-credential`: This is the specific operation to be performed, which involves activating a credential stored in the TPM.
            * `--encrypted-credential`: This option indicates that the credential to be activated is encrypted and requires decryption before activation can take place.

            By using this command, you can activate an encrypted credential in your TPM system.

            [AI] The command `tsh device tpm-activate-credential --encrypted-credential-secret` is a command used in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) subsystem of the TPM Shim (tsh) utility in the Tianocore UEFI firmware.

            This command is used to activate a cryptographically protected TPM credential, which is represented by an encrypted secret. When the command is executed, the TPM driver attempts to decrypt the provided secret using the corresponding key handle stored within the TPM. Once the secret is successfully decrypted, the TPM activates the associated credential and makes it available for use in the system's security processes. The command doesn't output anything if successful but returns an error code if it fails.
