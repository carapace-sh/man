documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint context use` command in Terraform is used to activate a specific Context within Waypoint, Terraform''s cloud-based collaboration platform. Waypoint Contexts enable teams to organize, manage, and apply configurations across multiple Terraform workspaces. By invoking `use` with the name of the desired context, you can switch to that context, which then affects the application of configuration changes in your Terraform projects.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `--app` flag in the `kubectl waypoint context` command is used to specify the name or the Kubernetes application context that should be associated with the Waypoint context being created or updated. Waypoint is a cloud-native application delivery platform, and this flag helps users manage multiple applications deployed across different clusters or environments by allowing them to easily switch between them in their local CLI context.'
        plain: '[AI] The `waypoint context use --plain` command is used in Kubernetes to retrieve the current context in a plain format. The `waypoint` tool is a CLI for managing multicluster applications across multiple clusters, and this specific command returns the active context name without any extra formatting or additional information.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint context use --project` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source multi-cloud application delivery platform developed by Docker. This command sets the current project context for Waypoint. In other words, it specifies which project''s configuration files and resources will be used when running subsequent Waypoint commands. The `--project` option followed by the name or path of the project directory is required to use this command effectively.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `--workspace` flag in the Terraform command `terraform init --reconfigure waypoint context apply` is used with the open-source Terraform module management platform, Waypoint, to specify the working directory of a Terraform configuration. It allows Waypoint to manage and apply infrastructure changes for multiple independent configurations, keeping each one isolated from the others in different workspaces. When `--workspace` is provided along with the name of a workspace, it sets up or selects that particular workspace for further operations.'
