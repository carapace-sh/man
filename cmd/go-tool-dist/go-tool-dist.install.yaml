        [AI] The `go-tool-dist install` command is not a standard Go command, but rather a hypothetical instruction assuming the existence of a tool named `go-tool-dist` with an `install` subcommand.

        Assuming that `go-tool-dist` is a distribution management tool for Go, similar to Homebrew or apt-get for other platforms, the `install` command would be used to download and install specific Go packages or tools from external repositories, making them available for use in your development environment.

        For instance, if you want to install the `sqlite3` command-line tool as part of your Go development setup using this hypothetical `go-tool-dist`, you could run:

        ```bash
        go-tool-dist install sqlite3
        ```

        This would initiate a download and installation process for the given package or tool from its respective repository, making it available to use in your projects.
    flag:
        v: '[AI] `go-tool-dist install` is a command used with the Go programming language''s distribution tool, `go`. This command downloads and installs specified Go versions from the official Go source, maintaining multiple installations on the system. The `-v` flag enables verbose mode, providing detailed output about the progress of the installation process.'
