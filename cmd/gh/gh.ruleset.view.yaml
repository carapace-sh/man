    command: '[AI] `gh ruleset view` is a GitHubActions command used to display the details of a specific ruleset in GitHub.

    flag:
        org: '[AI] `gh ruleset view --org` is a command used in GitHub''s Git HubActions workflow tool, specifically within the context of GitHub''s Advanced Security rulesets. This command allows you to view the details of an organization-level security ruleset that has been applied to your repository. It provides information about the ruleset ID, name, description, and version. By using `--org` flag, it filters the output for organizational rulesets only.'
        parents: '[AI] The `gh` (GitHub) `ruleset view --parents` command is used to display the parent rulesets of a given ruleset in GitHub''s Dependabot security management system. Parent rulesets are those that inherit rules from other rulesets, allowing you to manage and enforce dependencies across multiple projects or organizations in a hierarchical manner. By using this command, you can understand the inheritance structure of your rulesets, ensuring that you have the desired security policies applied at the correct levels.'
        web: '[AI] `gh` is a GitHub command-line tool, and the `ruleset view --web` command is used to view a GitHub Actions workflow ruleset in a web-viewable format. The `--web` flag specifically opens the ruleset in a web browser instead of the default terminal output. This can be helpful for easily viewing and understanding complex workflows with visualizations and interactive features.'
