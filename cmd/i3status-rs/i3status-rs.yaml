documentation:
    command: '[AI] `i3status-rs` is a system status monitor for the i3 window manager. It displays various system information, such as the current date and time, battery status (if applicable), Wi-Fi signal strength, and other system notifications. The "rs" in the command name stands for "realtime," indicating that it updates the displayed information in real-time. Users can customize the output to show only the desired information by editing the configuration file.'
    flag:
        exit-on-error: '[AI] `i3status-rs --exit-on-error` is a command-line argument for the i3status-rs system monitor application. This option causes the script to exit with a non-zero status code upon encountering an error instead of continuing execution and potentially hiding the error message. This can be useful in scripts or automation setups where the presence of errors needs to be detected and handled appropriately.'
        help: '[AI] `i3status-rs --help` is a command used to display help information about the i3status-rs application. i3status-rs is a bar display manager for the i3 window manager. It generates output that can be displayed as a status bar, showing information such as the current date and time, battery level, Wi-Fi signal strength, and other system data. The `--help` option is used to show detailed information about how to use this command effectively, including available options, their meanings, and usage examples.'
        never-pause: '[AI] `i3status-rs --never-pause` is a command used in i3WM (i3 Window Manager) to display system information and custom widgets as a status bar at the bottom of the screen. The `--never-pause` flag ensures that the status bar updates continuously without pausing for user interaction, making it ideal for displays showing real-time information such as system load or network statistics.'
        version: '[AI] `i3status-rs --version` is a command used to check the version information of the i3status-rs application. i3status-rs is a system monitor and status bar application for the i3wm window manager. The `--version` flag requests that the program print out its current version number, usually in the format "i3status-rs [Version]". This can help users ensure they are running the latest or desired version of the software.'
