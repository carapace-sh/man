documentation:
    command: '[AI] `terramate script tree` is a Terraform command used to display the execution plan of a given Terraform script as a tree structure. It shows how the resources in your configuration file depend on one another, helping you understand the order in which Terraform will create and modify infrastructure. The tree includes resource types, instance names, and dependencies between them. This visualization can be helpful for debugging, understanding complex configurations, or verifying that the desired sequence of resource creation is correct before applying changes with `terraform apply`.'
