    command: '[AI] `glab mr note` is a GitLab CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to view the notes associated with a merge request in GitLab. The command requires that you have the GitLab CLI installed and authenticated on your local machine. When executed, it takes the ID or title of the merge request as its argument and displays any comments or discussions attached to that merge request in your terminal or console.'
    flag:
        message: |-
            [AI] The `glab` command with the flags `mr note --message` is used for creating or updating a commit message in a GitLab repository when making merge requests.

            * `glab`: This is the name of the CLI tool for GitLab, which allows users to interact with GitLab through the terminal.
            * `mr`: Stands for Merge Request, which is a feature in GitLab that enables developers to propose changes to a project without directly modifying the main branch.
            * `note`: This flag tells GitLab to create or update a note (also known as an annotation) on the current branch. A commit message and notes can contain additional information about the changes made, which may not be visible in the code itself but are important for understanding the context of the changes.
            * `--message`: This flag is optional, and when it's used, it sets the commit message for the merge request. If this flag is omitted, GitLab will open a text editor for users to enter the commit message interactively.
        unique: '[AI] `glab` is a GitLab CLI tool for interacting with GitLab repositories. The command `glab mr note --unique` is used to view or set the unique note associated with a merge request (MR) in GitLab. The `--unique` flag ensures that only the most recent note for the MR is displayed or set, preventing any potential conflicts due to multiple notes having the same name.'
