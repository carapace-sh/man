documentation:
    command: '[AI] `brew typecheck` is a Homebrew command used for checking type declarations and type compatibility of installed packages written in Objective-C, Swift, or other statically typed languages against their respective type signatures and interfaces. This helps ensure that software dependencies are properly configured and free from type mismatches or errors. By identifying potential issues beforehand, it aids developers in maintaining robust software projects in macOS environments using Homebrew.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `brew typecheck --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs Homebrew''s typecheck tool with debug mode enabled. The typecheck tool analyzes the installed packages and their dependencies to ensure they are correctly linked and configured, preventing potential issues. In debug mode, it provides more detailed output and information about the checks being performed, which can be helpful for troubleshooting and understanding how Homebrew manages dependencies.'
        dir: '[AI] `brew typecheck --dir` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command performs a type check on the files and directories within the currently active directory. Homebrew uses this functionality to ensure that installed packages meet certain dependency requirements and have valid configurations. By using `--dir`, you instruct Homebrew to perform the check in the current directory only, rather than checking the entire system.'
        file: '[AI] `brew typecheck --file` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `typecheck` sub-command performs static analysis on Homebrew''s formulae (scripts that define packages) to ensure their syntax and configuration are valid. The `--file` option specifies the path to a particular formula file for typechecking instead of checking all files in the repository by default.'
        fix: '[AI] `brew typecheck --fix` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to check for type safety and potential issues in installed formulae (Homebrew''s package definitions) and then automatically apply suggested fixes. It scans the installed formulae for any potential type-related errors or inconsistencies and tries to resolve them by applying recommended changes. This can help ensure that your Homebrew installations are healthy and up-to-date with the latest best practices.'
        help: '[AI] `brew typecheck --help` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command invokes Homebrew''s `typecheck` subcommand with the `--help` option. The purpose of this command is to display detailed information about how to use the `typecheck` command effectively. The help output explains that `typecheck` is used to check types of installed Homebrew packages against their declared dependencies, ensuring they are compatible and avoiding potential issues or conflicts.'
        ignore: |-
            [AI] `brew typecheck --ignore` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `typecheck` sub-command performs type checking on installed packages to ensure they are compatible and can be safely upgraded or installed.

            The `--ignore` flag modifies this behavior by ignoring type checking warnings and allowing an upgrade or installation to proceed despite potential compatibility issues. This should be used with caution, as ignoring warnings may result in unintended consequences or package instability.
        quiet: '[AI] `brew typecheck --quiet` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs Homebrew''s typechecker tool to verify that all installed formulas have compatible dependencies. The `--quiet` option suppresses informational output, providing only error messages if any issues are found.'
        suggest-typed: '[AI] `brew typecheck --suggest-typed` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs the Homebrew Typecheck tool, which checks the Swift and Objective-C projects in your Homebrew installations for type compatibility issues and suggests typed extensions to improve type safety. The `--suggest-typed` flag specifically enables the suggestion of typed extensions to enhance the codebase''s type checking capabilities.'
        update: '[AI] `brew typecheck --update` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `typecheck` sub-command performs static type checking on Homebrew''s formulae (packages) using Swift''s Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM). The `--update` option fetches the latest version of these formulae and checks their types against their respective dependencies, ensuring compatibility between components. This command helps maintain and improve the quality and security of Homebrew packages.'
        update-all: '[AI] `brew typecheck --update-all` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command initiates a type checking process using Homebrew''s built-in Typecheck tool. The `--update-all` flag instructs the tool to update the formulae (packages) type definitions in their repositories, ensuring they follow Homebrew''s coding standards and best practices. By running this command regularly, users can maintain a healthy Homebrew installation with well-structured packages.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew typecheck --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `typecheck` sub-command performs a check to ensure that all installed Homebrew packages have compatible dependencies and versions. The `--verbose` flag increases the output level of details provided during the checking process, allowing users to better understand any issues or warnings that may arise.'
