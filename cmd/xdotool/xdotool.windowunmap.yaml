description: Unmap a window, making it no longer appear on your screen
flags:
    --sync: After requesting the window unmap, wait until the window is actually unmapped (hidden)
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `xdotool windowunmap` is a command used in the Linux terminal to unmap or hide the window associated with the specified X11 window ID. When a window is unmapped, it is no longer displayed on the desktop and does not receive input focus. This command is useful for automating tasks that involve hiding windows as part of the process. The window ID can be obtained using other xdotool commands or by querying the window manager. For example: `xdotool windowunmap 0x12345678`.'
    flag:
        sync: '[AI] `xdotool` is a versatile tool for interacting with X11 windows programmatically. The command `windowunmap --sync` is used to unmap (minimize or hide) a specific window by its ID or title in the X11 window hierarchy, and does so synchronously, meaning that the command will wait for the window to be fully minimized or hidden before it returns control back to the terminal.'
