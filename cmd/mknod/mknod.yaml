documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `mknod` command in Unix-based systems is used to create a new file with a given name and set it as a character or block device node. It takes at least two arguments: the first is the pathname of the new node, and the second argument specifies the device type and major/minor numbers. For example, `mknod mydevice.txt c 10 60` creates a file named "mydevice.txt" and sets it up as a character device with major number 10 (e.g., tty) and minor number 60. Without the second argument, `mknod` creates an empty node with no device properties.'
    flag:
        Z: '[AI] The `mknod` command with the option `-Z` is used in Linux to create a named character device or a named FIFO (First In, First Out) file with the given name and specified device type. The `-Z` flag sets the permissions of the file to be acharacter-only file (mode 6000) for a character device or mode 12000 for a FIFO. No data is written to the device or FIFO with this command; it only creates the file with the specified properties.'
        context: '[AI] `mknod` is a command in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems used to create named nodes (charactger or block devices) with given major and minor numbers. The option `--context` sets the SELinux security context for the new node, specifying the type and label of the file based on SELinux policy rules. This can help ensure that the created device is assigned the appropriate access control permissions within the SELinux framework.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `mknod` is a Linux command used to create special files, specifically character and block devices. The `--help` option displays detailed usage information for this command.

            Here's a brief explanation of the help output:

            * `mknod [FILE] [CHAR|BLOCK] [MAJOR] [MINOR]`: This is the basic syntax of the command, where `[FILE]` is the name of the device file to be created, `[CHAR|BLOCK]` specifies whether it's a character or block device, `[MAJOR]` is the major device number, and `[MINOR]` is the minor device number.
            * Options: The command accepts several options like `-m`, which sets the file mode permissions, `-h`, to create a symbolic link instead of a device node, and others.
            * Examples: Help output includes usage examples showing how to use `mknod` for creating character devices (e.g., `mknod mychardev c 10 23`) and block devices (e.g., `mknod myblockdev b 7 1`).
        mode: '[AI] `mknod` is a Linux command used to create named special files, such as character devices or named pipes (FIFOs). The `--mode` option sets the file permissions for the new special file using an octal number representing the read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others. For example, `mknod mydevice.txt c 664` creates a character device named "mydevice.txt" with permissions set to read and write for the owner (6), and read-only for the group and others (4). The total mode is the sum of these numbers: read-write-execute = 7, so 6+4=10, which is binary 110 in octal. Therefore, the mode 664 corresponds to 110-110-140 in octal notation.'
        version: '[AI] `mknod` is a Linux command used to create named character and block devices. The `--version` option is used to display the version information of the `mknod` utility itself, not the devices being created. When you run `mknod --version`, it will output the name of the utility, its version number, and sometimes additional information like compilation dates or commit hashes.'
