    command: '[AI] The `tea issues close` command is used in the Trello project management tool to close an existing issue or ticket on a board. When this command is run, it marks the selected issue as completed and moves it from the active list to the archived list, signifying that the issue has been resolved. It may require additional steps such as entering a reason for closing the issue or confirming the action in a pop-up dialog depending on the board''s settings.'
    flag:
        login: '[AI] The command "tea issues close --login" is related to the use of the Tea project management tool. This command is used to close an issue in Tea with the label "login" associated to it. When you run this command, Tea will mark the specified issue as closed and remove the "login" label from it. The "--login" argument ensures that only issues with the "login" label are affected by the command.'

The `--output` option specifies that the output of the command should be printed to the console instead of being displayed in the user interface. This can be useful for automating tasks or integrating with other tools through scripting.'
        remote: |-
            [AI] The `--tea issues close --remote` command is used with Git, specifically with GitHub or other version control platforms that support Git over SSH. This command closes an open issue in a remote repository using the TEASSH (Text-based Easy Access to GitHub) tool.

            Here's a brief explanation of each part:

            1. `--tea`: It is a shorthand for TEASSH, which is a text-based interface for managing GitHub repositories.
            2. `issues`: It specifies that we are working with GitHub issues and not commits or other GitHub features.
            3. `close`: This command closes the selected issue in the remote repository.
            4. `--remote`: Closes the specified issue in the upstream (original) repository, as opposed to a local branch or fork.
        repo: |-
            [AI] The `--teaproxy-issue-close` flag is a command-line option used with Git operations, specifically push or pull requests, in conjunction with a Git hosting platform like GitHub that uses GitHub Pages for hosting a continuous integration (CI) server such as Jenkins or Travis CI.

            This flag instructs the Git client to close any open issues in the specified repository on GitHub when the operation is successful. The issues are typically associated with pull requests, and their closure indicates that the changes in the request have been successfully built, tested, and merged into the main branch. By automatically closing these issues, developers can ensure a clean and up-to-date issue tracker while streamlining the development process.
