    flag:
        machine-readable: '[AI] `packer inspect` is a command-line tool from Hashicorp''s Packer configuration management software for creating machine images, virtual machine disc images, and container images. The `--machine-readable` flag is used to output the results of an inspection operation in a format that can be easily parsed by other tools or scripts. It generates JSON or HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) formatted output, providing detailed information about the current state and configuration of the machine or image being inspected. This includes data like instance type, AMI ID, security group assignments, network interfaces, disks, etc. The flag is particularly useful for automating tasks and integrating Packer with other CI/CD pipelines or infrastructure management tools.'
