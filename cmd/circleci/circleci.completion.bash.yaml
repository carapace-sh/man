documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `circleci completion bash` command is used to install or update Shell completions for CircleCI in the Bash shell. It adds functionality for tab-completing CircleCI-related commands and options in your terminal. This can make interacting with CircleCI more efficient by reducing the amount of typing required. To use it, add `source <(circleci config --completion bash)` to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file (depending on which shell you''re using), then run `circleci completion bash` to install the completions.'
