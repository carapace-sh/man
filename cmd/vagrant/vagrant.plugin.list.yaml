    command: '[AI] The `vagrant plugin list` command is used to display a list of all the installed plugins in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. It shows the name, version, and whether each plugin is enabled or not. This command helps users keep track of their installed plugins and manage them accordingly.'
    flag:
        local: '[AI] `vagrant plugin list --local` is a Vagrant command used to list all locally installed plugins in your current Vagrant project directory or global configuration. These plugins extend Vagrant functionality and can be used to customize provisioning, box selection, and other aspects of your Vagrant environment. By specifying the `--local` option, you filter the output to only show plugins that are installed locally on your machine rather than plugins managed by a team or project shared via Vagrant Cloud.'
