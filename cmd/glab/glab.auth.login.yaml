documentation:
    command: '[AI] `glab auth login` is a GitLab CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to authenticate and log in to a GitLab instance from the terminal. It establishes a secure connection between your local machine and the GitLab server, allowing you to access your repositories, projects, and other resources with ease. The command interacts with the operating system''s authentication methods to prompt for your username and password, ensuring that sensitive information is not displayed in plain text on the terminal.'
    flag:
        hostname: |-
            [AI] The `glab auth login` command is a part of Glab, GitLab's CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for interacting with GitLab repositories and projects. This specific command is used to log in or authenticate with a GitLab instance.

            The option `--hostname` or `-h` is passed to the command to specify the hostname or URL of the GitLab instance to connect to. It's important for correctly identifying the target GitLab server, especially when dealing with multiple instances.
        stdin: '[AI] `glab` is a GitOps toolkit by Weaveworks for working with GitOps on Kubernetes. The command `glab auth login --stdin` is used to log in to a GitOps cluster using the standard input stream (`--stdin`). It prompts you to enter your username, password, and any other required authentication details interactively through the terminal, which are then encrypted and sent securely to the server. Upon successful login, `glab` saves the authentication information in your local `.glab/config` file for future use.'
        token: '[AI] `glab auth login --token` is a command used in GitLab CI/CD''s glab tool for interactively logging into GitLab using an existing personal access token (PAT). The command prompts you to enter the PAT and then sets up the authentication configuration, enabling you to use `glab` to manage resources within that GitLab instance.'
        use-keyring: '[AI] `glab` is a GitLab CLI tool for interacting with GitLab repositories and projects. The command `glab auth login` is used to authenticate and log in to your GitLab account. The option `--use-keyring` instructs the tool to look up your SSH private key in the system keyring manager before attempting other methods for authentication. This can be useful if you have set up your SSH keys in a secure keyring, allowing for easier and more secure login processes.'
