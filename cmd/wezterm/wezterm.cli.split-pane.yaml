documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `wezterm cli split-pane` command is used in WezTerm terminal emulator to create a new horizontal or vertical split pane within an existing terminal window. It splits the current pane into two equal parts, allowing you to run multiple commands or sessions side by side. To specify the direction of the split (horizontal or vertical), include `--direction="horizontal|vertical"` argument. For example: `wezterm --split-pane --direction=horizontal`.'
    flag:
        bottom: '[AI] The `wezterm cli split-pane --bottom` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for Unix and Windows. This command splits the terminal window into two panes, with the new pane appearing at the bottom of the existing one. It is useful for running multiple commands or applications side by side within the same terminal session.'
        cells: |-
            [AI] The `--cells` option in the `wezterm cli split-pane` command is used to configure the layout of a terminal pane that has been split into multiple parts or cells. Each cell can run an independent command, shell session, or application. The number and size of the cells are determined by other Wezterm flags or options, such as `--split-horizontal` or `--split-vertical`, which indicate how to divide the pane into rows or columns, respectively.

            When using `--cells` with no additional arguments, Wezterm will assume a default layout of one main cell taking up the full pane area and any additional cells being placed below or to the right (for horizontal or vertical splits, respectively). The number and size of these additional cells can be customized by specifying the desired row and column count and dimensions using other flags like `--splits` and `--split-ratio`. For example, `wezterm cli split-pane --cells=3 --splits=2:1,1:2` would create a terminal window with three cells, two of which are arranged in a 2:1 height ratio and placed next to each other (horizontally), while the third cell is located below them.
        cwd: '[AI] The `--flag wezterm cli split-pane --cwd` is a command used in the WezTerm terminal emulator. This command splits the terminal pane horizontally or vertically and sets the current working directory (CWD) of the new pane to the value provided after `--cwd`. For example, `--flag wezterm cli split-pane --left --cwd="/home/user/project"` would open a new left-split pane with the CWD set to "/home/user/project".'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `wezterm cli split-pane --help` command is used to display help information about the Wezterm CLI (Command Line Interface) `split-pane` subcommand. Wezterm is a terminal emulator that allows you to create and manage complex terminal layouts with multiple panes.

            The `split-pane` subcommand is used to split or resize existing panes in the Wezterm terminal window. The `--help` option provides information on how to use this command, including available options such as `--direction`, `--index`, and `--new-width`, which determine the direction of the split, the index of the pane to be affected, and the new width of the panes, respectively.
        horizontal: '[AI] The command `wezterm cli split-pane --horizontal` is used in WezTerm, a customizable terminal emulator, to create a new horizontal split pane within the current terminal window. This means that the terminal window will be divided into two or more equal parts, each running an independent command or session, with the partition between them lying horizontally.'
        left: '[AI] The `wezterm cli split-pane --left` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator, to create a horizontal split pane on the left side of the terminal window. This allows users to run multiple commands or sessions simultaneously within the same window, enhancing productivity.'
        move-pane-id: |-
            [AI] The `wezterm cli split-pane --move-pane-id` command is used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for Unix and Windows, to manipulate split panes. This command moves the pane with the given ID within a tab or the entire window, depending on the context.

            For example, `split-pane --move-pane-id=1 0` will move pane 1 (the one with the ID 1) to the left side of the terminal window and split it evenly with the other panes. Similarly, `split-pane --move-pane-id=2 1` would move pane 2 to the right side.

            These commands can be used to customize the layout of your WezTerm windows by moving and arranging panes as needed.
        pane-id: '[AI] The `--flag wezterm cli split-pane --pane-id` is a command used in Wezterm terminal emulator for splitting the terminal window into multiple panes. This flag creates a new pane with the specified `--pane-id` as an identifier. Splitting the terminal window allows users to run multiple commands or applications side by side within the same terminal session.'
        percent: '[AI] The `--percent` option in the `wezterm cli split-pane` command is used to specify the size of a split pane as a percentage of the terminal window. For example, `--split-pane left 50 --split-pane right 50` would create a horizontal split with each pane taking up 50% of the total window width. The percentages must add up to 100 for valid split configurations.'
        right: '[AI] The `--right` flag in the command `wezterm cli split-pane` refers to splitting the terminal window into two panes with the right pane being the smaller one. This flag is used in Wezterm, a terminal emulator, for creating and managing split windows.'
        top: '[AI] The `--flag wezterm cli split-pane --top` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator, to create a new horizontal split pane at the top of the current terminal window. This allows users to run multiple commands or applications side by side within the same terminal session.'
        top-level: '[AI] The `--split-pane top-level` flag in Wezterm (a terminal emulator) creates a new horizontal split pane at the top level of the terminal window. This means that the window will be divided into two parts: an upper part with the new pane, and a lower part for other content. Each pane can run its own separate command or process.'
