description: Remove unused data
flags:
    --filter=: Provide filter values (e.g. "label=<key>=<value>")
    --volumes: Prune volumes
    -a, --all: Remove all unused images not just dangling ones
    -f, --force: Do not prompt for confirmation
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker system prune` is a Docker command used to remove unused and dangling images, containers, networks, and volumes. It helps to keep the local Docker environment clean and efficient by eliminating resources that are no longer needed but still occupy disk space. By default, it doesn''t delete built images (those with a tag), stopped containers, or named networks and volumes if they are used by at least one container. To remove these as well, use the `--force` or `--all` option.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `docker system prune --all` is a command used in Docker to remove unused and dangling images, containers, networks, and volumes. The `--all` flag instructs Docker to delete these resources not only from the local system but also from the Docker registry if they are configured to be automatically built or pulled from there. This command helps keep the Docker environment clean and efficient by freeing up disk space.'
        filter: '[AI] `docker system prune` is a Docker command used to remove unused objects in the Docker system, including stopped containers, dangling images, and removed volumes and networks. The `--filter` option allows you to apply filters to selectively choose which objects to remove based on their status or type. For example, using `--filters ''dangling=true''` will only remove dangling images. Multiple filters can be applied by chaining them with `and` or `or`. For instance, `--filters ''dangling=true'' and (size<=10M)''` would remove only dangling images smaller than 10MB.'
        force: '[AI] `docker system prune --force` is a command used in Docker to remove unused and dangling images, containers, networks, and volumes. The `--force` option applies the pruning action on both stopped and running resources without asking for confirmation. This command helps keep the Docker environment clean and optimized by eliminating unnecessary data.'
        volumes: |-
            [AI] The `docker system prune --volumes` command is used to remove unused Docker images, containers, networks, and volumes. Among these, the `--volumes` option specifically targets and deletes unused Docker volumes.

            When you run this command, Docker scans your system for any unused volumes that are not being used by active containers or images. These unused volumes consume disk space unnecessarily. By using `docker system prune --volumes`, you can automatically delete these unused volumes to save disk space and improve the overall performance of your Docker environment.

            Keep in mind that this command is irreversible, meaning once you delete a volume, all data contained within it will be permanently lost. It's essential to ensure that you have a backup or a copy of any crucial data before running the `prune` command with the `--volumes` option.
