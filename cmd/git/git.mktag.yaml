documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git mktag` is a Git alias command that automatically creates and updates `TAG` files for annotated tags in a Git repository. It generates the required metadata file (`.gitaggerfile`) for the specified tag, and then calls `git tag` to create or update the tag with the given message and signature information from the default editor or GPG key if configured. This command can help maintain consistent tagging practices and make it easier to manage annotated tags in a Git repository.'
    flag:
        strict: '[AI] `git mktag --strict` is a Git command used to create and update Markdown table-of-contents (TOC) tags in `.md` files based on their corresponding commit messages. The `--strict` option ensures that the TOC is generated only from the first line of each commit message, discarding any trailing sections or appendices that do not begin with a header. This results in a TOC that accurately reflects the main topics covered by each commit, providing better navigation and documentation for the Markdown files.'
