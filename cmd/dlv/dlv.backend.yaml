documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `dlv backend` command in Delve (dlv), the Docker Debugger, is used to specify or change the debugger backend to be used for debugging a running container or image. The default backend is usually the LLDB debugger, but you can use other backends like gdb or pdb. For example, `dlv backend gdb` would tell Delve to use GDB as the debugger. This command is typically used when working with non-standard debugging configurations or specific use cases.'
