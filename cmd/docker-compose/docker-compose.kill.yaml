documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker-compose kill` is a command used with Docker Compose to gracefully stop (signaling) or force stop containers defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. It sends the SIGTERM signal by default, allowing the container processes to finish before shutting them down. If the containers do not terminate within a specified time, `docker-compose kill` can also be used with the `-f` flag to forcefully stop them using the SIGKILL signal.'
    flag:
        remove-orphans: '[AI] `docker-compose kill --remove-orphans` is a command used in Docker Compose to stop and remove containers that have stopped but their dependent services are still running. The `--remove-orphans` option ensures that the containers for services which no longer have any running dependencies are also removed. This can be useful for keeping a clean environment when making changes to your application or infrastructure.'
        signal: '[AI] `docker-compose kill --signal` is a command used to send a specific signal to one or more running containers defined in a Docker Compose file. The `kill` command is followed by the `--signal` option, which allows specifying the signal name (e.g., `SIGTERM` or `SIGKILL`) to gracefully stop the container or forcefully terminate it if necessary. By default, `docker-compose kill` sends the SIGTERM signal.'
