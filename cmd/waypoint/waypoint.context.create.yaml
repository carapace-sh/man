documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint context create` command in Waypoint, a multi-host application deployment tool, is used to create a new context (also referred to as an environment or a profile). A context defines a set of configuration values and target hosts for deploying applications. When you run this command, Waypoint will ask you to provide a name for the new context, along with any necessary configuration details such as the connection method, authentication information, and other settings specific to your deployment targets. Once the context is created, you can use it to deploy and manage applications across your infrastructure.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint context create --app"` is used in Waypoint, an open-source application delivery platform developed by Hashicorp. This command creates a new application context within Waypoint. Application context refers to a set of configurations and environment variables specific to an application. Using this flag initiates the creation of a new context with the given app name. The command sets up the necessary infrastructure for deploying, managing, and scaling the defined application using Waypoint''s declarative configuration files.'
        plain: '[AI] `waypoint context create --plain` is a command used in Waypoint, an open-source application delivery platform by Hashicorp. This specific command creates a new context with a plain YAML configuration file instead of using the default template or a file for defining deployment settings. The "--plain" flag indicates that only a raw YAML configuration will be generated without additional scaffolding or boilerplate code.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint context create --project` command in Waypoint, an open-source application delivery platform by D2iQ, is used to create a new deployment context for a specified Kubernetes project. This command sets the active context within Waypoint to manage and deploy applications to the defined Kubernetes project only. It takes the name of the project as its argument. For instance, `waypoint context create my-project` will create and activate a context named "my-project" for managing resources in that specific Kubernetes project.'
        server-addr: '[AI] The `flag "waypoint context create" with --server-addr` is used in Google Cloud''s Waypoint tool to specify the address of the Waypoint server when creating a new context. Contexts represent different Kubernetes clusters or environments, and by defining the server address, Waypoint knows where to connect and manage resources associated with that context.'
        server-auth-token: |-
            [AI] The `flag "waypoint context create" with the sub-command "--server-auth-token"` is used to create a new Waypoint context in Terraform. Waypoint is an open-source tool for continuous delivery of infrastructure using Terraform.

            This flag sets the value of the server authorization token to be used when creating or updating this context. This is useful when interacting with remote state backends that require authentication, such as Terraform Cloud or other Terraform State files hosting services. By providing the `--server-auth-token` flag, you can securely store and manage your access tokens within Waypoint without exposing them in code or other configuration files.
        server-require-auth: '[AI] The `waypoint context create` command with the `--server-require-auth` flag is used to create a new Waypoint context in your Terraform configuration. This flag indicates that accessing this context requires authentication with the Waypoint server. In other words, you need to provide valid credentials to interact with the infrastructure managed by this context. This adds an extra layer of security to your Terraform workflows by controlling access to specific sets of resources.'
        server-tls: '[AI] The `waypoint context create --server-tls` command is used to create a new Waypoint context with Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption enabled for the communication between the client and the server. Waypoint is an open-source tool used for deploying and managing applications in complex environments. By specifying `--server-tls`, the context configuration includes TLS certificates and keys, enabling secure connections between components of the application infrastructure.'
        server-tls-skip-verify: '[AI] The `--server-tls-skip-verify` flag is used with the `kubectl waypoint` command for creating or updating Kubernetes applications using Waypoint, a GitOps framework for managing Kubernetes applications. This flag disables TLS certificate verification during communication between your local machine and the remote server when creating or updating resources. It''s important to note that using this flag can introduce security risks as it bypasses the standard verification process, making it essential to use it only in trusted environments or when dealing with self-signed certificates.'
        set-default: '[AI] The `kubectl waypoint create` command is used to define and configure a new Kubernetes application using Waypoint, an open-source GitOps tool for Kubernetes. The `--set-default` flag sets the newly created Waypoint module as the default module in a Waypoint project, meaning that it will be automatically synced with the cluster whenever the `waypoint sync` command is run without specifying a particular module. In summary, `kubectl waypoint create --set-default` creates a new Waypoint module and sets it as the default for synchronization.'
        workspace: '[AI] `flag "waypoint context create --workspace"` is used to create a new Waypoint context with a specific workspace directory. Waypoint is an open-source tool for managing Kubernetes applications. This command creates a new context, which is essentially a configuration that holds the connection details and other settings for interacting with a particular cluster or application. The `--workspace` flag specifies the local directory where the codebase for the application will be stored within this context.'
