    command: |-
        [AI] `tmux set-window-option` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to modify various window options. The basic format of the command is: `tmux set-window-option [-g] [-p prefix] [-s session_name] window_id option_name value`. Here's what each part means:

        * `set-window-option`: This is the main command to modify options.
        * `-g` (global): If specified, the option will be set for all windows in the current or target session.
        * `-p prefix`: Specifies a new prefix character for window operations.
        * `-s session_name`: Sets the option for the specific session identified by name.
        * `window_id`: The ID of the window to which the option applies. It can be specified as the index of the current window, or the ID of a named window.
        * `option_name`: The name of the option to modify (e.g., 'mode-key', 'status-bar' etc.).
        * `value`: The new value for the option. It could be a string (e.g., "on") or a boolean (e.g., "true" or "false").
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `tmux set-windowoption` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that allows you to modify various options of a window. The `-F` option sets the status bar format. By using `set-windowoption -F "your_format"`, you can customize the appearance and content of the Tmux status bar for the current window or for all windows in your session by specifying it as an argument to the `new-session`, `new-window`, or other Tmux commands. For example, `tmux new-window -c "your_command" -F "#H:#W: #F{user}@#S: #C{pane_current_path}"` will create a new window and set the status bar format to display the hostname, window number, user, session name, and current pane''s working directory.'
        a: '[AI] The command `tmux set-windowoption -a` is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to modify the attributes of an existing window option. The `-a` flag indicates that the modification should be appended to any existing value for that option, rather than replacing it entirely. For example, you might use `set-windowoption -a synchronize-panes on` to enable pane synchronization in all new windows based on an existing window, or `set-windowoption -a monitoring on` to start monitoring a process in a new pane while keeping the option enabled in the existing one.'
        g: '[AI] The command `tmux set-windowoption -g` is used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to set global window options. The `-g` flag indicates that the option is to be applied to all windows by default. For example, `set-windowoption -g status off` disables the status bar for all windows. Other common uses include setting the window layout (e.g., `set-windowoption -g mode splitw` for splitting windows vertically) or adjusting the display settings (e.g., `set-windowoption -g terminal-cols 200` to set the terminal width to 200 columns).'
        o: '[AI] `tmux set-windowoption` is a command used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to modify window options. The `-o` option is used to reset or toggle an option without setting a new value. For example, `tmux set-windowoption -o mode-keys vi` will toggle vi keybinding mode for the current window. Other possible options include `sync-client`, `detach`, and `bell-action`.'
        q: '[AI] The command `tmux set-windowoption -q` is used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to check if a window option has been set without actually setting it. The `-q` flag stands for "quiet" or "silent," which means that only the presence or absence of the option will be printed on the terminal, and no error message will be displayed if the option does not exist. If the option is already set, nothing will be printed. This command can be used to check the status of a window option without affecting it.'
        t: |-
            [AI] The `tmux` command `set-windowoption` is used to modify various options of a window in the `tmux` terminal multiplexer. The syntax is `set-windowoption -t <window-id> <option> <value>`. Here's a breakdown:

            * `set-windowoption`: This is the command that sets an option for a window.
            * `-t <window-id>`: The `-t` flag followed by a window ID is used to specify which window the option should be applied to. A window ID can be obtained using commands like `list-windows`.
            * `<option>`: This is the name of the option being set. For example, `title`, `mode`, or `status`.
            * `<value>`: The value that the option is being set to. For example, a string value for `title`, or an integer value for `mode`.

            So, the entire command `tmux set-windowoption -t <window-id> <option> <value>` sets the specified option for the window with the given ID.
        u: '[AI] The `tmux` command `set-windowoption -u` is used to unset (remove) an option for a window in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. The `-u` flag indicates that the specified option should be unset. For example, `tmux set-windowoption -u synchronize-panes` would turn off synchronization of panes within a window.'
