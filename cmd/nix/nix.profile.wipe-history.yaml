    --profile=: The profile to operate on
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nix profile wipe-history` command is used to remove the history of previously installed profiles in Nix Pakages Manager. This action helps in reducing disk space usage and improves build performance by eliminating unnecessary data. It does not affect the currently active profile or any system configurations, but only deletes the records of past installations.'
    flag:
        dry-run: '[AI] The `nix-profile wipe-history --dry-run` command is a Nix expression used to simulate the wiping of the Nix expression history without actually performing the action. This operation deletes records of previously installed or configured expressions from the Nix history file, but leaves the actual configuration files intact. The `--dry-run` flag adds an extra level of safety by displaying what would be done without making any changes to the system.'
        older-than: '[AI] The `nix-profile wipe-history --older-than` command is used in Nix packaging system to remove the build and cache logs from the Nix history database. The option `--older-than` followed by a time duration specification (e.g., "1w" for one week or "3d" for three days) instructs the command to delete only the entries that are older than the given time period. This action helps manage disk space and keep the history database from growing excessively large.'
        profile: '[AI] The `nix-profile wipe-history --profile` command in Nix is used to delete the history of profile configurations. When you make changes to your Nix configuration, those modifications are saved in a history file. Running this command will permanently remove that history data associated with the specified Nix profile. This action cannot be undone, so use it with caution if you want to maintain a record of past profile configurations.'
