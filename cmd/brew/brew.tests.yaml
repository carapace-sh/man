documentation:
    command: '[AI] `brew tests` is a Homebrew command used to run tests for installed packages. It automatically finds and runs tests defined by package maintainers using various testing frameworks, helping ensure software reliability and identifying potential issues before usage.'
    flag:
        byebug: '[AI] The command `brew tests --byebug` is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux. This command triggers the testing phase for all installed Homebrew packages in an interactive way using Byebug, a Ruby debugger. It allows users to inspect the flow of execution during the test process and identify any issues that might arise, making it helpful for developers or those troubleshooting package installations.'
        changed: '[AI] The `brew tests --changed` command is a feature of Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs automated tests on only the recently changed Homebrew installations or formulae in your local repository. It helps ensure the correctness and reliability of these specific packages before installing or updating them in your system. The `--changed` option filters the tests to run based on changes detected since the last commit, making the testing process more efficient and focused.'
        coverage: '[AI] `brew tests --coverage` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs tests on all installed Homebrew packages to ensure their correctness and functionality. The `--coverage` option enables code coverage analysis during the testing process. Code coverage reports provide information about which parts of the tested code were executed during the tests, helping developers identify untested or undertested areas in their codebase.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew tests --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command initiates the running of tests for Homebrew''s installed packages (formulas) with enhanced debugging information. The tests help ensure package functionality and compatibility. The debug flag provides more detailed output for better understanding of any issues that may arise during the testing process.'
        fail-fast: '[AI] `brew tests --fail-fast` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs tests on installed Homebrew packages to ensure their correctness and functionality. The `--fail-fast` option causes Homebrew to stop running tests as soon as the first test fails, avoiding unnecessary tests that may consume additional time and resources. In summary, it''s an efficient way to quickly identify failed tests among installed packages.'
        generic: '[AI] The `brew tests --generic` command is a function provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to run tests on all installed Homebrew packages in generic mode. This means it will perform tests without making any modifications to the system or installing new dependencies beyond what''s already required for the package tests. It helps ensure that installed packages are functioning correctly and can identify potential issues.'
        help: '[AI] `brew tests --help` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command displays help information about Homebrew''s built-in testing tool. The testing tool allows users to run tests on installed Homebrew packages to ensure their correctness and compatibility. By providing the `--help` flag, users can learn about various options that can be used with this command, such as specifying particular packages or test suites to run, and controlling the test output format.'
        online: '[AI] `brew tests --online` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command initiates automated testing of installed Homebrew packages against their respective upstream projects. The "--online" option indicates that the tests are run in an interactive session over the network, allowing real-time feedback and progress updates. It helps ensure the health and stability of installed software packages.'
        only: '[AI] `brew tests --only` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs only the tests for installed packages without making any changes to the system. It helps developers ensure that their software functions correctly and identifies potential issues before releasing updates or making new installations.'
        profile: '[AI] `brew tests --profile` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to run tests on installed Homebrew formulae using the specified GitHub user or organization''s profile. This command checks the integrity and functionality of the installed packages by executing their included test suites. It helps ensure that the software remains stable and functional.'
        quiet: '[AI] `brew tests --quiet` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs all tests for installed Homebrew packages in quiet mode, which means it suppresses progress and error messages during the test execution. The primary purpose is to quickly check the overall health of installed packages without being interrupted by extensive output.'
        seed: '[AI] `brew tests --seed` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs tests on Homebrew''s installed packages to ensure their correctness and functionality. The `--seed` option sets a specific seed value for the test randomization to allow for deterministic testing results across different machines. This way, even if tests depend on external factors like network access or system state, they will produce consistent outcomes when run multiple times with the same seed.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew tests --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command runs automated tests for Homebrew''s installed packages to ensure their correct functionality. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output displayed during the test process, providing more detailed information about each test run.'
