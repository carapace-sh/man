description: Delete ALL DATA AND APPLICATIONS INSIDE THIS WINEPREFIX
documentation:
    command: |-
        [AI] `winetricks annihilate` is a command used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux and macOS. This specific command is not a standard one in Wine but rather an alias for the `wineappwinectr` utility with the "annihilate" option.

        The purpose of `winetricks annihilate` is to remove all previously installed Windows software and their associated configurations from the Wine prefix, effectively starting with a clean slate. It's useful when troubleshooting issues or wanting to reinstall applications from scratch. Keep in mind that this command will delete the application data along with their settings, which might result in losing saved game progress or other user-specific configurations.
