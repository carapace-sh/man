The `--format` option specifies the output format of the listing. For example, `--format json` would return the output in JSON format, making it easier to parse and process automatically.'
        from-utc: '[AI] `tsh recordings ls --from-utc` is a command used in the Tshark utility from Wireshark, which lists all available PCAP (Packet Capture) file records with timestamps displayed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This option helps users to easily compare and analyze network traffic data across different systems, as they can rely on a consistent time reference.'

The command `tsh recordings ls --limit` lists the available recording files in Tsung with an optional limit to display a specific number of records. The flag `--limit` followed by a numeric value allows limiting the output to that number of records. For instance, `tsh recordings ls --limit 5` will list only the five most recent recording files.'
