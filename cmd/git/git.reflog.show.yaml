    command: '[AI] `git reflog show` is a Git command that displays the history of a branch or a commit in the form of a log. It shows the sequence of all creation, deletion, and resetting of branches or commits, along with the corresponding messages and author information. This command is useful for recovering lost commits or branches, or for examining the history details that are not available in the standard Git `log` command.'
