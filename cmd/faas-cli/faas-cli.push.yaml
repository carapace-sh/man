description: Push OpenFaaS functions to remote registry (Docker Hub)
flags:
    --envsubst: Substitute environment variables in stack.yml file
    --parallel=: Push images in parallel to depth specified.
    --tag=: Override latest tag on function Docker image, accepts 'latest', 'sha', 'branch', 'describe'
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `faas-cli push` command is used in the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) development with Faas-Netesix toolkit. It is utilized to build and deploy your function code as a container image to a supported FaaS platform such as OpenFaaS or Knative. This process includes building the Docker image, creating a manifest file, and finally pushing the image to the specified registry or provider''s platform. In summary, `faas-cli push` builds, packages, and deploys your FaaS function using the provided configuration.'
    flag:
        envsubst: |-
            [AI] `faas-cli push --envsubst` is a command used in the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) development and deployment toolkit called "Faas-cli." The command is used to build, bundle, and deploy serverless functions written in various programming languages (such as Node.js, Go, or Python), along with their dependencies, to a target cloud provider like AWS Lambda or OpenFaas.

            The `--envsubst` flag is an optional argument that allows the replacement of placeholders in environment variable values with actual values before deploying functions. This way, sensitive information like API keys or database credentials can be securely passed without hardcoding them directly into the function code or committing them to source control. The `--envsubst` flag reads a file named `.env` in the current directory by default, but it can also read from any custom file specified using the `--file` argument.
        parallel: '[AI] `faas-cli push --parallel` is a command used in the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) development with Faas-cli tool. This command pushes multiple functions in parallel to the specified provider''s platform, such as OpenFaaS or AWS Lambda. By using the `--parallel` flag, it increases the efficiency of the function deployment process by executing multiple pushes concurrently instead of sequentially, thus saving time and resources.'
        tag: '[AI] `faas-cli push --tag` is a command used in the FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) development with Faas-netes or other similar tools. It pushes a locally built function container image to a specified registry with the given tag. The image is first built using `faas-cli build`, and then the `push` command is used to upload it to a registry, such as Docker Hub or Amazon ECR, so that it can be deployed and executed in a FaaS environment.'
