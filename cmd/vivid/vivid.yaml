documentation:
    command: '[AI] The term "vivid" is not a command in and of itself, but rather an adjective that describes something with rich and clear detail. It doesn''t have any direct relevance to computers or programming. However, in the context of computer graphics, a "vivid" image or scene would be one that has bright, intense colors and clear, detailed visuals.'
    flag:
        color-mode: '[AI] The `--color-mode vivid` option in some text-based tools, such as terminal emulators or code editors, changes the color palette to display more vibrant and saturated colors. This can enhance the visual experience of using these tools for certain users, making it easier to distinguish between different types of text or symbols. For instance, this setting could be useful when working with complex codebases or debugging logs. However, not all tools support this option or have the same interpretation of what "vivid" means, so its effect may vary.'
        database: '[AI] The `--database` option in Vivid, a data processing pipeline tool, specifies the database management system (DBMS) to be used for storing and managing data. The exact behavior of this option may vary depending on the specific implementation of Vivid, but generally it sets up the connection parameters to interact with the chosen DBMS. Commonly supported databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.'
        help: '[AI] `vivid --help` displays the help message for the Vivid data processing tool. It provides an overview of the available commands and their usage, along with descriptions of each command''s options and arguments. Using this help message allows users to understand how to utilize Vivid effectively in their data processing workflows.'
        version: '[AI] The `--version` option when used with the `vivid` command is intended to display the version information of the installed `vivid` application. It provides details such as the name, version number, and other relevant information about the currently active installation. This can be helpful for checking if an update or new installation is necessary or desirable, as well as confirming the specific version in use for troubleshooting purposes.'
