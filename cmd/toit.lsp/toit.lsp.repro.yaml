documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `toit lsp repro` command is used in TOIT, an open-source programming language and runtime system, to start an LSP (Language Server Protocol) repair session. This command enables text editors or IDEs that support LSP to request corrections for syntax errors, code formatting issues, and other problems from the TOIT Language Server. When invoked, it initializes a connection between the editor and the language server, allowing for real-time feedback and automatic correction suggestions as you type.'
    flag:
        sdk-path: '[AI] The `toit lsp repro --sdk-path` command is used in Toit programming language''s Language Server Protocol (LSP) environment to reproduce an issue with a specific Software Development Kit (SDK) path. The `repro` subcommand is for reproducing issues, and the `--sdk-path` option specifies the location of the SDK to use when attempting to reproduce the issue. This command can be useful in reporting and resolving bugs or inconsistencies within the Toit LSP environment.'
        timeout: |-
            [AI] `toit lsp repro --timeout` is a command used in Toit, a statically-typed, object-oriented programming language. The `lsp` part stands for Language Server Protocol, which is a standardized way for code editors and IDEs to communicate with external code analysis tools.

            The `repro` part refers to the specific Toit language server that's being used. The `--timeout` option sets a time limit for how long the language server should be allowed to run before it is forcefully terminated if it takes too long to respond. This can help prevent potential infinite loops or other issues that might cause excessive resource usage in the code editor or IDE.
