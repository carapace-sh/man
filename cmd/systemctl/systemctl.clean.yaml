        [AI] `systemctl clean` is a command used in Linux systems with systemd initialization to remove unused data from various systemctl caches and journals. It comes with two options:

        1. `--cached`: Clears the cache of the journal files, keeping only the last 7 days' worth of logs.
        2. `--history`: Removes old system state information (transitions between different states) from the journal that is no longer needed.

        By default, this command cleans both caches, making it an effective way to save disk space and manage your system logs efficiently.
