documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vagrant ssh-config` is a Vagrant command used to generate an SSH configuration file for all connected Vagrant machines in your project. This file can then be loaded into your local SSH client (such as OpenSSH) so that you can easily connect to the VMs using the configured keys and settings. It saves the IP addresses, usernames, and ports of your VMs, and also includes any additional SSH options you have set for your Vagrant project. This command simplifies the process of managing multiple SSH connections for different VMs in a single workflow.'
    flag:
        host: '[AI] `vagrant ssh-config --host` is a Vagrant command used to generate an SSH config file based on defined Vagrant hosts. The generated file can be used by the SSH client to easily connect to the Vagrant machines without having to specify the IP address or other connection details each time. The `--host` option specifies the name of the Vagrant host whose configuration should be included in the output.'
