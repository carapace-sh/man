documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker ps` is a command used in Docker to list all currently running containers along with their relevant information. The output displays each container''s name, image, status, creation time, size, and network settings. It provides an overview of the active Docker containers in your system.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `docker ps --all` is a command used in Docker to list all containers currently running or stopped on the local system. The `--all` option includes both exited and running containers in the output. This command provides detailed information about each container such as its ID, image name, status, creation time, network settings, and ports being used. It helps in managing and monitoring Docker containers efficiently.'
        filter: '[AI] `docker ps` is a command used in Docker to list running containers. The `--filter` option allows you to filter the output based on specific conditions. With `--filter`, you can filter by various parameters such as name, status, labels, and more. For instance, `docker ps --filter "name=mycontainer"` will show only the container named "mycontainer". Using multiple filters with `AND` condition is done using `--filter "name=mycontainer --filter status=running"`, which shows containers named "mycontainer" that are running. Filters with `OR` condition can be achieved by chaining multiple filters without an `AND` keyword, e.g., `--filter "name=mycontainer1 --filter name=mycontainer2"`.'
        format: '[AI] `docker ps --format` is a command used in Docker to list running containers with custom output formatting. The `--format` option allows you to specify how the output should be displayed by providing a custom template in Go''s text/template package. This can be useful for automating tasks or extracting specific information from container output, such as container IDs, images, or statuses.'
        last: '[AI] The command `docker ps --last` is used to display the details of the most recently created Docker containers in your system. The `docker ps` command lists all running Docker containers, while the `--last` option filters the output to show only the container that was most recently created.'
        latest: '[AI] The command `docker ps --latest` is used to display the details of the most recently created and running Docker containers on a system. The `--latest` option tells the `docker ps` command to only show the container that was started last, regardless of its current state (running or exited). This can be helpful for quickly identifying which container is the most recent one, especially in environments with multiple containers running at once.'
        no-trunc: '[AI] `docker ps --no-trunc` is a command used in Docker to list all running containers, but without truncating container names that are longer than the default terminal width. The `--no-trunc` flag ensures that the entire name of each container is displayed, even if it extends beyond the normal terminal limits.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `docker ps --quiet` command is used to display a minimal output of running Docker containers in a tab-separated value format. This means that each container''s data will be separated by tabs, making it easier to parse and import the data into other applications or scripts. The `--quiet` option suppresses the display of column headers and other non-essential information, resulting in an output that only contains the essential data for each running container, such as its ID and names.'
        size: '[AI] The `docker ps --size` command is used to display the size of each running Docker container, including their total file size on the host system and the amount of memory and CPU being used. This can help in managing resource usage and identifying large or resource-intensive containers. The output displays the container name, image size, and the memory and CPU usage.'
