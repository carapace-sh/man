    command: '[AI] The "Caps Lock" key is a modifier key on most computer keyboards that toggles the mode in which following keys are pressed: in uppercase letters instead of lowercase ones. Pressing the Caps Lock key once turns it on, and subsequent keys typed will produce uppercase characters until the key is pressed again to turn it off.'
    flag:
        buildtags: '[AI] The `-buildtags` flag in a CAPSLOCK makefile command is used to specify a list of tags for building specific targets. This flag allows selective compilation and linking of source files based on tags, which can be useful for creating multiple builds or configurations from the same codebase. For example, `make -C myproject -buildtags tag1 tag2` will build only the targets with the specified tags `tag1` and `tag2`.'
        goarch: |-
            [AI] The `-flag "capslock -goarch"` is a command-line flag used in Go (Golang) building and compilation processes. This specific flag, `capslock`, is followed by another flag value, `-goarch`.

            The `-goarch` flag determines which architecture or operating system the generated binary file will target. Supported values include `386`, `amd64`, `arm`, `arm64`, `mips`, `mipsle`, `mips64`, `mips64le`, `s390x`, and others.

            The `capslock` flag itself is not a standard Go flag; it is an application-specific flag, which may be defined by a project to control its behavior during the build process. Its exact meaning or function depends on the specific project using this flag.

            In summary, the `-flag "capslock -goarch"` combination sets a custom flag (`capslock`) for a Go project and specifies the target architecture (`-goarch`).
        goos: '[AI] The `-goos` flag in a Go build command, such as `go build -goos linux`, specifies the target operating system for the built Go binary or package. The string `linux` indicates that the output will be compatible with the Linux operating system. The `capslock` portion of the flag is not part of the flag itself, but rather a naming convention used by some projects to easily identify the specific flags being set. So, in summary, `-goos` sets the target operating system for the Go build.'
        noisy: '[AI] The "capslock -noisy" flag is a command-line option for some Unix-based text editors, such as Vim or Emacs. It is used to enable the beep or bell sound each time a key is pressed while in Caps Lock mode. The "noisy" part of the flag indicates that this feature is enabled, resulting in an audible alert with every capitalized keystroke.'
        output: |-
            [AI] The `-output flag` with `capslock` is used to specify an output file for the command's result. When this option is provided followed by a file name, the command outputs its result into that file instead of printing it on the standard output (terminal).

            For instance, if you have a text file named `input.txt`, and you want to convert all the words in it to capitals using the `capslock` command, you would use:

            ```bash
            capslock -i input.txt -o output.txt
            ```

            This command reads from the `input.txt` file, converts the text to caps lock, and writes the output to the `output.txt` file.
        packages: '[AI] The `capslock` is not a recognized flag or option in most common packaging systems like apt, yum, or pacman. The term "capslock -packages" does not have a clear meaning without additional context. It may be a typo or a mistake in the command, and it''s essential to check the correct syntax of the specific packaging system command you intend to use.'
