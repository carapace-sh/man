documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `wezterm cli rename-workspace` command is used to rename a workspace in WezTerm, an advanced terminal emulator. It takes one argument: the new name for the workspace. To use it, you''ll first need to open the WezTerm terminal and connect to a session where you have administrative privileges. Then run the command `wezterm --show-config` to access the configuration files. In the JSON config file, locate the "workspaces" key, find the object corresponding to your workspace, and change the value of the "title" field to the new name. Save and exit the config file, then restart WezTerm for the changes to take effect. Alternatively, you can use `wezterm --rename-workspace <old_name> <new_name>` as a single command to rename a workspace directly without accessing the config files.'

        help: |-
            [AI] `wezterm cli rename-workspace` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator that supports powerful customization and tabbed sessions. This specific command is for renaming existing workspaces programmatically from the command line interface (CLI).

            The `--help` flag provides information on how to use this command effectively. Here's a brief overview:

            ```
            USAGE: rename-workspace [OPTIONS] WORKSPACE_ID NEW_NAME

            Rename an existing workspace by its ID and provide the new name.

            OPTIONS:
              --version, -V             Show application version and exit.
              --help, -h               Display help for this command.
              --workspace-id WORKSPACE_ID
                                      Workspace ID to be renamed. Required.
              --new-name NEW_NAME      New name for the workspace. Required.
            ```

            This command requires you to specify two arguments: the current `WORKSPACE_ID` and the desired `NEW_NAME`. You can also use additional flags like `--version` or `--help` to display more information about the application or the rename-workspace command itself.
        pane-id: '[AI] The `wezterm cli rename-workspace --pane-id` command is a part of WezTerm terminal emulator''s CLI (Command Line Interface). It is used to rename an existing workspace with the given `--pane-id`. Workspaces in WezTerm are separate terminal sessions, and renaming one allows for better organization and identification. The `--pane-id` argument specifies which pane (a single part of a multi-pane terminal session) within the workspace to be renamed. This command is useful when managing multiple terminals with similar content in different workspaces.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `wezterm cli rename-workspace` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator, to rename an existing workspace. The `--workspace` option specifies the name of the workspace to be renamed. For instance, `wezterm cli rename-workspace --workspace old_name new_name` will rename the workspace with the name "old\_name" to "new\_name".'
