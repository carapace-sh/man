documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `resize-pane` command in TMUX is used to resize one or more panes within a TMUX terminal session. It takes the form of `resize-pane -t <target_pane> <width>x<height>` or `resize-pane <direction> <number_of_cells>`. The first syntax resizes the pane with the target tag to the specified width and height. The second syntax resizes the pane in the given direction (up, down, left, or right) by the given number of cells.'
    flag:
        D: '[AI] `tmux resize-pane -D` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to delete the smallest pane in the horizontal direction (the "-D" option stands for "deletion", and "horizontal" is implied since only one direction can be specified at a time). When executed, this command will remove the smallest pane from the current Tmux window layout, allowing you to manually adjust the size of other panes or create a new pane in its place.'
        L: '[AI] The `tmux resize-pane` command with the `-L` option is used in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, to resize the leftmost pane horizontally. Horizontal size adjustments are denoted by the `-L` flag, which stands for "left." This command allows you to modify the terminal layout dynamically, providing greater flexibility while working with multiple panes.'
        M: '[AI] The `tmux` command `resize-pane -M` is used to resize the main pane (the primary pane that fills the terminal window by default) in a Tmux terminal session vertically or horizontally. The `-M` flag indicates that only the master pane should be resized, and not any of its sub-panes. This command is often used when working with a single pane layout and you want to adjust the size of it based on your terminal window''s dimensions.'
        R: '[AI] `tmux resize-pane -R` is a command used in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, to resize the selected pane or all panes in the current window to their maximum size. The "-R" flag stands for "automatic," which means that tmux will adjust the size of the panes based on the available terminal dimensions without requiring explicit width and height values from the user. When run, this command enables Tmux to adapt to any changes in terminal size, making it ideal for use in environments where window dimensions may change frequently.'
        T: '[AI] The `tmux resize-pane` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to resize one or more panes in a TMUX window. The `-T` option sets a title for the pane being resized, making it easier to identify in the TMUX environment. For example, `tmux resize-pane -t main.left 0.15` would resize the left pane in the "main" window to be 15% of the total terminal height.'
        U: '[AI] `tmux resize-pane -U` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, used to resize a pane (a part of a terminal window managed by Tmux) upward. The `-U` option specifies the number of lines to be added to the selected pane. For example, `tmux resize-pane -U 5` will expand the selected pane upwards by 5 lines.'
        Z: '[AI] The command `tmux resize-pane -Z` is used in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, to resize the currently selected pane to occupy the entire height of the terminal window. The `-Z` flag ensures that only the height is adjusted, and not the width, maintaining the aspect ratio.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux resize-pane` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to resize one or more panes in a TMUX session. The option `-t` specifies which pane to resize, using the target pane identifier. For example, `resize-pane -t 0 0` would resize the first pane in the first column of the terminal window.'
        x: '[AI] `tmux resize-pane -x` is a command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, to resize the horizontal width of a pane or split window. The `-x` option specifies that the width should be adjusted. When you run this command followed by the ID or name of the target pane, tmux will adjust its width to fill the remainder of the screen after other panes have been adjusted to their desired sizes.'
        "y": '[AI] `tmux resize-pane -y` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to resize the vertical height of a pane or panes. When run without specifying a pane identifier, it affects the active pane. The "-y" option indicates that only the vertical size is being modified.'
