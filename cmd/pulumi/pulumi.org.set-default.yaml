description: Set the default organization for the current backend
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pulumi org set-default` is a command used in Pulumi, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, to configure the default organization for your account. When you run this command with the name of the target organization, Pulumi sets that organization as the default one for your account. This means that when you create or update stacks using the `pulumi up` command without specifying an organization, it will be applied to the default organization instead. It''s useful for managing multiple organizations from a single Pulumi account.'
