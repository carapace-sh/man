documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `melt completion zsh` command is used to install Zsh completions for the Meltdown and Spectre tools in Linux systems. Meltdown and Spectre are security vulnerabilities that can be mitigated using these tools. The completions help users interact more efficiently with the command-line interface by providing suggestions as they type.'
    flag:
        no-descriptions: '[AI] The command `melt init` is a tool used for creating new projects with preconfigured development environments using Zsh as the shell. The option `--no-descriptions` passed to this command when using `melt completion` disables the display of descriptions while setting up the autocompletion functionality in your shell. This can lead to a faster and more streamlined setup process for experienced users who are already familiar with their projects and don''t need the additional descriptive information.'
