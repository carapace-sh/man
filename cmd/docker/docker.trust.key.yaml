description: Manage keys for signing Docker images
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker trust` command is used to manage trusted registries in Docker. It allows users to add or remove registries as trusted sources, which enables automatic verification of the authenticity and integrity of images downloaded from those registries using Docker''s built-in transport layer security (TLS) functionality. The `docker trust key` subcommand specifically is used to import a new SSL certificate or private key for a registry, which can then be added as a trusted registry using the `docker registry verify` command.'
