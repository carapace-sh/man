description: Renew the certificate for liveness probes to healthcheck etcd
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save the certificates
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubeconfig=: The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster. If the flag is not set, a set of standard locations can be searched for an existing kubeconfig file.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew etcd-healthcheck-client` is a command used to renew the SSL certificate for the ETCD healthcheck client in a Kubernetes cluster managed by `kubeadm`. The ETCD healthcheck client is an important component that checks the status of the ETCD server, which stores the cluster configuration and metadata. Renewing the certificate ensures secure communication between the components, preventing potential security vulnerabilities from expired certificates.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew etcd-healthcheck-client` is a command used to renew the TLS certificates for the Etcd health check client in a Kubernetes cluster managed by `kubeadm`. The `--cert-dir` flag specifies the directory where the new certificates will be saved. This command helps ensure secure communication between etcd and the Kubernetes control plane components.'
        config: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew etcd-healthcheck-client` is a command used to renew the TLS certificates for the Etcd health check client in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. The `--config` option specifies the path to the configuration directory of Kubeadm, which contains the necessary information to perform the certification renewal. This command helps ensure secure communication between the Kubernetes control plane and etcd server.'
        kubeconfig: |-
            [AI] The command `kubeadm certs renew etcd-healthcheck-client --kubeconfig` is used to renew the TLS certificates for the ETCD member's health check client in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubadm. The `--kubeconfig` flag specifies the path to the Kubeadm configuration file, which is used for authenticating with the Kubernetes cluster and issuing commands related to it.

            By running this command, Kubeadm will regenerate the expiring or already expired TLS certificates for the ETCD member's health check client, ensuring secure communication between the etcd-healthcheck-client and the Kubernetes control plane components.
