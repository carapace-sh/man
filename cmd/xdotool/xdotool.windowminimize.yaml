    command: |-
        [AI] `xdotool` is a versatile tool for interacting with the X11 window system programmatically. The `windowminimize` command is one of its actions. It minimizes the specified X11 window to the taskbar or panel without bringing it to the foreground. To use it, provide the window ID as an argument:

        ```bash
        xdotool windowminimize <window_id>
        ```

        Replace `<window_id>` with the actual ID of the target window. You can obtain a window's ID by using other xdotool commands like `search`, `focus`, or `getwindowname`.
    flag:
        sync: |-
            [AI] `xdotool` is a versatile tool for interacting with the X11 window system programmatically. The command `xdotool windowminimize --sync <window_id>` is used to minimize a specific window (specified by its ID) immediately and wait for the minimization process to finish before continuing with other tasks.

            The `--sync` flag ensures that xdotool does not return until the window has been successfully minimized. This can be useful in scripts where you want to make sure that a particular window is indeed minimized before moving on to the next step.
