    command: '[AI] `go mod download` is a command used in the Go programming language to download and install specified dependencies defined in a Go Mod file (go.mod). It resolves the dependency tree defined in the go.mod file, and downloads the required packages and their transitive dependencies from the Go Mod registry into the local $GOPATH/pkg directory. This command is part of the Go Mod initiative introduced to manage and simplify dependency management in Go projects.'
    flag:
        json: '[AI] `go mod download -json` is a command used in Go programming language for retrieving and writing the dependency information of a Go module to a json file. When executed, it will download all required modules specified in the go.mod file and save their metadata (version numbers, import paths) into the json file named go.sum. This command helps to manage dependencies and ensure reproducible builds by checking the integrity of the downloaded modules against the saved information.'
        x: '[AI] The `go mod download -x` command is used in the Go programming language to download and install specific dependencies listed in a `go.mod` file. The `-x` flag indicates that only the listed packages should be installed, rather than updating all dependencies in the current module. This can help ensure consistent dependencies across multiple environments or builds.'
