documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tmux switch-client` is a TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) command that allows you to quickly switch between connected TMUX sessions from the same terminal or from different terminals on the same machine. It brings the selected session into the current window pane, detaching any previously attached session if needed. To use it, specify the session name or number as an argument. For example: `tmux switch-client -t mysession`. If no session is specified, it will cycle through all the sessions in the same server.'
    flag:
        E: '[AI] The `tmux` command `switch-client -E` is used to swap the connection of the current tmux pane or window with that of another tmux session on a different terminal or machine. The `-E` flag stands for "remote-enable", which enables the use of this switch-client command over SSH connections. With this command, you can seamlessly move between multiple terminals or machines while keeping your tmux sessions running in the background.'
        T: '[AI] The `tmux` command `switch-client -T <title>` is used to switch to a existing `tmux` session with a specific title. This can be helpful when you have multiple sessions running and want to quickly navigate between them based on their titles. The `-T` option sets the title for the new window that will open when switching to the session.'
        Z: '[AI] `tmux switch-client -Z` is a command in Tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) which allows you to switch to another client pane or window in the same session, vertically tilting it (Z flag) so that its content is displayed sideways when in split mode. This can be useful for comparing or viewing multiple panes side by side.'
        c: '[AI] `tmux switch-client -c` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer for switching to another client (session or window) while continuing the current process or command in the background. The "-c" flag stands for "detach-on-exit," meaning that once the target client is activated, the current session will detach and run in the background. This can be useful when managing multiple sessions or processes from a single terminal window.'
        l: '[AI] `tmux switch-client -l` is a command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, used to switch to the next pane or window in the same session that has an attached and active terminal. The `-l` flag stands for "latest," which means that the most recently used pane or window will be selected. This command allows users to quickly navigate through their TMUX sessions while keeping track of where they were previously working.'
        "n": '[AI] `tmux switch-client -n` is a command in Tmux, a terminal multiplexer, that allows you to switch to another client (session or window) in the same Tmux server by number instead of name. The `-n` flag specifies that you want to switch using the client number rather than the named alias. For example, if you have two sessions named "session1" and "session2", and they are numbered 0 and 1 respectively, then `switch-client -n 1` would take you to session2.'
        p: '[AI] `tmux switch-client -p` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that allows you to switch to another attached client session, specifically the one with the next highest priority. The `-p` option causes Tmux to display the list of available sessions before switching, allowing you to choose the desired one interactively. It helps users manage multiple terminal sessions efficiently and provides flexibility while working on multiple tasks in parallel.'
        r: '[AI] `tmux switch-client -r` is a command used in the tmux terminal multiplexer to switch to a different client pane or window, based on its session name or number. The `-r` flag stands for "reverse-search" and causes tmux to search for the specified client in the reverse order of their creation. This means that the most recently created client will be switched to first, followed by the next oldest one, and so on. If no client with the given name or number is found, tmux will display an error message.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux switch-client -t` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that allows you to switch to another client (session or window) with the specified target name or index. The `-t` flag specifies the target, which can be given as a session or window name or number. This command helps users efficiently manage multiple sessions and windows within Tmux by allowing them to quickly navigate between them.'
