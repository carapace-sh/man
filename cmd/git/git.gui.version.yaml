        [AI] The `git gui version` command is not a valid Git command as such. The Git GUI (Graphical User Interface) application has its own built-in mechanism to check for its current version. Instead, to check the version of Git GUI in your terminal or command prompt:

        1. Open Git GUI application.
        2. Go to the Help menu and select 'About Git'.
        3. The About Git dialog box will appear displaying the application name, version number, build date, and other details.

        Alternatively, you can check the Git GUI version by examining the executable file's properties or metadata in your operating system (like Windows Properties or macOS Info).
