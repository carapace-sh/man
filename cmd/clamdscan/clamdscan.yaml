documentation:
    command: '[AI] `clamdscan` is a command-line tool used to perform a scan of files and directories for viruses using the Clam Antivirus engine. It scans individual files or entire directories recursively, reporting any detected threats in real time. The results can be displayed on the terminal, or redirected to a file or another application for further processing. It is typically used in automated scripting and system administration tasks for virus scanning purposes.'
    flag:
        allmatch: '[AI] `clamdscan` is a command-line tool used to scan files and directories for viruses and other malware using the ClamAV antivirus engine. The option `--allmatch` is used to specify that only files with 100% matches for known virus definitions should be reported. This means that files which have some or all of the characteristics of a known virus but do not match the definition exactly will not be flagged as infected. By using `--allmatch`, the scan results will only include files that are deemed to be a perfect match with the antivirus database.'
        config-file: '[AI] `clamdscan` is a command-line tool used to scan files or directories for viruses and other malware using the ClamAV antivirus engine. The option `--config-file` allows users to specify a custom ClamAV configuration file instead of using the default one. This can be useful when specific rules need to be applied to the scanning process. The configuration file contains definitions of viruses, their signatures, and other settings for ClamAV.'
        copy: '[AI] `clamdscan --copy` is a command used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software suite. The `--copy` option instructs `clamdscan` to copy scanned files that test positive for viruses or other malware to a specified directory instead of deleting them. This allows for further analysis and decision on the next steps before permanently removing the files from the system.'
        fdpass: '[AI] `clamdscan` is a tool used to scan files for viruses and other malware using the ClamAV antivirus engine. The `--fdpass` option is used to pass file descriptors to `clamdscan` instead of specifying files as arguments. This can be useful when scanning large numbers of files in a piped or automated process, without having to list all the files individually. When using `--fdpass`, each file descriptor is opened and scanned separately by `clamdscan`.'
        file-list: '[AI] `clamdscan` is a command-line tool for Clam Antivirus, an open-source antivirus engine used for scanning files and directories for viruses and other malware. The `--file-list` option is used to specify a file or files containing a list of files to be scanned instead of scanning files interactively. This can be useful when scanning large numbers of files or when automated scanning is required. The file list can be in various formats, such as a text file with one file path per line or a compressed archive containing such lists.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner tool from the ClamAV project. Its `--help` option displays detailed usage information, including:

            * Brief description of the program and its purpose
            * Syntax for invoking it with various options
            * List of available options, such as:
              * `-r`, `--recursive` to scan subdirectories recursively
              * `-H`, `--quiet-progress` to suppress progress messages
              * `-l`, `--list` to display scanned files and their results
            * Examples of usage, such as:
              * `clamscan /path/to/directory` for scanning a directory and its contents
              * `clamscan -r --quiet-progress --list /path/to/directory` for scanning recursively with quiet progress and listing infected files.
        infected: '[AI] `clamdscan --infected` is a command used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software suite. The `--infected` option is used to scan files or directories for viruses and mark any infected files with an "X" in their file names as a quarantine mechanism. This flag does not remove the threats from the files but identifies them instead, allowing administrators to take further actions such as deleting or isolating the infected files from the system.'
        log: '[AI] `clamdscan` is a command-line tool for Clam Antivirus software used to scan files and directories for viruses and malware. The option `--log` enables logging of scan results to a file, providing detailed information about scanned files, their paths, scan status (clean or infected), and other relevant data. This can be useful for analysis, reviewing past scans, or automating responses based on scan results.'
        move: '[AI] `clamdscan --move` is a command-line option for ClamAV''s clamdscan tool, used for scanning files and directories for malware. With this option, any files detected as infected are moved to a quarantine directory instead of just reporting the detection. This allows administrators to review and manage the potentially harmful files separately from the original file system.'
        multiscan: '[AI] "clamdscan --multiscan" is a command used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software suite. The "--multiscan" option tells clamdscan to scan a file using all available scanning engines or detectors instead of just the default one. This can increase the likelihood of detecting viruses, worms, or other malware that may have bypassed individual scanners. The command scans files in real-time as they are accessed and sends the results to the ClamAV daemon for processing.'
        no-summary: '[AI] `clamdscan` is a tool used to scan files or directories for viruses and malware using the ClamAV antivirus engine. The `--no-summary` option is used to disable the display of summary information at the end of the scan, such as the number of scanned files, detected viruses, and error messages. This option is useful when automating scans or integrating ClamAV with other systems, where only the scan results matter and not the summary statistics.'
        ping: |-
            [AI] `clamdscan` is a tool used to scan files and directories for viruses and malware using the ClamAV antivirus engine. The `--ping` option is not a standard feature of `clamdscan`. It seems you might have mistyped or misunderstood the purpose of another option.

            Commonly used options include:
            - `-r`, `--recursive`: Scan a directory recursively, scanning all files and directories under the given path.
            - `-v`, `--verbose`: Show detailed information about each file scanned.
            - `-i`, `--quiet`: Run in quiet mode, suppressing most informational messages.
            - `-l`, `--list`: List scan results without scanning the files.

            For more information on these and other options, refer to the `clamdscan` manual using the command `man clamdscan`.
        quiet: '[AI] `clamdscan --quiet` is a command used in Clam Antivirus software to scan files or directories for viruses and other malware in silent mode. It performs the scan without displaying progress messages or other output to the console, making it ideal for use in scripts or automated processes where you don''t need real-time feedback.'
        reload: '[AI] `clamdscan --reload` is a command used with ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software suite. The `--reload` option is used to reload the ClamAV daemon (clamd) without restarting it. This allows for updating the virus definition database in real-time, ensuring that the latest threats are detected. The `clamdscan` part of the command is a tool for scanning files and directories using the ClamAV engine.'
        remove: '[AI] `clamdscan --remove` is a command used with ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software. The `--remove` option instructs the `clamdscan` tool to scan files and remove any detected malware in quarantine instead of just reporting the infection. This allows automatic elimination of threats from the system without user intervention.'
        stdout: '[AI] `clamdscan --stdout` is a command used in Unix-based systems for scanning files or directories using the Clam Antivirus engine. The `--stdout` option instructs the tool to output the scan results as plain text to the standard output stream instead of creating a report file. This allows further processing or analysis of the scan results using other tools or scripts.'
        stream: '[AI] `clamdscan --stream` is a command used in Unix-based systems for real-time scanning of data as it is being passed through a pipeline or a network connection. The `clamdscan` tool interacts with the ClamAV antivirus daemon (`clamd`) and processes data streams instead of files, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data in a continuous manner. This configuration allows for efficient scanning in environments like intrusion detection systems or data transfer points where real-time monitoring is crucial.'
        verbose: '[AI] `clamdscan --verbose` is a command used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software suite. The `--verbose` option increases the level of output provided during a scan. This means that more detailed information about scanned files, such as their names, scan results, and any detected viruses or threats, will be displayed.'
        version: '[AI] `clamdscan --version` is a command used in Clam Antivirus software environment to check for the version of the ClamAV antivirus engine (clamd) that is currently being used. The command is typically run from a terminal or command prompt, and it returns output displaying the version number of clamd along with other relevant information such as the build date and any available updates. It helps in maintaining an updated antivirus solution by checking the current version against the latest available and ensuring that the system has the most recent protection against known malware threats.'
        wait: '[AI] `clamdscan --wait` is a command used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software. The `--wait` option instructs the `clamdscan` tool to pause its scan and wait for the ClamAV daemon (clamd) to process each scanned file or data stream before moving on to the next item. This can be useful when dealing with large datasets or slow systems, as it allows the daemon to handle the scanning workload more efficiently. When used with `--wait`, `clamdscan` will not continue to the next file until a result from the previous file is received from the clamd daemon.'
