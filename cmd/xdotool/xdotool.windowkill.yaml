documentation:
    command: '[AI] `xdotool` is a powerful and versatile tool for interacting with X11 windows. The `windowkill` command is used to send the `WM_PROTO_CLOSE_REQUEST` message to the specified window, which will trigger its closure. In simple terms, it allows you to kill or close a window using its window ID or title. For example, `xdotool windowkill <WindowID>` or `xdotool search --name "<WindowTitle>" windowkill`.'
