documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `more` command is a text filtering utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It allows users to view the contents of files one page at a time, scrolling forward and backward between pages using keyboard commands. Users can also search for specific text within the file using regular expressions or simple keywords. The `more` command is particularly useful when dealing with large files that would not fit entirely into the terminal window.'
    flag:
        clean-print: '[AI] The `more --clean-print` command is a filter used in Unix-like operating systems to display text one page at a time, with some additional features. The `--clean-print` option is specifically used to remove any formatting codes or control characters that may have been added to the text, ensuring that only pure text is displayed on the terminal. It''s often used in conjunction with other commands like `find` or `sed` to view and inspect the output without unwanted formatting interfering.'
        help: '[AI] The `--help` option is a common command-line argument used in Unix-like operating systems and various applications built for those systems. When passed to a command, it requests that the command print out detailed help information about how to use that command effectively. This includes a brief description of what the command does, options that can be used with it, and their meanings and usage examples. The `more` command is a simple pager utility that allows users to scroll through text one page at a time. Its `--help` option displays information about how to use the `more` command, including available options such as `+n`, `-n`, or `/pattern` for navigating and searching within the displayed text.'
        lines: '[AI] The `more --lines=<number>` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to display the contents of a file one screen at a time, showing <number> lines per screenful. It provides paging and scrolling functionality, allowing users to navigate through longer files with ease. When run without any argument, `more` displays 25 lines by default.'
        logical: '[AI] The `more --logical` flag is a command-line option for the `more` utility in Unix-like operating systems. It is used to display input one screen at a time, but with the added feature of showing each page as a continuous logically contiguous block, without any intervening blank lines or prompts between them. This can be helpful when viewing large files or output that contains long lines which may wrap around when displayed conventionally. It is often used in shell scripts and automated processes where precise control over how output is displayed is necessary.'
        no-pause: '[AI] The `more` command in Unix-based systems is used to display the contents of a file one page at a time, with each page being displayed on the terminal screen. The option `--no-pause` is used to prevent the display from pausing after each page and instead continue displaying the next page automatically without user intervention. In summary, the `--no-pause` option in the `more` command disables the default pause after each page and continues displaying the remaining pages continuously.'
        plain: |-
            [AI] The `more --plain` command is a filter used in Unix-like operating systems for paging and displaying the contents of files or input stream. It's particularly useful when dealing with large files where only parts need to be viewed at a time.

            When invoked with the option `--plain`, it disables the display of various formatting features such as line numbers, file headers, and soft wrapping of lines. This is beneficial for processing input in scripts or when working with text data that may have inconsistent formatting. Essentially, this option presents the data in its most raw and unadorned form.
        print-over: '[AI] The `--print-prefix=<prefix> --print-suffix=<suffix>` options in the `more` command (a Unix utility for paging text output) are used to customize the lines that are displayed before and after each page of output. The `--print-over` option is not a standard `more` option. It seems there might be some confusion or misinterpretation regarding its meaning, as it doesn''t appear in the official documentation for most Unix variants.'
        silent: '[AI] The `more --silent` command is a Unix utility used for paging through large files or output. When `--silent` (or `-s`) option is specified, it disables the display of the `[Page X/Y]` progress indicator at the bottom of the terminal screen, making the output quieter and faster to view. This can be useful when dealing with automated scripts or large data streams where silent processing is desired.'
        squeeze: '[AI] The `more` command in Unix-based systems is used for paging through text files, especially large ones. The option `--squeeze` or `-s` modifies the output by suppressing empty lines between continuous text and by displaying only one blank line between non-empty lines. It results in a more compact and streamlined output.'
        version: '[AI] The `more --version` command is used to display the version information of the `more` utility, which is a Unix pager program designed to allow users to scroll through text files one page at a time. When you type `more --version` in a terminal or command-line interface, it will return output showing the specific version of `more` that''s installed on your system, including its release number and any additional relevant information such as compilation flags used during build.'
