documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker help` command is used to display help information about a specific Docker command or subcommand. When called without any arguments, it displays help for the `dockер` CLI (Command Line Interface). However, you can also use it with a specific command or option, such as `docker help build` or `docker help push`, to display more detailed information about that particular aspect of Docker. This command is invaluable when you need a quick reminder on how to use a certain Docker command or if you''re unsure about the available options for a specific command.'
