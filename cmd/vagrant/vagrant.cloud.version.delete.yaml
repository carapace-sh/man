description: Deletes a version entry on Vagrant Cloud
flags:
    --no-force: Do not force deletion without confirmation
    -f, --force: Force deletion without confirmation
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud version delete` command is used to remove a specific version of a Vagrantbox (a pre-packaged virtual machine) from the Hashicorp Vagrant Cloud repository. When you run this command, you need to provide the name of the box and its version number as arguments. The command will then send a request to the Vagrant Cloud server to delete the specified version of the box. Once deleted, other users who may be using that version in their projects will need to update their Vagrantfiles to use a different version or remove the reference to the deleted box altogether.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The `vagrant cloud version delete --force` command is used to permanently delete a specific version of a Vagrant box from the Vagrant Cloud repository. This action cannot be undone, as the --force option overrides any potential errors or confirmations. When you use this command followed by the box name and version number, Vagrant will initiate the deletion process, and the specified box version will no longer be accessible to other users.'
        no-force: |-
            [AI] The `vagrant cloud version delete --no-force` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command deletes a specific version of a box (a pre-packaged virtual environment) from the Vagrant Cloud repository with force disabled.

            The `--no-force` option prevents the deletion if there are any dependent boxes or configurations that use the version to be deleted. If you're certain that no dependencies exist, you can use the `--force` option instead to bypass this check and delete the box version anyway.

            Using this command helps in managing your box versions, allowing you to remove unwanted or outdated versions from the Vagrant Cloud repository.
