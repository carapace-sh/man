documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tsh request review` command is used in the Tenable Security Center platform to initiate a manual review of a vulnerability scan result or policy violation. When issued, it sends a notification to the assigned security analyst or team for further investigation and mitigation actions. This command facilitates collaborative efforts in maintaining the security posture of an organization.'
    flag:
        approve: '[AI] The `tsh request review --approve` command is a GitHub Tower (TSH) instruction used to approve a pull request. This command assumes that the TSH context is set up correctly with your GitHub access token and repository details. When executed, it indicates approval of the changes made in the pull request, enabling the merge of the changes into the target branch once more reviewers or automated checks have been completed.'
        deny: '[AI] The `tsh request review --deny` command is used in Tenable Security Center''s Ticketing System (TSH) to deny a pending security vulnerability remediation request. When this command is executed, the request will be denied and its status will be updated accordingly in the TSH database. This action should only be taken if the remediation is not currently possible or advisable based on organizational policies or other considerations. It''s important to note that denying a request does not automatically close the associated vulnerability scan finding, so additional steps may be required to manage the finding appropriately.'
        no-approve: '[AI] The `tsh request review --no-approve` command is used in GitLab''s Tower (TSH) CLI to initiate a review for a merge request without automatically approving it. This means that the person who runs this command will be prompted to confirm each individual change and can choose whether to approve or reject each one. Unlike `--approve` which automatically approves all changes, this command allows for more granular control during the merge request review process.'
        no-deny: '[AI] The `tsh request review --no-deny` command is a directive used in Traefik, a reverse proxy and load balancer for Docker environments. This command initiates the Traefik review process without denying any pending configuration changes. It allows administrators to inspect and approve or reject the proposed modifications before they are applied. The `--no-deny` flag ensures that no changes are automatically denied, providing a more flexible and manual approach to managing your Traefik configurations.'
        reason: '[AI] The `tsh request review --reason` command is used in GitLab''s Toolset for Shell (TSH) to submit a request for code review. The `--reason` option allows you to specify the reason or description of the changes made in your branch, which will be displayed to the reviewer when they access the merge request in GitLab. This helps ensure that the reviewers have a clear understanding of the purpose and scope of the changes before they begin their review.'
