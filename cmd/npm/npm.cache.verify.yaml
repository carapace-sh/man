documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm cache verify` command is used to check and repair any potential issues with your npm (Node Package Manager) cache. It scans all cached packages for integrity, and if it detects any corrupted files, it will attempt to redownload and replace them. This can help resolve issues with npm installations that may have been affected by network interruptions or other errors during the package download process. The command does not require any arguments and is run in your terminal or command prompt using `npm cache verify`.'
