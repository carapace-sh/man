        [AI] The `soft` command is not a standard command in Unix or Linux systems. It seems there might be some confusion as it could refer to various concepts with different meanings depending on the specific context, such as:

        1. In the context of mount options for file systems, "soft" can mean that a file system error will cause the mount to be remounted read-only instead of being unmounted.
        2. In some specific software applications, `soft` might refer to a particular mode or setting with a specific meaning.
        3. In machine learning, "soft" can refer to methods such as Softmax Regression or Soft Anding that deal with probabilities and gradual transitions.

        Without further context, it's impossible to give an accurate explanation of what the `soft` command means in your given situation.
    flag:
        help: '[AI] The `--help` option, when used with the `git` command followed by `soft`, is a request for displaying the usage information and available options for the specific Git subcommand named `git-soft-reset`. This will provide a brief explanation of what this command does and how it can be invoked with different arguments.'
        version: '[AI] The `--version` option when used with the `soft` command in Unix-based systems is utilized to display the version information of the Softlink Resolver (Soft) tool installed on the system. It provides details such as the Soft version number, build date, and other relevant information to help users identify the specific instance of the tool they are working with.'
