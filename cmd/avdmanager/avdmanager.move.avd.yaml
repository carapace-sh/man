    command: |-
        [AI] The `avdmanager move avd` command is used with the Android Studio's AVD (Android Virtual Device) Manager tool. This command moves or renames an existing AVD configuration file from one location to another within your system. It doesn't create a new AVD, but just changes the path where its config file is saved. For example, if you have an AVD named "MyAVD" located at `~/.android/avd/MyAVD.avd`, and you want to move it to a new directory `my_new_folder`, you would use:

        ```bash
        avdmanager move avd MyAVD my_new_folder
        ```

        This command will rename "MyAVD" to "my_new_folder/MyAVD.avd" while keeping the same configuration. Keep in mind that you need to provide the full path to the new folder when using this command.
    flag:
        name: '[AI] `avdmanager move avd --name` is a command used with the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager in Android Studio. This command moves an existing AVD (Android Virtual Device) identification name to another location in the list. By specifying the name of the AVD, you can easily reorder or relocate it within the list without having to create a new one.'
        path: '[AI] `avdmanager move avd --path` is a command used in Android Studio or other Android development tools to modify the path of an existing Android Virtual Device (AVD). The `avdmanager` is a command-line tool for managing multiple virtual devices and their associated configurations. The `move` option allows you to change the storage location of an existing AVD, while specifying the new path with the `--path` argument. This command helps in organizing your Android development environment by moving or relocating your AVDs as needed.'
        rename: '[AI] `avdmanager move avd --rename` is a command used in Android Studio or the Android SDK Platform-Tools to rename and move an existing AVD (Android Virtual Device) configuration. The `move` option specifies that both the name and the file path of the AVD should be changed, while the `--rename` flag is used to provide the new name for the AVD. This command updates the configuration files accordingly and creates a new directory with the new name and moves the related data files into it.'
