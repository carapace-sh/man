    command: '[AI] The `dbt source` command in dbt (Data Build Tool) is used to define and manage data sources, which are external databases or files that dbt will connect to and retrieve data from for further processing. This command allows users to configure connection settings, such as database type, username, password, and host, and also enables the creation of source keys to simplify referencing the data sources in dbt models. Overall, `dbt source` is an essential part of setting up and managing data pipelines with dbt.'
