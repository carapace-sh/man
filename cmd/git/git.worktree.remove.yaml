documentation:
    command: |-
        [AI] `git worktree remove` is a Git command used to delete a local checked-out branch or reference stored in a separate subdirectory using the Git worktree feature. The basic syntax for this command is:

        ```bash
        git worktree remove <path>
        ```

        Here, `<path>` represents the path to the subdirectory containing the checked-out worktree that you wish to delete. This command removes the worktree and its associated files, effectively detaching the branch from your local repository.
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `git worktree remove --force` is a Git command used to delete a existing worktree with the given name or location, forcefully overwriting any local changes or commits in that worktree. By default, Git will refuse to delete a worktree with uncommitted changes. Adding the `--force` option allows the deletion even if there are uncommitted changes or conflicts. It''s essential to be cautious when using this command, as it can result in the permanent loss of local changes and commits.'
