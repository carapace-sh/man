        [AI] `yarn set version` is a Yarn command used to set the version number of a specific project or package in a Yarn workspace. The `from` option specifies where to get the version number from, either from another project in the workspace, from a specific file (like a `package.json`), or from a specific tag or commit in a Git repository. For example:

        ```bash
        yarn set version my-project version.major=2.0.0 --from=packages./my-project/
        ```

        This command sets the major version of `my-project` to `2.0.0` using the current version in the `package.json` file of that project as the source.
