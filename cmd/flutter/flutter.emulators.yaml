documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `flutter emulators` command is used to manage Android and iOS simulators in the Flutter development environment. It allows you to create, start, stop, and list available simulators for testing your Flutter applications. The command interacts with the integrated Android Studio or Xcode emulator managers respectively.'
    flag:
        cold: '[AI] `flutter emulators --cold` is a command used in Flutter development to reset an Android or iOS emulator back to its initial state. When run, it shuts down the emulator if it''s currently running and then recreates it from scratch. This can be helpful when dealing with issues related to the emulator environment, such as corrupted cache or configuration problems. The `--cold` flag ensures a complete reset of the emulator.'
        create: '[AI] `flutter emulators --create` is a command used in Flutter development to create and manage Android or iOS emulators for testing and developing mobile applications. This command utilizes the Flutter Emulator tool, which is based on the Google Emulator Suite for Android (Android Studio) or Xcode for iOS. When you run `flutter emulators --create`, it will set up a new virtual device with predefined configurations, install an appropriate system image and emulator engine, and prepare it for use with your Flutter project. This enables developers to test their applications on various devices and Android/iOS versions without requiring physical devices.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `flutter emulators --help` command is used to display help information about the Flutter Emulator management tool. It allows users to create, manage, and launch Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) for testing and developing Flutter applications.

            The main functions of this command include:

            - Creating new AVD configurations
            - Listing existing AVDs
            - Starting an emulator session with a specified AVD
            - Updating the system image or tools for an AVD
            - Deleting an AVD configuration
            - Managing emulator properties like CPU, RAM, and screen size.

            By running `flutter emulators --help`, users can see the available subcommands, their usage, and detailed explanations to effectively manage their emulated environments for Flutter app development.
        launch: '[AI] `flutter emulators --launch` is a command used in Flutter development to launch an Android or iOS emulator from the Flutter Emulator Manager. When executed, it scans for available emulators and launches the first one found that matches the specified project configuration. This helps developers quickly test their apps without needing to set up physical devices.'
        name: '[AI] `flutter emulators --name` is a command used in Flutter development to create and manage virtual Android or iOS devices for testing and debugging purposes. The `--name` option allows you to specify a custom name for the emulator instance, facilitating easier identification among multiple running instances.'
