documentation:
    command: '[AI] `yarn init` is a command used in Yarn package manager to create a new `package.json` file. It prompts you to enter project details such as name, version, description, author information, license type, etc., which are then saved in the generated `package.json` file. This file keeps track of the project''s dependencies and scripts used for running various tasks. After running this command, you can install required dependencies using `yarn install`.'
    flag:
        install: '[AI] The command `yarn init --install` is used to initialize a new Yarn project and install its listed dependencies at once. When you run this command, Yarn creates a `package.json` file based on user input for various project metadata and prompts for specifying the dependencies, which are then installed immediately using `--install`. This is in contrast to running only `yarn init`, where dependencies would need to be manually installed separately using `yarn add`.'
        private: '[AI] The command `yarn init --private` is used to initialize a new Yarn (a package manager for JavaScript) project with a private package registry. This means that the packages used in the project will not be published to the public npm registry by default, but will instead be saved in a .yarn-integrity or .pmap file in your project directory. By using `--private`, you maintain control over which packages are installed and shared within your team or organization. This is particularly useful when working on internal projects where you want to keep certain dependencies confidential.'
        workspace: '[AI] `yarn init --workspace` is a command used with Yarn, a popular JavaScript package manager. This command initializes a new Yarn workspace. A workspace is a collection of packages that are related and share common dependencies. With the `--workspace` option, you create an empty workspace structure, allowing you to add multiple packages under one root directory, each having its own `package.json` file with independent installations and builds. This command sets up the basic files and directories for your new workspace, ready for adding and managing packages within it.'
