    command: '[AI] The `vagrant plugin repair` command is used to scan and fix any issues with installed Vagrant plugins in your local Vagrant environment. If a plugin becomes corrupted or encounters an error during installation, this command can help identify and resolve the problem by reinstalling the affected plugins. It scans for missing or damaged plugin files, downloads the latest versions of those plugins from the Vagrant plugin repository, and then restores any user-specific plugin configurations. This command is particularly useful when experiencing issues with plugins that prevent Vagrant from functioning properly.'
    flag:
        local: '[AI] The `vagrant plugin repair --local` command is a Vagrant (a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments) command used to repair local installed plugins that may be corrupted or have issues. When this command is run, Vagrant will scan the local plugin directory for any corrupted plugins and attempt to repair them by downloading and reinstalling their latest versions from the Vagrant plugin repository. This can help resolve problems with plugins that cause errors or prevent Vagrant from functioning correctly.'
