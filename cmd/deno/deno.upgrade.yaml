documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `deno upgrade` command is used to update Deno, a modern JavaScript runtime, to its latest stable version. It retrieves and installs the new release from the official Deno registry, ensuring that you have access to the latest features and bug fixes. To use it, simply open your terminal or command prompt and type `deno upgrade`. If Deno is installed and there is a newer version available, it will be automatically updated for you.'
    flag:
        canary: '[AI] `deno upgrade --canary` is a command used in Deno, a modern and secure TypeScript runtime. This command is used to install the latest development version (also known as the canary build) of Deno on your system. By running this command, you''ll get access to the newest features, improvements, and bug fixes before they are released in an official stable version. It''s important to note that using canary builds may come with some instability or compatibility issues that aren''t present in stable releases.'
        cert: '[AI] The `deno upgrade --cert` command is used in Deno, a modern and secure TypeScript runtime, to update or install new Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates for Deno''s built-in HTTP server. This command checks for updates to the TLS certificate bundles in the Deno registry and downloads and applies them if available, ensuring the use of up-to-date and secure certificates for HTTP communication.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `deno upgrade --dry-run` is a command used in Deno, a modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. This command simulates an upgrade to the latest Deno version without actually applying the changes. It allows users to check what files will be modified or updated before running the actual upgrade. This can help prevent unintended consequences and ensure smooth upgrades.'
        force: '[AI] `deno upgrade --force` is a command used in Deno, a modern and secure TypeScript runtime. This command is utilized to upgrade the Deno installation to the latest version forcefully. When you run `deno upgrade --force`, it checks for available updates and installs them without asking for user confirmation, making it a useful option when you want to ensure your Deno environment stays up-to-date with minimal interaction.'
        help: '[AI] The `deno upgrade --help` command is used to display help information about the Deno package manager''s `upgrade` sub-command. When run, it provides a detailed explanation of how to use the `upgrade` command to update Deno and its dependencies to the latest stable versions. It also lists any available options or flags that can be passed with the command for fine-grained control over the upgrade process.'
        output: '[AI] `deno upgrade --output` is a command used in Deno, a modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. This command facilitates the installation or update of Deno itself and its accompanying tools, such as `deno test`, `deno run`, and others. The `--output` flag modifies the output behavior of the command. Instead of printing messages to the console, it writes them into a file specified by the user. This can be useful for automating processes or analyzing output in detail.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `deno upgrade --quiet` command is used to update Deno, a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, to the latest stable version, without displaying any informational messages or progress bars during the installation process. This option is useful when running the command in automated scripts or continuous integration environments where silent updates are preferred.'
        unstable: '[AI] `deno upgrade --unstable` is a command used in Deno, a modern and secure TypeScript runtime. This command facilitates the installation of the latest development version (also known as "canary" or "nightly build") of Deno. Running this command will update your Deno installation to the next unstable release, which may include new features, bug fixes, or other improvements that have not yet been stabilized and released as a production-ready version. Keep in mind that using an unstable version could potentially introduce new issues or instability, so it''s recommended for users who want the latest features and are willing to accept potential risks.'
        version: '[AI] `deno upgrade --version` is a command used in Deno, a modern and secure TypeScript runtime. This command checks for available updates to Deno''s runtime and installs the latest stable version. It ensures that your Deno environment remains up-to-date with the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.'
