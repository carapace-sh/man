This specific command performs a check of Terraform configuration files against Terraform''s built-in rules and best practices. It does not make any modifications to the files but reports any potential issues or warnings that might exist in the configuration. It is typically used to validate Terraform configurations before applying changes to ensure optimal performance, security, and compatibility.'

            [AI] `terraform fmt --detailed-exit-code` is a command used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. The command is designed to reformat your Terraform configuration files (written in HCL language) to conform to Terraform's style guide.

            The `--detailed-exit-code` flag is an optional argument.
