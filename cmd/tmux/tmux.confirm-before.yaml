documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tmux confirm-before` is a configuration option in TMUX, the terminal multiplexer. It determines whether TMUX should ask for confirmation before performing destructive actions, such as deleting windows or sessions. When set to "on", TMUX will display a prompt asking for confirmation before executing these commands. This helps prevent accidental loss of data or sessions.'
    flag:
        p: '[AI] The `tmux` flag `confirm-before -p` is used to require confirmation before performing a session or window title change operation. This means that when attempting to rename a session or window, tmux will pause and wait for the user to enter a confirmatory yes or no input before proceeding with the change. The `-p` option makes tmux display a more explicit prompt message during this confirmation process.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux confirm-before -t` flag is a setting in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, that requires confirmation before detaching or renaming sessions with the `detach` and `rename` commands, respectively. This helps prevent accidental actions on running sessions, ensuring the user''s work environment remains stable and secure.'
