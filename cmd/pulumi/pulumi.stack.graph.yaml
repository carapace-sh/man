    command: '[AI] `pulumi stack graph` is a command provided by Pulumi, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, to visualize the dependency relationships between stacks in a Pulumi project. A stack represents a logical grouping of resources in Pulumi. This command generates a graphical representation showing how different stacks depend on each other, providing insight into the flow of resource dependencies within your Pulumi project.'
