description: wait for device to be in given state
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `adb wait-for-local-recovery` command is a part of Android Debug Bridge (ADB), which is a versatile tool for developers to communicate with an Android device. This specific command is used to wait for the Android system to enter the recovery mode locally on the device. In other words, it suspends further ADB commands execution until the device enters the recovery mode. Once in recovery mode, various advanced operations such as flashing custom recoveries or ROMs can be performed.'
