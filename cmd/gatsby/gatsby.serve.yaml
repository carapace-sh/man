documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gatsby serve` is a command provided by GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator built with React. It starts a local development server and builds your Gatsby site on demand when files change. The generated site is then served to the browser over HTTP at `http://localhost:8000`. This allows for real-time previewing of changes during development. Once you''re satisfied with your changes, you can deploy the generated site to a static hosting service like Netlify or GitHub Pages.'
    flag:
        host: '[AI] `gatsby serve --host` is a command used in GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator. This command starts a local development server for your Gatsby site and makes it accessible at the specified host (default is `localhost`) on a randomly assigned port number. By using `--host`, you can customize the hostname to access the site from other devices on the same network, which can be useful for testing and sharing the site with others during development.'
        open: |-
            [AI] `gatsby serve --open` is a command used in GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator. This command does the following:

            1. Builds your Gatsby site locally using `gatsby build`.
            2. Starts the development server with `gatsby serve`.
            3. Opens your built site in a new browser tab automatically for previewing changes.

            In simpler terms, it's an all-in-one command that builds, serves, and opens your Gatsby project locally for quick development iterations.
        open-tracing-config-file: '[AI] `gatsby serve --open-tracing-config-file` is a command used in GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator. This command starts a local development server and enables OpenTracing for distributed tracing. The `--open-tracing-config-file` option specifies the path to an OpenTracing configuration file. This file defines how to instrument the application and send traces to a specific tracing system such as Jaeger or Zipkin for performance monitoring and analysis.'
        port: '[AI] `gatsby serve --port` is a command used in GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator. This command starts a local development server for your Gatsby site with custom port number specified by `--port`. The server automatically builds your site and begins serving it at the default URL `http://localhost:8000`, or the specified port if provided. It also provides features like live reloading of changes, enabling you to see updates in real-time during development.'
        prefix-paths: '[AI] `gatsby serve --prefix-paths` is a command used in GatsbyJS, a popular static site generator. This command starts a local development server for your Gatsby site and enables serving of assets from custom paths besides the default ones. The `--prefix-paths` option allows you to specify a JSON object with custom prefixes for different types of files or directories, which will be served at the specified path when accessed through the browser. This is useful for handling subrouting or serving static assets from non-default locations within your Gatsby project.'
