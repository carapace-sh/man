documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux attach-session` command is used in the Unix terminal multiplexer `tmux` to reattach a detached session. When you start a tmux session and then detach from it using the `detach` or `Ctrl+B D` key combination, your session continues running in the background. With `attach-session`, you can later reconnect to that session by providing its ID or name as an argument. For example: `tmux attach-session -t <session-name>`. This command brings the session to the front of your terminal window and allows you to interact with it again.'
    flag:
        E: '[AI] `tmux attach-session` is a command used in the tmux terminal multiplexer to reattach a previously detached terminal session. The `-E` option (or `--slave-env`) sets or merges environment variables from the parent terminal into the attached session. This can be useful when the parent terminal has environment variables that should be available in the session, such as when using tools like Docker or Vagrant. The overall command `tmux attach-session -E <session-id>` reattaches the specified session and merges its environment variables with those of the parent terminal.'
        c: '[AI] `tmux attach-session` is a command used in the tmux terminal multiplexer to reattach a previously detached terminal session. The `-c` option specifies which session to attach to by defaulting to the named session if it exists, or attaching to the most recent session if no name is given. For example, `tmux attach-session -c mysession` would attach to a session named "mysession". If "mysession" does not exist, it will attach to the last session created.'
        d: '[AI] `tmux attach-session` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to reattach a detached session. The `-d` option runs the attached session in detached mode after attaching it, meaning it will run in the background and return control back to the terminal once the attachment process is complete. Therefore, using `tmux attach-session -d <session-id>` will reattach the specified session in the background.'
        f: '[AI] `tmux attach-session` is a command in the tmux terminal multiplexer that allows you to reattach a previously detached terminal session. The `-f` option, when used with this command, forces tmux to attach to the named session, even if it''s not currently running. This can be useful when dealing with sessions that might have been detached unexpectedly or if you want to ensure that you''re connecting to a specific session. In summary, `tmux attach-session -f` will attach to an existing terminal session forcefully.'
        r: '[AI] `tmux attach-session -r` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to reattach to an existing session. The `-r` option tells Tmux to attempt attaching to the most recent session that matches the given name or ID, instead of creating a new one. This is useful when you have multiple sessions running and want to quickly switch between them. When executed, Tmux will bring the selected session back to the front and detach the current terminal session, allowing you to continue working on it later from another terminal window.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux attach-session` is a command used in the tmux terminal multiplexer to reattach a previously detached terminal session. The `-t` option specifies the name or ID of the session to attach. For example, `tmux attach-session -t mysession` would reattach the session named "mysession". This allows users to continue their running applications and terminal processes in the same environment across multiple terminal windows or sessions.'
        x: '[AI] The `tmux attach-session` command with the `-x` option is used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to reattach a previously detached terminal session from the terminal multiplexer server, identified by its session ID, which can be found using the `tmux list-sessions` command. The `-x` flag indicates that Tmux should exit as soon as it finds an attached session with the given name or ID. If no such session exists, Tmux will return an error. This command is useful when you want to quickly resume a detached session without having to remember its exact ID or name.'
