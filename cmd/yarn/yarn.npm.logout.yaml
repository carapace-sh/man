        [AI] The command `yarn npm logout` is not a valid command. It appears to be a combination of two different package managers, Yarn and NPM (Node Package Manager), with an incorrect usage of the NPM command "logout".

        Yarn is a popular JavaScript package manager, while NPM is the default package manager for Node.js. Neither of these commands is used for logging out from any specific platform or service, as they are intended for managing project dependencies and running scripts. If you meant to run a different command or need assistance with a particular task, please provide more context or consult the documentation of your chosen package manager.
    flag:
        all: '[AI] The command `yarn npm logout --all` is used to log out from all authenticated NPM (Node Package Manager) registries associated with your current Yarn or npm configuration. This action revokes access tokens, allowing you to manage new ones if needed. It''s particularly helpful when you need to switch accounts or when you suspect unauthorized usage of your account.'
        publish: '[AI] The command `yarn npm logout --publish` is used to log out from an NPM (Node Package Manager) account associated with a Yarn workspace and simultaneously publish packages that are linked to the account. When you run this command, you will be prompted to enter your email address and password for the NPM account. Once authenticated, all packages specified in the `publishConfig` field in the `package.json` files within your Yarn workspace will be published under the logged-out account. This command is particularly useful when transitioning between development environments or collaborating on projects with multiple developers who each need to publish their own packages.'
        scope: '[AI] The command `yarn npm logout --scope` is used to log out from an NPM registry for a specific scope in Yarn package manager. When you authenticate with NPM using `npm login`, you can create scoped packages under your username. The `--scope` option specifies the package scope during registration. To log out from a particular scope, use this command. This will revoke access tokens for that specific scope and sign you out of the registry.'
