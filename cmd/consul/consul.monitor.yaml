documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul monitor` command is used in Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. It allows users to register an application or service with Consul, and then monitors its health and availability. If the registered service goes down or becomes unhealthy, Consul can automatically reroute traffic to other healthy services, ensuring high availability and resilience of applications in a distributed environment.'
    flag:
        ca-file: |-
            [AI] `consul monitor --ca-file` is a command used with Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. The `monitor` flag tells Consul to run in monitoring mode, continuously checking the health of services and configurations.

            The `--ca-file` option specifies the path to a file containing the root Certificate Authority (CA) certificates that should be trusted when communicating with Secure Transport Layer (TLS)-enabled services or clients. This is necessary in secure environments where only trusted entities are allowed to communicate.
        ca-path: '[AI] `consul monitor` is a command-line tool for Consul, an open-source distributed computing platform that provides service discovery, configuration, and orchestration capabilities. The `--ca-path` option is used to specify the location of a custom CA (Certificate Authority) bundle file for SSL certificates in consul''s client-side TLS communication. This ensures secure communication between the Consul agent and the Consul server by verifying the identity of the server with a trusted certificate.'
        client-cert: '[AI] The `--client-cert` flag in Consul''s `monitor` command is used to specify a client certificate file when making API requests to the Consul server. This flag ensures secure communication between the monitoring client and Consul server by using Transport Layer Security (TLS). The provided certificate file should be valid and properly configured for the client''s private key, ensuring mutual authentication between the client and server in the Consul ecosystem.'
        client-key: '[AI] `consul monitor` is a command provided by Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. The `--client-key` flag is used to specify a client token for authentication when performing monitoring tasks. This ensures that only authorized clients can interact with the Consul API, enhancing security in multi-tenant environments or setups where access control is important.'
        http-addr: '[AI] The `--http-addr` flag in Consul''s Monitoring command (`consul monitor`) is used to specify the HTTP address where Consul should listen for incoming monitoring data. By default, Consul listens on a local interface, but using this flag allows you to set a custom IP address or hostname and port number to bind to, enabling remote agents to send monitoring data to Consul over HTTP.'
        log-json: '[AI] `consul monitor` is a command-line tool for Consul, an open-source distributed computing platform. The `--log-json` flag instructs Consul to output logs in JSON format when monitoring services or health checks. This option enables easier log parsing and analysis by tools like ELK Stack or Logstash that are designed to handle JSON data.'
        log-level: |-
            [AI] The `consul monitor` is a command-line tool used in the Consul service discovery and configuration management platform. The `--log-level` option sets the log level for the output of the monitoring function.

            Here are the possible log levels, from most verbose to least:

            1. `trace`: Logs every single event, including internal details.
            2. `debug`: Logs detailed information about the state and progress of requests and other events.
            3. `info`: Logs important events and application status messages. This is usually the default log level.
            4. `warning`: Logs warnings that indicate an issue, but do not prevent normal operation.
            5. `error`: Logs critical errors that may indicate a failure of some kind.
            6. `critical`: Logs very severe errors or failures that warrant immediate attention.
            7. `panic`: Logs and stops the application due to a run-time panic error.

            Using the `--log-level` option, you can control the level of detail in the monitoring output, which can help with troubleshooting and understanding the state of your applications.
        tls-server-name: '[AI] The `--tls-server-name` flag is used with Consul''s Monitoring feature when setting up TLS (Transport Layer Security) for communication between the monitoring agent and the Consul server. This flag specifies the hostname or IP address that should be presented to the client as the server name during the TLS handshake. By providing this information, you ensure secure and encrypted communication between the two parties by requiring a valid SSL certificate with the specified name.'
        token: '[AI] `consul monitor` is a command-line tool for Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management platform. The `--token` option is used to provide an ACL (Access Control List) token for authenticating the command. This token grants specific permissions in Consul, such as reading or writing data, depending on its associated policy. Using this flag ensures secure access to Consul''s functionality while maintaining fine-grained control over who can perform actions within the platform.'
        token-file: '[AI] The `consul monitor` is a command-line tool used in Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management platform. The `--token-file` flag is an option provided to this command, which specifies the path to a file containing an access token for authentication. When this flag is used, the Consul CLI tools will read the token from the file instead of requiring it to be provided as an argument on the command line. This adds an extra layer of security by not exposing sensitive tokens in clear text during the execution of commands.'
