documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker image push` is a Docker command used to upload an image from a local machine to a Docker registry. It takes one required argument, which is the name and optionally a tag or a digest of the image to be pushed, followed by the registry address and optional authentication details (if the registry requires authentication). For example: `docker image push myimage:latest myregistry:5000/myimage:latest`. The command authenticates and establishes a connection with the registry, then sends the image data in chunks for efficient transfer. Once completed, the image is available to be pulled from the registry by other systems.'
    flag:
        all-tags: '[AI] `docker image push --all-tags` is a command used in Docker to push all existing tags of an image to a registry. When you build an image and tag it with multiple versions (for example, `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.), you can use this command to push all these tags to a Docker registry with just one command call. The registry can then store and manage the different versions of the image for you, enabling easy rollbacks or updates.'
        disable-content-trust: '[AI] The `docker image push --disable-content-trust` command is used to push a Docker image to a registry without verifying the image''s content signature. This option disables the content trust feature, which by default ensures that only trusted images are pulled or pushed. When you use this flag, you bypass the security check and allow the unverified image to be pushed. It can be useful in specific scenarios where you have control over the registry and trust the source of the image but it may introduce potential security risks if used carelessly.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `docker image push --quiet` command is used to push a Docker image to a registry without displaying any progress output or messages during the transfer. This can be useful when automating tasks or running scripts in non-interactive environments where you only want to see the success or failure of the push operation. The `--quiet` flag suppresses all output other than error messages, creating a more silent operation.'
