        [AI] `kubeadm join` is a command used to join worker nodes to an existing Kubernetes cluster managed by `kubeadm` on a control plane node. The `phase control-plane-join` argument refers to the specific phase of the `kubeadm join` process that is being controlled.

        This command initiates the control-plane components installation on the worker node, making it able to manage and coordinate cluster activities. It involves downloading the required certificates and configuring the kubelet and other necessary components for a control-plane node.

        In summary, `kubeadm join phase control-plane-join` is used to install control plane components on a worker node and make it a part of the Kubernetes cluster as a control-plane node.
