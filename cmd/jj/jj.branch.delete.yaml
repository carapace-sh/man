        [AI] The `jj` command is not a standard Git command. If you meant to use the `git` command with the similar-looking syntax, then the command `git branch delete <branch_name>` deletes a local or remote Git branch.

        When used with a local branch, this command will permanently delete the specified branch if it has been merged into the current branch and there are no remaining checks out or tracking references to that branch locally. If the branch has unmerged changes, you'll need to switch to that branch first using `git checkout <branch_name>` before deleting it.

        When used with a remote branch, this command will delete the specified branch from the current repository only if you have the necessary permissions (usually being the branch creator or having administrative access). This will not remove the branch from other repositories or systems where it may exist.

        help: '[AI] The `jj branch delete` command is a Git extension tool provided by Jira Software Data Center and Cloud to manage Git branches from within Jira. This specific command is used to delete a Git branch. The `--help` option is used to display detailed help information about the command, including its usage, options, and examples. So, running `jj branch delete --help` will show you how to delete a Git branch using this command, including any required arguments or flags, and other relevant details.'
