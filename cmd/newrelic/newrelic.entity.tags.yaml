        [AI] The `newrelic entity tags` command is not a standard New Relic or any other known command. New Relic is a software analytics company that provides monitoring solutions for web applications and infrastructure. "Entity" in the New Relic context refers to different types of monitored objects, like APM applications, browser sessions, or infrastructure instances.

        The term "tags" in this context are metadata labels that can be assigned to entities for better organization and filtering within the New Relic interface. The command itself would typically not be used directly but rather managed through the New Relic UI or API. To add tags to an entity, follow these general steps:

        1. Log into your New Relic account.
        2. Navigate to the desired application, browser session, or infrastructure instance in the New Relic UI.
        3. Click on the 'Settings' or 'Details' tab and find the 'Tags' section.
        4. Enter a tag name and save it. To remove tags, simply delete them from this section.
        5. Use the New Relic search functionality to filter entities based on their tags.
