documentation:
    command: '[AI] `adb shell` is a command used in Android development to open a shell session on an Android device connected via Android Debug Bridge (ADB). It allows users to execute commands directly on the device''s operating system, providing access to advanced functionalities such as file manipulation, running scripts, and installing applications from the command line.'
    flag:
        T: '[AI] The `adb shell` command is used to open a terminal session on an Android device connected to a computer via USB. The option `-T` that follows it, `adb shell -T`, sets the remote terminal type to "ansi", enabling better display of text colors and other ANSI escape sequences in the output. This can be useful for debugging or running scripts that produce colored output on the Android device.'
        e: '[AI] `adb shell -e` is a command used in Android development to open an interactive shell session on an Android device connected via USB with Android Debug Bridge (ADB). The `-e` option enables "application mode" which runs the shell as if it was an application, allowing to start activities and execute intent receivers. This can be useful for debugging or testing specific use cases, such as starting a particular activity or injecting input into an app''s UI.'
        "n": '[AI] `adb shell` is a command used in Android Development to open a terminal session on an Android device connected to your computer. The option `-n <serialno>` specifies the serial number of the device to target, ensuring that the correct device is selected when there are multiple devices connected. So, `adb shell -n <serialno>` opens a terminal session on the specifically targeted Android device with the given serial number.'
        t: '[AI] `adb shell -t` is a command used in Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to start an interactive shell session with a connected Android device. The `-t` option stands for "text" and requests that the shell output be in text format, rather than binary or other types. This command allows you to run various Linux commands on the Android device''s operating system to perform tasks such as file manipulation, installing apps, and debugging.'
        x: '[AI] `adb shell` is a command used in Android development to open a terminal session on an Android device connected to the computer. The `-x` option is passed with this command to allow running commands that require elevated permissions, also known as superuser or root access. So, `adb shell -x` grants temporary root access to execute specific commands on the connected Android device.'
