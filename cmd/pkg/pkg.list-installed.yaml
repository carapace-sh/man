documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pkg list-installed` command is used in the pkg package manager of FreeBSD to display a list of all the packages that are currently installed on the system. It does not require any arguments and simply outputs the names and versions of the installed packages, typically in a tabular format for easy reading. The output can be redirected to a file or piped into other commands for further processing if desired.'
