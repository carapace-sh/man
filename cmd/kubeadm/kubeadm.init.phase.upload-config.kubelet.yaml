description: Upload the kubelet component config to a ConfigMap
flags:
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubeconfig=: The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster. If the flag is not set, a set of standard locations can be searched for an existing kubeconfig file.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm init` command is used to bootstrap a new Kubernetes cluster. The specific subcommand `phase upload-config kubelet` triggers the uploading of the Kubernetes kubelet configuration file to the etcd server in the cluster. This configuration file allows the kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, to communicate with the cluster''s control plane components. Upon successful upload, the nodes in the cluster will be able to join and register with the new cluster.'
    flag:
        config: |-
            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool for setting up a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm, the open-source project managing Kubernetes clusters. The `phase upload-config kubelet --config` argument is used during the initialization process to configure the node as part of the Kubernetes cluster.

            More specifically, this command uploads the kubelet configuration file to the etcd server, which is a key-value store used for storing the cluster's metadata. The kubelet is a system component responsible for maintaining the container runtime environment and enforcing the Kubernetes cluster's policies. By uploading its configuration file to etcd, the node can be joined to the cluster and managed by the Kubernetes control plane.

            In summary, `kubeadm init phase upload-config kubelet --config` is a step in the initialization process for adding a new node to a Kubernetes cluster. It configures the kubelet on the node by uploading its configuration file to the etcd server, enabling management by the control plane and full participation in the cluster.
        kubeconfig: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The specific subcommand `phase upload-config kubelet --kubeconfig` instructs it to upload the configuration for the Kubelet component to the currently active kubeconfig file. In simpler terms, this command tells Kubeadm to add the necessary information about the Kubelet to the main configuration file so that the Kubelets in the cluster can communicate with the Kubernetes control plane.'
