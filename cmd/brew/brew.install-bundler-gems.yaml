    command: '[AI] `brew install-bundler-gems` is not a valid Homebrew (or MacOS) command. The closest command in Homebrew that relates to Ruby''s Bundler and managing gems would be `brew install bundler`, which installs the Bundler gem manager for Ruby projects. If you want to install specific gems using Bundler, use `bundle install` or `bundle add <gem_name>` in your project directory.'

        add-groups: '[AI] `brew install-bundler-gems` is a command used with Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. This specific command installs Bundler and its associated gems (libraries) in Ruby using Homebrew. The `--add-groups` option is used to install the required groups of dependencies in one go, ensuring that all necessary gems are installed alongside Bundler. In essence, it sets up a complete Ruby on Rails development environment with a single command.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew install-bundler-gems --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to install Bundler and its associated gems (libraries) with debugging enabled. The `--debug` flag turns on detailed output during the installation process, which can help diagnose any issues that may arise. This command assumes that Bundler is not yet installed or up-to-date in your Homebrew environment.'
        groups: '[AI] `brew install-bundler-gems` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command installs Bundler and its listed gems in one go. The `--groups` option specifies the groups of gems to be installed, allowing you to select specific sets of gems based on their functional categories. For instance, you might use `--groups production development test` to install gems for development, production, and testing environments simultaneously.'
        help: |-
