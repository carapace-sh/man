description: Generate the certificate for the front proxy client
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save and store the certificates.
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubernetes-version=: Choose a specific Kubernetes version for the control plane.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command used to bootstrap a new Kubernetes cluster. The specific subcommand `phase certs front-proxy-client` generates and configures client certificate and key for the FrontProxyClient, which is an identity used by the Kubernetes proxy component to make requests to the Kubernetes API server securely. This command should be executed on the node where you want to install the Kubernetes control plane components.'

            [AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase certs front-proxy-client --cert-dir` option specifies the phase for generating client certificates for the FrontProxyClient.

            In a Kubernetes cluster, the FrontProxyClient is an internal Kubernetes service account that acts as a reverse proxy between external clients and the cluster's API server. The `--cert-dir` flag indicates the directory where the generated client certificate files will be saved. These certificates are used to secure communication between external clients and the FrontProxyClient, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between them.
        config: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase certs front-proxy-client --config` subcommand generates and configures SSL certificates for the front-proxy client in the Kubernetes control plane. This is an optional step during initialization, and it''s used when setting up an external load balancer or proxy server to access the cluster. The generated certificates will be saved in a specified directory as defined by the `--config` flag.'
        kubernetes-version: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line utility used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The `phase certs front-proxy-client` subcommand is used during the initialization process to generate TLS certificates for the front-proxy client in the Kubernetes cluster. The `--kubernetes-version` flag specifies which version of Kubernetes should be used when generating these certificates. These certificates are essential for secure communication between the Kubernetes control plane and front-proxy clients, such as MetaBase or Nginx, that act as proxies to allow external access to the cluster services.'
