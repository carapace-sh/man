    command: '[AI] The `tofu get` command is a part of Tofu, a Git-based data versioning system. It retrieves specific versions of files or directories from a Tofu repository based on their unique IDs or tags. The command takes the ID or tag as its argument and returns the corresponding file content or directory structure.'
    flag:
        no-color: '[AI] The `tofu` command in Git is used to show the differences between two commits or tree objects in a way that hides the diff statistics and commit messages, leaving only the changed lines highlighted as contextless blocks of text called "tofu" or "text object file format". The option `--no-color` disables color output when running this command.'
        update: |-
            [AI] The command `tofu get --update` is used in Tofu, a tool for managing dependencies and updating packages in Haskell projects. This specific command does the following:

            1. It fetches the latest versions of all specified dependencies listed in the project's cabal file or .package file.
            2. If any new version is available, it downloads the package sources and computes their checksums for verification.
            3. It updates the local package database with the new packages if their checksums match.
            4. Finally, it saves the updated package information into the project's cabal file or .package file.
