documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `brew dr` command is not a valid command in Homebrew, which is a popular package manager for macOS.

If you meant to run `brew clean --force`, that command removes all caches and downloads, freeing up disk space in the Homebrew installation directory.'
    flag:
        audit-debug: '[AI] The `brew audit --debug` command is a diagnostic tool provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux. This command runs an audit check on all installed packages in the Homebrew system, generating detailed debug information about each installation to help identify potential issues or vulnerabilities. It''s often used by system administrators, developers, or security professionals to ensure the integrity and security of their software installations.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew dr --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `dr` (delete-revisions) subcommand is used to remove old revisions of previously installed Homebrew packages from the Homebrew Cellar. The `--debug` flag enables detailed debugging information to be printed during the execution of this command, which can help in troubleshooting any potential issues.'
        help: '[AI] The `brew dr --help` command is used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to display help information about the `reinstall` or `delete-revisions` subcommand. This command allows users to force-reinstall specific packages and their dependencies from scratch, or delete old revisions of installed packages. The `--help` flag provides a detailed explanation of how to use this subcommand with various options.'
        list-checks: '[AI] `brew dr --list-checks` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command generates a list of outdated checks for installed formulae (Homebrew packages), which can be used to update them to their latest versions or remove unused ones. It does not actually perform any updates or removals; it simply provides the information needed for these actions.'
        quiet: '[AI] The command `brew dr --quiet` is a terminal command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `dr` (delete-revisions) subcommand is used to remove outdated revisions of installed Homebrew packages from the system.

In summary, this command deletes old package revisions quietly.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `brew drain --verbose` command is used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command helps to clean up the cellar directory by deleting unused and outdated versions of installed packages.
