        [AI] The `brew homepage` command is not a valid command for Homebrew, which is a popular package manager for macOS. Instead, to visit the Homebrew project's website in your web browser, use the following terminal command:

        ```
        open https://brew.sh
        ```

        Or, if you prefer using wget or curl for downloading content, you can use these commands instead:

        ```bash
        wget -qO- https://brew.sh | bash
        # or
        curl -sL https://brew.sh | bash
        ```

        These commands will take you to the Homebrew project's website and display it in your terminal, but they don't actually have any effect on your system installation of Homebrew itself.
    flag:
        cask: '[AI] `brew homepage --cask` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command opens the Homebrew Cask page in a web browser. Homebrew Cask enables installing and managing binaries and apps (as opposed to system packages or libraries) via Homebrew. It simplifies the installation process by handling downloads and installations in one step, making it easier to manage third-party software on macOS systems using Homebrew.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew homepage --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command displays detailed debug information when Homebrew fetches and updates its homepage from GitHub. It''s often used by developers to troubleshoot issues or gain insight into Homebrew''s behind-the-scenes operations.'
        formula: '[AI] `brew homepage --formula` is a command used in Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. The command retrieves information about a specific Homebrew formula from Homebrew''s repository on GitHub. A formula is a recipe that describes how to build, install, and manage software packages using Homebrew. By providing the name of the desired formula as an argument, this command allows users to quickly access detailed information about the software it manages.'
        help: '[AI] The `brew homepage --help` command is not a valid Homebrew (MacOS package manager) command. Homebrew does have a `help` command, but it doesn''t take a sub-command like `homepage`. Instead, you can use `brew help` to get a list of available commands and brief explanations, or `brew help [command]` for detailed help on a specific command. If you meant to display Homebrew''s website in a web browser, try using `open https://brew.sh` instead.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `brew homepage --quiet` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is designed to display the URL of the Homebrew repository in a quiet or minimalistic way, without any additional output or messages. It is often used when automating tasks or scripts that only require the repository URL.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew homepage --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command displays detailed information about Homebrew''s official website (or repository) when querying for it. The "--verbose" flag intensifies the output to include more details such as HTTPS certificate information and response codes, providing additional debugging information for advanced users or troubleshooting purposes.'
