documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `dart pub cache clean` command is used to clear the Dart package cache. It deletes all files in the local Dart package cache directory, located by default at `~/.pub-cache/`, so that you can download fresh copies of packages when using `pub get`. This can be helpful if there are issues with the currently cached packages or if you want to ensure that you have the latest versions.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The `dart pub cache clean --force` command is used to clear the Dart package cache with force. This means that all cached packages and their locked files will be deleted without any confirmation prompts, allowing for a fresh start when dealing with dependency conflicts or other issues related to the Dart package manager (pub).'
        help: |-
            [AI] `dart pub cache clean` is a command provided by Dart's pub tool for managing packages in Dart projects. The `--help` option, when used with this command, displays detailed information about how to use it. Here's what the help output explains:

            - This command clears the local package cache created by `dart get`. It removes all downloaded packages and their lock files.
            - Running `pub cache clean` without any arguments will delete all cached packages. If you want to clear specific caches, provide a list of package names instead. For example, use `--path <path>` with the name of a directory to clear only that cache.
            - By default, this command only deletes files from the local system cache; it doesn't affect any remote or global caches.
            - Use `pub global run <script>` instead of `dart run` when you want to ensure your project has the latest dependencies before running a script. If you still need to manually clear your cache, use this command as described above.
