documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea times add` command is used in Teatime, a calendar application, to create a new tea time event. This command takes input as arguments such as date, start and end time, and description of the event to be added to the calendar. It then adds the new event to the Teatime database and displays a confirmation message.'
    flag:
        login: '[AI] `tee times add --login` is a command used with the `tee` utility in Unix-like operating systems. This command creates a new file or appends data to an existing one, and then displays that data on the terminal in real time. The `--login` option is specific to the `add` subcommand and it''s used when you want to append data to a file that has file permission settings for logging in (i.e., files under `/var/log/` or similar locations). This ensures that the new data is written to the file with appropriate access permissions.'
        remote: |-
            [AI] The `--remote` option in the `tea times` command is used to specify a Git remote repository URL, allowing you to fetch or push changes from or to that repository. For example:

            ```bash
            tea times add --remote origin <url_to_your_remote_repository>
            ```

            This command adds a new remote named "origin" in your local Git repository and sets the URL to the specified Git repository address. You can then use commands like `git fetch origin` or `git push origin master` to interact with that remote repository.
        repo: '[AI] The command `tea times add --repo` is used in Teatime, a tool for managing Git repositories, to add a new repository to the Teatime collection. The `--repo` flag specifies the path to the Git repository directory that should be added. When run, Teatime will register this repository and enable easy access to it through its command-line interface for common Git operations.'
