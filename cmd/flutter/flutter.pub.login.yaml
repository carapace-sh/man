    command: '[AI] `flutter pub login` is a command used in Flutter development to authenticate with the Flutter Package Registry, allowing you to publish packages or manage dependencies with `flutter pub`. After running this command in your terminal and providing your Google account credentials when prompted, your Flutter project will be connected to the registry, enabling you to interact with it for publishing and managing packages.'

        help: |-
            [AI] `flutter pub login` is a command used in Flutter development for managing authentication with the Flutter package registry, Pub. The `--help` option is provided to display detailed help and usage information for this command. Here's what you can expect:

            Usage: `flutter pub login [<options>]`

            This command logs you into the Flutter package registry using your GitHub account or a token. If you're already logged in, it will just confirm your current authentication status.

            Options (with their short forms):

            1. `--no-interactive`: Skips any interactive prompts and accepts the default option whenever possible.
            2. `--quiet`: Suppresses most output, only printing success or error messages.
            3. `--token <token>`: Logs in using a personal access token instead of linking to a GitHub account.

            Help (full command with options):
            ```
            flutter pub login [options]
