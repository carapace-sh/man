        login: '[AI] The command `tea times delete --login` is related to the Teaspoon CLI (Command Line Interface) tool used in the Teaspoon testing framework for Ruby projects. This command is used to delete a specific login (authentication) record associated with a test suite or project within Teaspoon. By running this command with the `--login` flag, you''re instructing Teaspoon to target the removal of the login data, making it essential if you want to remove and set up new authentication for testing purposes.'
        remote: '[AI] `tea times delete --remote` is a command used in version control systems like Git. This command deletes local branches or commits that have already been pushed to the remote repository, effectively removing them from both the local and remote repositories. It''s often used when you want to ensure that your local changes are not conflicting with the latest changes on the remote branch, allowing for a clean slate before merging new changes.'
        repo: '[AI] `tea times delete --repo` is a command used in the Tea Time Git toolkit for managing Git repositories. It deletes an existing Git repository with the specified name. The `--repo` flag indicates that only the repository and not the working directory or any branches should be deleted. This command can help simplify Git repository management by allowing users to easily delete unused or unwanted repositories.'
