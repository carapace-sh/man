    command: '[AI] `tmux send-keys` is a TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) command used to send keyboard input to an active pane or window in a tmux session. The basic syntax is: `tmux send-keys <window_or_pane> <keyboard_input>`. For instance, to send the key combination "Ctrl + A" followed by "C" (creating a new window), use: `tmux send-keys C0-a c`. This command enables remote or local manipulation of a tmux session without needing to physically be at the terminal.'
    flag:
        F: '[AI] `tmux send-keys -F` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. It allows sending key sequences or entire keys as input to an active pane or window within the tmux session. The `-F` flag indicates that the input should be treated as a single Unicode character rather than multiple keys, making it useful for sending special characters or keyboard shortcuts directly.'
        H: '[AI] `tmux send-keys -H` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that allows sending keyboard input to a pane or window as if it was physically typed there. The `-H` flag stands for "send-to-pane-front". It means that the keys will be sent to the frontmost pane in the current window. This command can be used to send keys remotely over SSH sessions, automate tasks, or manipulate processes running inside Tmux without switching focus to them.'
        M: '[AI] `tmux send-keys -M` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer for sending keyboard keys as if they were typed directly into a Tmux pane or window. The `-M` flag stands for "send-mode," which means that special keys, such as Meta (usually represented by the `Alt` key) or Super (represented by the `Ctrl+Win` or `Ctrl+Cmd` keys), are interpreted and sent as their actual keys instead of sending an escape character followed by the key code. This command is useful for automating tasks, such as sending a specific sequence of keys to a remote server or another Tmux pane.'
        "N": '[AI] `tmux send-keys` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to send keystrokes or mouse events to an active window or pane. The `-N` option stands for "no-bell" and is used to suppress the bell character that might be generated by the command being sent, preventing any unwanted audible notifications. For instance, if you want to silently send a sequence of keys like Ctrl+C without triggering any bells, use `send-keys -t target-pane -N Ctrl-C`.'
        R: '[AI] `tmux send-keys -R` is a command in TMUX, the terminal multiplexer, used to send key sequences or entire scripts as input to the selected window pane or process within it. The `-R` flag signifies sending input to the selected remote session instead of the local one. This can be particularly useful when managing multiple sessions remotely and wanting to send commands or keystrokes to a specific process running there.'
        X: '[AI] `tmux send-keys -X` is a command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, used to send keystrokes or keyboard shortcuts over a SSH connection to remotely manipulate local terminal sessions. The `-X` flag enables sending the keys as if they were pressed on the local keyboard, bypassing the normal input processing done by the TMUX server. This allows for sending complex sequences of keys, such as Ctrl+A then d for detaching a session, or scripting automation of tmux sessions.'
        l: '[AI] `tmux send-keys -l` is a command in TMUX, a terminal multiplexer, used to send keyboard input to an active pane or window. The `-l` (lowercase L) flag stands for "local mode," which means the keys are sent directly to the target window without going through the local or system keyboard shortcut interception. This command can be useful when trying to send specific keys or sequences that may be intercepted by TMUX or your operating system.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux send-keys` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. The `-t` option specifies the target window or pane to which the keys will be sent. For example, `tmux send-keys -t <window-or-pane-id> "<keycombination>"` sends the specified key combination to the selected window or pane. This can be useful for sending keystrokes to remote servers or background processes without interrupting the current terminal session.'
