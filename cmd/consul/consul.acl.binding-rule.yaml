    command: |-
        [AI] The `consul acl binding-rule` command is used in Hashicorp's Consul service to manage Access Control List (ACL) rules for securing access to different resources in Consul. It allows you to create, update, or delete binding rules that define which ACL policies can grant access to specific resources.

        In essence, it helps you configure who (identified by an ACL policy name) has access to what (a resource identified by a path) within the Consul service. By using this command, you can create fine-grained access control rules that help secure your Consul infrastructure.
