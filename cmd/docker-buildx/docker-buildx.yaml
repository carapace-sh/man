    command: '[AI] `docker buildx` is a component of Docker Engine, introduced in version 20.10. It extends the core Docker CLI with additional capabilities for building and distributing multi-stage images using multiple buildx contexts (build nodes). These contexts can be local or remote (using Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, Azure ACR, Google Container Registry, etc.) and help achieve parallel builds, faster image building, and improved security by reducing the need to push intermediate images. You can create, manage, and delete buildx contexts with `docker buildx create`, `docker buildx inspect`, `docker buildx rm` commands.'

            [AI] `docker buildx` is a Docker extension that enables building multi-context projects using multiple buildx workers. The `--help` flag when used with `docker buildx` displays detailed help information about the command, its usage, and available options. Here's a brief summary of what you can find in the help output:

            - `docker buildx [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARG...]`: Builds Docker images using multiple contexts (build environments) and workers.
            - `--add | --no-add`: Adds the built images to the default registry after building (default: `true`).
            - `--build-arg <arg>[=<value>]:`: Passes a build-time variable to the build process.
            - `--context <name> [<path | dockerref>]:`: Sets or uses a specific context for building images.
            - `--filter <filter>:`: Applies filters during image building (e.g., remove unused layers, cache, etc.).
            - `--progress <progressdriver>:`: Specifies the progress driver for displaying build progress.
            - `--shm-size <size>:`: Sets the size of shared memory used by Docker containers and build workers.
            - `--verbosity [FLAG]:`: Controls the level of verbosity during building (e.g., --verbose, --debug).
            - `--workdir <path>:`: Sets the working directory for the build process.

            For a complete list of options, run `docker buildx --help`.
