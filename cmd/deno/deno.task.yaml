documentation:
    command: '[AI] `deno task` is a command provided by Deno, a modern and secure TypeScript runtime, used to manage and execute tasks defined in a Deno project''s `deno.json` file. It locates the appropriate task based on its name, and runs it with specified options if provided. The `deno.json` file usually contains an array of tasks with their respective descriptions and executables. This command facilitates running automated tasks such as building, testing, or linting within a Deno project.'
    flag:
        config: '[AI] The `deno task --config` command is used in Deno, a modern JavaScript runtime, to load and apply a specific configuration file for tasks defined in a Deno monorepo (multiple projects under one folder). With this command, you can set up common build or test tasks across multiple projects within the same repository without having to repeat configurations for each individual project. The `--config` flag tells Deno to search for a `tasks.json` file at the specified location and use it as the task configuration.'
        help: '[AI] `deno task --help` is a command used in Deno, a modern JavaScript runtime, to display help information about the Deno Task Runner. The task runner is a tool that allows users to define tasks, which are collections of scripts and commands, and run them with a single command. The `--help` flag is used to provide detailed information about how to use the task runner, including available options, arguments, and usage examples.'
        no-config: '[AI] The `deno task` command is a utility provided by Deno, a modern and secure TypeScript runtime. The `--no-config` flag is an option that can be passed to this command, which instructs it to not load any project configuration files (denoted by the `deno.jsonc` file) before executing the task. This means that only the specified task will be run without applying any project-level configurations or extending the Deno environment with additional tools.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `deno task --quiet` command is used to run a Deno task with minimum output. The `--quiet` flag instructs Deno to suppress all messages and progress updates during the task execution, making the output focus on error messages only. This can be useful for running automated tasks or scripts where detailed feedback is not necessary.'
        unstable: '[AI] `deno task --unstable` is a command used in Deno, a modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. The `--unstable` flag enables the use of experimental features that are not yet stable and may change or break without notice. Using these features comes with the risk of encountering bugs or compatibility issues. It''s important to note that when working on projects that require production-ready code, it is generally recommended to avoid using experimental flags unless necessary. Instead, stick to the stable versions of Deno for optimal performance and reliability.'
