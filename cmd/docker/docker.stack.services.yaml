    command: '[AI] `docker stack services` is a Docker Swarm command used to list details of the services in a specified stack. It takes the name of the stack as an argument and displays information such as the service name, mode (replicated or global), desired state, current state, and replicas count. It can also filter the output based on specific labels or constraints.'
    flag:
        filter: '[AI] `docker stack services --filter` is a command used with Docker Swarm to filter and list services based on specific labels or properties. The `--filter` option allows specifying filters in the format `key=value`, such as `name=my-service` or `status=created`. This command helps in managing large numbers of services and easily identifying those that match certain criteria.'
        format: '[AI] `docker stack services --format` is a command used with Docker Swarm to customize the output format of service information in a stack. The `--format` option allows users to specify a Go template that will be used to transform the raw data returned by the command into the desired output format. This can be useful for automating or programmatically interacting with Docker Swarm services, as it enables users to extract specific information from the services in a stack in a flexible and customizable way.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `docker stack services --quit` command is used to list the names of all the services in a Docker Swarm stack in a quiet or minimal output format. It does not display any other information, such as the replica count or current status of each service. This can be useful when you want to quickly get a list of the services without unnecessary output.'
