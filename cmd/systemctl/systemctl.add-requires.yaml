description: Add 'Requires' dependency for the target on specified one or more units
group: unit file
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `systemctl add-requires` command is used in Systemd, a system and service manager for Linux operating systems, to specify that one unit (service, mount point, target, etc.) depends on another unit''s availability before it can be successfully started or activated. In other words, the first unit requires the second unit to be running or ready before it can function properly. This command modifies the systemd dependency file to establish the relationship between the units.'
