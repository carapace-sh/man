documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea labels` command is used in the context of the TeaDB database management system. It retrieves information about the labels assigned to various objects in the TeaDB database, such as tables or views. This can be helpful for organizing and managing database objects based on specific metadata. The exact output format may depend on the specific configuration of TeaDB.'
    flag:
        limit: '[AI] The `--limit` option used with the `tea labels` command in Kubernetes refers to setting a limit on the number of labels returned in the output. By default, all labels for the selected resources will be displayed. However, using `--limit <num>` will return only the first `<num>` labels for each resource. This can help reduce the amount of output and improve performance when dealing with a large number of resources.'
        login: |-
            [AI] The command `tea labels --login` is used in the `teaproject` open-source platform for managing Kubernetes clusters and applications. This specific command is related to handling authentication for accessing the Tea API. Here's a brief explanation:

            1. `tea`: It refers to the Tea CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, which allows users to interact with the Teaproject platform from their local terminal.
            2. `labels`: This is the action that follows the `tea` command. The `labels` action lets users manage labels assigned to different Kubernetes resources.
            3. `--login`: This option indicates that this command will handle logging in or authenticating a user to access the Teaproject API, enabling them to perform further operations using the CLI tool.
        output: |-
            [AI] The `--output` flag is an option used with the `tea labels` command in the `teaproject` tool in Kubernetes. This flag specifies where to write the output of the label query. It can be used to save the result as a file, or it can be piped to another command for further processing. For example:

            ```sh
            $ kubectl label pods my-pod -l app=my-app --output=json > labels.json
            ```

            This command gets the labels of all pods with the label `app=my-app`, and saves the output as a JSON file named `labels.json`.
        page: '[AI] The `--page` option in the `tea labels` command relates to pagination in the output of the labeling operation in GitHub''s `git-hub-page` tool for generating static websites, such as Jekyll or Hugo. Specifically, it is used to generate a separate page for each labeled item or issue in a repository. This allows visitors to navigate through pages dedicated to specific labels, making it easier to find and explore related content.'
        remote: '[AI] The `--remote` flag in the `tea labels` command is used to apply labels to resources in a remote Git repository instead of the local one. When using this option, tea will fetch the list of resources and their current labels from the remote repository, apply the new labels, and push the changes back to the remote repository. This is particularly useful when working collaboratively on projects that are hosted on a shared Git server.'
        repo: '[AI] The `tea labels --repo` command is used with Git, specifically with the tea tool for managing labels in a Git repository. This command fetches all the labels from a remote repository and applies them to the corresponding branches or tags locally. It assumes that there is an existing relationship between the local and remote repositories, often established through commands like `git fetch` or `git pull`. The --repo flag specifies the name of the remote repository.'
        save: '[AI] The `--save` option in the `tea labels` command is used to save or persist the newly created or modified labels in the active Git branch. This means that the next time you make a commit, these labels will be included in the commit message along with their associated annotations. It''s important for maintaining consistency and traceability of your Git project.'
