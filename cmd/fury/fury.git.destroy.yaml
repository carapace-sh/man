    --reset-only: Reset repo without destroying
documentation:
    command: |-
        [AI] The `git destroy` command is not a standard Git command. It seems like there might be a typo or confusion with other Git commands such as `git stash drop` or `git prune`.

        * `git stash drop` removes the most recently created stash, applying its changes to the working directory and index, and discarding the stash itself.
        * `git prune` is not a standard Git command. It could be a custom alias for other Git commands such as `git fetch --prune` or `git remote prune`, which remove the stale branches that Git tracks but no longer exist on the remote repository.
    flag:
        reset-only: '[AI] The `git reset --hard <commit>` command resets your local Git repository to the specified commit, discarding all changes made after that commit. The `--reset-only` option is an alternative way to use this command with Fury, a Git interface for Jenkins CI/CD tool. It only performs the `git reset --hard` operation without entering the interactive mode, which Fury provides for further customization. Therefore, using `fury git destroy --reset-only <commit>` is equivalent to using `git reset --hard <commit>` directly in a Git terminal but with the added convenience of using Fury''s interface within Jenkins.'
