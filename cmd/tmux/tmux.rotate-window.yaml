documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux` `rotate-window` command is used to rotate the selected pane or window in a Tmux terminal multiplexer session clockwise by 90 degrees. This allows you to change the orientation of panes, for example from a vertical layout to a horizontal one, facilitating multitasking and improving your productivity. By default, this command affects only the selected pane or window; however, it can be applied to multiple panes or windows using the `-U` (up), `-D` (down), `-L` (left), or `-R` (right) flags to specify the direction of rotation for all matched panes or windows.'
    flag:
        D: '[AI] The `tmux` command `rotate-window -D` is used to rotate the selected pane or window clockwise in a tmux terminal multiplexer session. The `-D` flag signifies that only the direction of rotation should be changed, leaving the size and position of the panes unaltered. This allows you to cycle through your windows in a specific order without disrupting their layout.'
        U: '[AI] `tmux` is a terminal multiplexer that allows splitting terminals into multiple panes and managing them in sessions. The command `tmux rotate-window -U` is used to rotate the window pane above the current one in the vertical direction within the same terminal session. This can be useful when you have multiple panes arranged vertically, and you want to switch focus to the next pane above.'
        Z: '[AI] The `tmux` command `rotate-window -Z` is used to vertically swap the position of two adjacent windows in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. The `-Z` option ensures that the swapped windows are stacked one above the other instead of side by side. This can be useful for arranging windows in a more space-efficient manner or when working on tasks that require focused viewing of multiple panes.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux` command `rotate-window -t` is used to rotate the position of the selected pane (window) in the TMUX terminal multiplexer environment by 90 degrees clockwise. The `-t` option specifies the target window or pane identifier to be rotated. This command can be useful for adjusting the layout and viewing different parts of a application or project within the same terminal session.'
