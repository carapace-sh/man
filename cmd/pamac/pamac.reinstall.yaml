documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pamac reinstall` command is used in Arch Linux and its derivatives to forcefully reinstall specific packages and their dependencies, overriding any local changes or customizations made in the system. This operation will download and install the latest available versions of the selected packages from the repositories. It''s typically employed when you suspect package corruption, misconfigurations, or want to restore packages to their original state after making unwanted changes.'
    flag:
        as-deps: '[AI] `pamac reinstall --as-deps` is a command used in Arch Linux to reinstall specific packages and their dependencies. The `--as-deps` option instructs Pacman, the package manager of Arch Linux, to only install the listed packages and their dependencies, without affecting other installed packages. By using `reinstall`, the existing configuration files are kept and replaced with new ones if needed. This command can be useful when dealing with broken or corrupted packages or when upgrading to a new version while keeping previous configurations.'
        as-explicit: '[AI] `pamac reinstall --as-explicit` is a command used in the Pacman package manager for Arch Linux. This command forces an explicit reinstallation of packages and their dependencies, overriding any previous installation or removal history. The option `--as-explicit` ensures that only the specified packages are affected, avoiding unintended consequences on other installed packages. It is useful when a package installation fails or when it''s necessary to restore a previously working configuration.'
        download-only: '[AI] `pamac reinstall --download-only` is a command used in Arch Linux for managing packages with the Pacman package manager. This specific command instructs Pacman to download only the necessary files for reinstalling a package without actually performing the installation or making any changes on the system. It''s useful when you want to update your local package cache, retrieve new package versions, or prepare for an offline installation.'
        no-confirm: |-
            [AI] The `pamac reinstall` command with the `--no-confirm` option is used to force reinstall selected packages in Pacman, Arch Linux's package manager. It skips the confirmation step during installation, allowing the process to proceed without user intervention.

            Here's a brief explanation of each part of the command:

            1. `pamac`: This refers to the package manager for Arch Linux called "Pacman Arch Build System" (or simply "PAMAC"). It provides additional features and improvements over the standard Pacman.
            2. `reinstall`: This is the action that instructs PAMAC to reinstall or update the selected packages.
            3. `--no-confirm`: This option skips the confirmation step during installation. By default, Pacman will prompt for user approval before installing any package. However, with `--no-confirm`, PAMAC will bypass this step and proceed with the installation without asking for confirmation.
        overwrite: '[AI] `pamac reinstall --overwrite` is a command used in Arch Linux to force reinstall specific packages and their dependencies, replacing any existing files with new ones from the official repository. This can be useful when dealing with corrupted or outdated package installations, or when making configuration changes that require a fresh installation of a package while keeping other settings intact. The `--overwrite` flag allows for replacement of existing files without prompting for confirmation.'
