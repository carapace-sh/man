documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm repo` command is used to interact with an npm (Node Package Manager) registry repository. It''s typically followed by the name of a specific repository, such as `npm repo list <repo-name>` which lists the packages in that repository or `npm repo view <repo-url>` which displays detailed information about the given repository. This command is essential for users and organizations managing npm repositories or working with private registries.'
    flag:
        browser: '[AI] `npm repo --browser` is a command used with Node Package Manager (npm). It''s used to clone the npm registry source code, specifically for the browser-based version of npm. This version is intended to run in the browser environment, such as in a web worker or a web application using Isomorphic-Fetch or similar solutions. The command line instruction retrieves the repository from GitHub and sets up the development environment.'
        workspace: '[AI] `npm run --workspace` is a command used in Node.js projects managed with npm (Node Package Manager). This command runs a script specified in the `scripts` section of the package.json file, but it does so for a particular workspace within a multi-package project. When using npm workspaces, each package has its own package.json file and can have its own scripts and dependencies. By specifying `--workspace`, you''re telling npm to run the script in the context of that specific workspace rather than the root workspace.'
        workspaces: |-
            [AI] `npm repo --workspaces` is a command used with npm (Node Package Manager) to interact with a monorepo (monolithic repository), which contains multiple packages that share the same `node_modules` directory and `package.json` files at the repository root.

            This command enables or disables the workspaces feature in an `npm` configuration, located in the `.npmrc` file. When enabled (default is true), each package in a monorepo can independently install its own dependencies using `npm install`.

            The `--workspaces` option specifically allows you to toggle the workspaces feature on or off for a single command, without changing the global configuration.
