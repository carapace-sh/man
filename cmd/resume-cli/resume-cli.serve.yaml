    command: '[AI] The `resume-cli serve` command is used in Resume.io, a web-based resume builder platform, to start a local development server. This command allows users to preview and test changes to their resumes in real time before publishing them online. It typically requires the installation of Node.js and the Resume.io CLI tool, and is run from the project directory in a terminal or command prompt. Once executed, the resume will be accessible at a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`) for editing and viewing.'
    flag:
        dir: '[AI] `resume-cli serve --dir` is a command used in the Resume CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. This command starts a local development server for serving static files or a built React app. The `--dir` option specifies the directory to serve, which can be a folder containing the static files or the built project output. When executed, this command will start the server and make the served content accessible at a specified URL in your browser.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The command `resume-cli serve --help` is used with the Resume CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for Node.js application called resume-api, which allows creating, managing, and serving resume files as APIs.

            The `--help` flag is an option that provides a detailed explanation of the available commands, their usage, and options when running the `serve` command. It's useful for understanding how to use the tool correctly and efficiently. For instance, it might display something like:

            ```bash
            Usage: resume-cli serve [options]

            Options:
              -p, --port <port>   Port number to run the server on (default: 3000)
              -h, --host <host>    IP address or hostname to bind the server to (default: localhost)
              -l, --log            Enable verbose logging
              -c, --config <file>   Path to a custom resume configuration file.
            ```

            This output demonstrates that you can use the `serve` command with various options such as setting the port number, specifying an IP address or hostname, enabling verbose logging, and using a custom resume configuration file.
        port: '[AI] `resume-cli serve --port` is a command used with the Resume CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. It starts the Resume server in CLI mode and sets the port number to the specified value, enabling others to access the server over the network to share resumes or receive resume requests. The server listens for incoming connections and responds with JSON formatted resume data.'
        resume: '[AI] `resume-cli serve --resume` is a command used with the Resume CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. This specific command starts the resume server with resume functionality enabled. When the resume-cli is serving a resume, it keeps track of its state and allows for the resume to be updated or reloaded without losing the current connection or session with potential employers or recruiters using tools like Calendly, HireSense, or Ideal. The --resume option ensures that this functionality is activated when starting the server.'
        silent: '[AI] `resume-cli serve --silent` is a command used with the Resume-API (api.resumevm.io) to start a local server in silent mode. This means that no output or logs will be displayed during execution, making it useful for background processing or automated setups where minimal interaction is required.'
        theme: '[AI] `resume-cli serve --theme` is a command used with the "resume-cli" tool in Node.js. It starts a local development server to preview and showcase a resume built with Markdown files using a specific theme. The "--theme" option specifies which theme to use for rendering the resume content.'
