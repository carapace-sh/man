        [AI] The `gh issue comment` command is used with the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) to add a new comment to an existing issue on a GitHub repository. The basic syntax of the command is:

        ```bash
        gh issue comment ADD <issue-number> [<comment>]
        ```

        Replace `<issue-number>` with the number of the specific issue you want to add a comment to, and `[<comment>]` with the text you want to write as your comment. If you don't include `[<comment>]`, you will be prompted to enter your comment in the terminal before it is added.
    flag:
        body: '[AI] The `--body` option in the `gh issue comment` command is used to specify the text content of a new comment to be added on a GitHub Issue. This command is typically used within GitHub Actions workflows or scripts that interact with the GitHub API, allowing automation of issue commenting. The body argument can contain plain text, Markdown, or even emojis for more expressive and engaging comments.'
        body-file: '[AI] `gh issue comment --body-file` is a command used in the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) to create or add a comment on an issue with the content from a file instead of typing it directly. The flag `--body-file` specifies the path to that file. This feature can be useful when drafting and editing the comment''s text before submitting it as part of a script or automation workflow.'
        edit-last: '[AI] The `gh issue comment --edit-last` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to edit the most recent comment made on a specific GitHub Issue. This command allows users to modify or correct errors in their last comment without creating a new one, maintaining a clear and accurate issue thread. It helps keep the conversation organized and efficient within an issue.'
        editor: '[AI] The `gh issue comment --editor` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to edit a comment on an issue in a GitHub repository. It takes you into an interactive editor where you can modify the content of the comment before saving and applying the changes back to the issue.'
        web: '[AI] `gh issue comment --web` is a command used in GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, `gh`. This command allows you to create or reply to an issue comment on a GitHub repository using the web interface, directly from the terminal. The flag `--web` specifies that the comment interaction should open in a web browser rather than in the terminal itself.'
