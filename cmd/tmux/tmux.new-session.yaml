documentation:
    command: '[AI] `tmux new-session` is a command used in the Terminal Multiplexer (tmux) application to create a new terminal session. When you run this command, it starts a new detached session, meaning it runs in the background and can be reattached to later. This is useful for running long-running processes or multiple processes in separate terminal windows while keeping them organized within a single tmux environment.'
    flag:
        A: '[AI] The command `tmux new-session -A` creates a new terminal multiplexer session with the "-A" (or --attach) option attached to an existing session if one exists. If no such session is found, it starts a new session in detached mode, running in the background. This is useful when starting a long-running process or when logging into a remote server. The session can be later reattached using `tmux attach` command.'
        D: '[AI] `tmux new-session -D` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to create a new detached session. The `-D` option tells Tmux to run the new session in detached mode by default, meaning it will run in the background and not attach a terminal window to it. This can be useful for running long-running processes or scripts without keeping an open terminal window dedicated to that process.'
        E: '[AI] `tmux new-session -E` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to create a new session with the `-E` (or `--create-mode`) option. This option enables the creation of a new session even if one already exists with that name, instead of simply attaching to the existing session. Therefore, it effectively creates a new session from scratch.'
        F: '[AI] `tmux new-session -F` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to create a new terminal session with a specified terminal title. The `-F` option allows specifying a custom title for the new session, which can be useful for organizing multiple sessions and identifying them easily within Tmux or when viewing the list of sessions using other tools like `htop` or `ps`.'
        P: '[AI] `tmux new-session -P` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to create a new terminal session with the specified options. The `-P` option stands for "new-session -prefix P". This means that a new session will be created with the default prefix key set to ''P'' instead of the default value ''Ctrl+B''. This allows users to customize their keyboard shortcuts in the Tmux environment.'
        X: '[AI] The command `tmux new-session -X` creates a new tmux session with the `-X` (or `--create-mode`) option set, which bypasses interactive prompting and immediately exits after creating the new session. This can be useful for automating or scripting tmux sessions. The session is empty when created and can be further configured or attached to using other tmux commands.'
        c: '[AI] `tmux new-session -c` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to create a new session and attach to it in the same shell terminal window. The `-c` option specifies the command to run inside the new session upon creation, effectively starting a new process within that session. This can be useful for automatically launching applications or scripts when starting a new Tmux session.'
        d: '[AI] `tmux new-session -d` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that creates a new terminal session in detached mode. Detached mode means the session runs in the background, allowing you to disconnect from the terminal without terminating the running processes or applications within the session. The new session is created empty, ready for you to attach to it later using `tmux attach` and start your work.'
        e: '[AI] The `tmux` command `new-session -e` creates a new terminal multiplexing session and immediately enters an interactive shell within that session. The `-e` flag stands for "start a new shell in the session". This is often used when you want to run a long-running process or command inside a detached tmux session.'
        f: '[AI] `tmux new-session -f` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to create a new terminal session in the foreground. The `-f` option ensures that Tmux attaches to the new session immediately after creation, allowing you to interact with it right away.'
        "n": '[AI] `tmux new-session -n` is a command used in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to create a new session with the specified name `-n`. If no name is provided, a numbered session will be created instead. This command creates a new terminal window or reattaches to an existing detached session and brings it to the front.'
        s: '[AI] `tmux new-session -s` is a command used in the Terminal Multiplexer (tmux) application. This command creates and enters a new tmux session with the given name or number specified by `-s`. If no name is provided, a new session will be created with a default number. Once the new session is created, you will be attached to it and can start running commands in that environment.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux new-session` command creates a new terminal session in the GNU Screen-like terminal multiplexer called TMUX. The `-t` option allows you to give a named session title, which can be useful for identifying and managing multiple sessions. So, `tmux new-session -t "SessionName"` starts a new TMUX session with the given name.'
        x: '[AI] The `tmux new-session` command with the `-x` option creates a new tmux session in window mode with multiple windows horizontally split across the session. By default, tmux creates a single session with a single window. The `-x` flag instructs tmux to create multiple windows in the new session, divided into horizontal splits. This can be useful for working on multiple tasks within the same session.'
        "y": '[AI] The command `tmux new-session -y` creates a new terminal session using the TMUX terminal multiplexer. The `-y` flag is used to automatically yes (auto-y) answer any Yes/No questions that tmux might ask during the session creation process, such as "Create new window?" or "Detach after creating session?" This option can be useful when you want to create a session with specific settings and don''t want to be prompted for confirmation each time.'
