documentation:
    command: '[AI] `flutter pub upgrade` is a command used in Flutter development to update the packages listed in the project''s `pubspec.yaml` file to their latest versions. It fetches the updated package definitions from the Flutter Package Index, and then updates the `flutter.pubspec` file with the new dependencies and their corresponding version numbers. This command helps keep your project up-to-date with the latest packages and their improvements or bug fixes.'
    flag:
        directory: '[AI] The `flutter pub upgrade --directory` command is used to upgrade the published dependencies of a Flutter project. It should be run from the root directory of the project (specified with `--directory`) and will automatically fetch and apply the latest versions of all listed dependencies in the `pubspec.yaml` file, while also resolving any new dependency conflicts.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `flutter pub upgrade --dry-run` is a command used in Flutter development to check what packages and their versions would be upgraded or installed without actually performing the upgrade. It simulates the effect of running `flutter pub upgrade` but only displays the proposed changes in the terminal. This can help developers assess potential impacts on their projects before executing the actual upgrade.'
        help: '[AI] `flutter pub upgrade --help` is a command used in the Flutter framework for managing dependencies. This specific command displays help information about the "upgrade" sub-command of the Flutter Pub package manager. It explains how to use this command to update the current project''s packages to their latest versions, including any prerequisites and available options.'
        major-versions: '[AI] `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions` is a command used in Flutter development to update all the packages in the project''s `pubspec.yaml` file to their major versions instead of the patch or minor updates. This command can be run in the terminal or command prompt, and it may require confirming the package upgrades before they are installed since major version updates might introduce new breaking changes that could impact the application.'
        no-offline: '[AI] `flutter pub upgrade --no-offline` is a command used in Flutter development to upgrade all the packages listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file. The `--no-offline` flag tells Flutter to fetch the latest package versions from the internet instead of using locally cached packages. This ensures that you have the most up-to-date packages when making upgrades.'
        no-precompile: '[AI] `flutter pub upgrade --no-precompile` is a command used in Flutter development to upgrade the packages listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file without recompiling the application code. The `--no-precompile` option disables the Flutter build process that occurs during package upgrades, which can save time and resources by avoiding a full rebuild of the app. However, this also means that any changes to the dependencies'' code will not be reflected in the app until you manually run `flutter build`.'
        null-safety: '[AI] `flutter pub upgrade --null-safety` is a command used in Flutter development for upgrading packages in a project while enabling null safety. The `--null-safety` option enables the Null Safety feature introduced in Dart 2.12, which helps prevent null pointer exceptions at compile time. The `flutter pub upgrade` command then updates all specified dependencies to their latest versions.'
        offline: '[AI] `flutter pub upgrade --offline` is a command used in Flutter development to perform package upgrades without connecting to the internet. This is particularly useful when you want to ensure that your project builds consistently, even if certain packages have been taken offline or if there''s limited network connectivity. The command will look for locally cached versions of packages and upgrade them if available, otherwise it will fail without attempting an online search.'
        precompile: '[AI] `flutter pub upgrade --precompile` is a command used in Flutter development to perform several tasks at once. It upgrades all the dependencies listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file to their latest versions. Additionally, it enables precompilation of those packages for faster app startup time and smaller APK/APP sizes. This means that the Dart code from the dependent packages is compiled into native machine code before the app is installed or run, reducing the need to parse and compile the code at runtime.'
