        [AI] The `systemctl switch-root` command is a systemd utility used to switch the current system root directory for system services and processes. It's typically used during boot processes, such as when initiating a multi-boot system or running live CD distributions from a USB stick, to allow system services to run with access to their respective files and directories.

        In simpler terms, it lets you tell the systemd init system to change the root directory of the running system, effectively allowing you to work on another root filesystem while keeping the original one intact.
