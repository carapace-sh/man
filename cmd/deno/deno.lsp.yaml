documentation:
    command: '[AI] `deno lsp` is a command provided by Deno, a modern and secure TypeScript runtime, to start an Language Server Protocol (LSP) session. LSP is a communication protocol that enables editors and IDEs to interactively get intelligent code assistance from the server-side tooling like type checking, autocomplete suggestions, formatting, etc. In Deno context, running `deno lsp` starts an LSP server in the current directory with the default TypeScript configuration, waiting for clients to connect and request services.'
