documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `git maintenance` command is not a standard Git command. There is no Git command named `register` in the context of maintenance. Git is a version control system and does not have built-in commands specifically for system or application maintenance tasks, such as registering maintenance events or managing deployments. If you meant to ask about specific Git workflow strategies like GitFlow or GitHub Flow which include maintenance releases, those are separate concepts and don''t have corresponding `git register` commands either.'
