documentation:
    command: '[AI] `waypoint exec` is a command used in Docker Compose and Waypoint, an open-source application deployment tool for multiple clusters. It allows executing a command on a specific service or container within a deployed application without having to SSH into the host machine or manually accessing each container. The general syntax is `waypoint exec [OPTIONS] [SERVICE] [COMMAND] ...`, where `[OPTIONS]` are additional flags, `[SERVICE]` is the name of the Docker service, and `[COMMAND]` is the command to be executed.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `waypoint exec` command is a part of HashiCorp''s Nomad and Consul toolset. It allows users to execute arbitrary shell commands on a service or task running in the Nomad cluster. The `--app` flag specifies the name or ID of the app, service, or task whose container you want to run the command against. For example, `waypoint exec --app my_app my_command arg1 arg2` will execute `my_command` with arguments `arg1` and `arg2` inside the container running `my_app`.'
        instance: '[AI] `waypoint exec` is a command from Hashicorp''s Nomad and Consul toolset for executing commands on tasks or nodes managed by those systems. The `--instance` argument specifies which instance (i.e., task or node) the command should be run against. For example, `waypoint exec --instance my_task my_command arg1 arg2` runs `my_command` with arguments `arg1` and `arg2` on the task named `my_task`.'
        plain: '[AI] `waypoint exec` is a command-line tool in Hashicorp''s Nomad cluster management platform used to execute ad-hoc tasks on running jobs or services. The `--plain` flag modifies the output format of the command. Instead of providing a human-readable output with progress indicators and other details, it produces raw, plain text output that can be more easily parsed by scripts or other automated tools. This might include JSON or other structured formats, depending on the specific use case.'
        project: '[AI] `waypoint exec` is a command from HashiCorp''s Waypoint tool, used to execute ad-hoc tasks or commands in remote environments managed by Waypoint. The `--project` option specifies the name of the Waypoint project where the task will be executed. It helps Waypoint identify the correct configuration and context for connecting to the target environment.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint exec` command in the Docker Desktop Kubernetes cluster management tool is used to run a command in a specific container or pod within a Kubernetes cluster. The `--workspace` flag specifies the name of the Workspace, which is a logical grouping of resources in the Docker Desktop environment. It helps users manage and organize their applications, services, and environments more effectively. When you use this command with `--workspace <name>`, it will target and execute the command within the containers or pods belonging to that specific Workspace.'
