        [AI] `xdotool windowsize` is a command-line tool for interacting with the X Window System's graphical user interface (GUI). The specific command `windowsize` is used to set or retrieve the size of an open X11 window.

        When you provide a window ID as an argument, `xdotool windowsize` will return the current width and height of that window. If you also provide new dimensions as arguments, then `xdotool windowsize` will resize the specified window to those given dimensions.
    flag:
        sync: '[AI] `xdotool` is a versatile tool for automating interactive tasks in the X Window System. The command `xdotool windowsize --sync <window_id> <width> <height>` is used to set the size of an open window with the given ID synchronously. The `--sync` option ensures that the operation waits until the window''s new size has been applied before continuing. This can be useful for scripts where you want to ensure that a window is resized before moving on to the next step.'
        usehints: '[AI] `xdotool windowsize` is a command-line utility for interacting with X11 graphical user interface (GUI) applications using the xdotool tool. The specific command `xdotool windowsize --usehints <window_id> <width> <height>` sets the size of the specified window identified by its ID to the given dimensions `<width>` and `<height>`, while using hints from the window manager if available to optimally fit the content within the new size. The `--usehints` option ensures that the window size adjustment takes into account any minimum or preferred sizes set by the window manager.'
