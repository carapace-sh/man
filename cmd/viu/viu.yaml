documentation:
    command: '[AI] "viu" is not a standard Unix or Linux command, it seems to be non-existent. It might be a typo or an abbreviation of unknown meaning depending on the specific context. In general, the "vi" and "vim" editors are popular text editors in Unix-like systems with the commands starting with "vi" standing for "visual editor". However, there''s no command named "viu" within those editors.'
    flag:
        blocks: '[AI] The `--blocks` flag is a command-line option for Viu, a text editor that runs in the Vi and Vim modal. This flag enables block mode in Viu, which allows the user to perform text manipulation on entire blocks of text at once. Blocks are defined as lines with common beginning and end points. With this flag enabled, users can perform actions like copying, deleting, or moving multiple lines at once using simple keyboard shortcuts.'
        frame-rate: '[AI] The `--frame-rate` flag in FFmpeg''s `vui` (Video User Interface) library is used to set or modify the display refresh rate of a video stream. It allows specifying the desired number of frames per second (fps) for the video, ensuring that compatible playback devices will render the content at the intended frame rate. This can help improve syncing issues and ensure a more consistent viewing experience across different systems.'
        height: '[AI] The `--height` option in the `viu` command-line tool relates to the vertical size of the terminal window where `viu` is being run. It sets the height of the text display area within the terminal. By specifying a numerical value with this flag, users can adjust the height of the output to better fit their terminal windows or preferences.'
        help: '[AI] The `--help` option is a common command-line argument used in various programs, including the Viu data visualization tool. When you run `viu --help`, it displays detailed information about how to use Viu effectively. This includes a brief description of the program, a list of available commands or subcommands, and explanations for each option and its usage. The help text also often includes examples to clarify how to use certain options in practice. In summary, `viu --help` provides you with essential information on using Viu effectively and correctly.'
        mirror: '[AI] The `--mirror` option in Viu, a Git-like version control system for Kubernetes manifests, instructs it to create a mirror of an existing repository instead of initiating a new one during the `init` or `clone` command. In this mode, Viu fetches all the objects and branches from the source repository but does not write any changes back. This can be useful when you want to keep a local copy of a remote repository for offline use or reference without modifying its content.'
        name: '[AI] The `--name` option in the Viu CLI (Command Line Interface) command is used to specify a name for a new project or task being created with Viu. This name will be used as an identifier and label for the project within the Viu system, making it easier to find and manage among other projects.'
        once: '[AI] The `--once` flag for the `viu` command in Git is used to perform a single automatic merge or rebase operation with conflict resolution, instead of a continuous process that requires manual intervention at every conflict. In other words, it automates the first step of an interactive merge or rebase process and then stops if conflicts arise. This can be useful when you want to apply a specific change from one branch to another but prefer to resolve any conflicts manually.'
        recursive: '[AI] `viu` is a tool used in Perl to perform various input/output operations, such as filtering or transforming files. The option `--recursive` that follows `viu` is used to recursively apply the specified operation on all files and subdirectories within a given directory. When you run a command like `viu --recursive some_command .`, it will perform the specified command on the current directory, as well as all files and subdirectories nested within it. This can be useful for performing operations on entire project trees or large collections of files.'
        static: '[AI] The `--static` flag for the Viu command-line interface (CLI) tool is used to indicate that static files should be processed instead of dynamic ones. Static files are unchanging data, such as HTML, CSS, and image files, which are served directly to the user when they request a webpage. In contrast, dynamic files are generated on-the-fly based on user requests or other inputs. By using the `--static` flag, Viu will process only the static files specified in the command and generate the appropriate output for serving them over a web application.'
        transparent: '[AI] The `--transparent` flag in Viu is an option used to make the video or media streamed through Viu appear as a transparent window on the screen. This means that the content of the stream will be visible, but the background behind it can also be seen through. It''s often used for multitasking or watching videos while working on other things. Note that this feature may depend on the specific capabilities of your media player or operating system.'
        version: '[AI] The `viu` command with the `--version` option is used to display information about the installed version of the Vim-plugins-uhp (Viu) utility, which is a plugin manager for Vim. When you run `viu --version`, it will print out the version number of Viu, along with some additional information such as the Git commit hash and the build date. This command helps users to check if they have the latest version of Viu installed and also provides useful debugging information in case of any issues.'
        width: '[AI] The `--width` option in the `viu` command is used to specify the width of the terminal or output window in characters. This option helps ensure that the output from `viu` commands, such as listing or formatting text, fits correctly within the given terminal size. Adjusting the width with this flag allows for better visualization and readability of the output data.'
