documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm access public` command is used in Node.js package management with npm (Node Package Manager). This command grants public publishing access to an npm registry account. Once you have run this command with your npm authentication token, anyone can publish packages under that account without requiring two-factor authentication. This command should be used with caution as it may allow unauthorized access to your account if the token is compromised.'
