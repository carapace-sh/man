documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `qmk new-keymap` command is used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware to create a new custom keyboard layout or keymap from scratch. When executed, it will generate a new directory with default files for a basic QMK keymap, including a makefile and source code files for the keyboard matrix and key events. This command is typically run in a terminal or command prompt within a QMK project folder to initialize a new keymap development.'

            [AI] `qmk new-keymap --help` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware to create a new custom keyboard layout or keymap. Here's a brief explanation of its usage:

            --help: Displays detailed help information about creating a new keymap using `qmk new-keymap`. This includes instructions, options, and examples for setting up your project.

            `qmk new-keymap [PROJECT_NAME]`: Creates a new QMK keymap project with the given name (optional if not provided, a default name is used). After running this command, you'll be guided through the process of configuring your layout using various files.

            For more information on specific options and file configurations, refer to the official QMK documentation or use `qmk new-keymap --help` with specific flags to learn about each one.
        keyboard: '[AI] `qmk new-keymap --keyboard` is a command used in the QMK firmware platform to create a new custom keyboard layout or keymap. The `--keyboard` option specifies which keyboard model or layout the new keymap will be for. This command initiates the setup process for a new keymap, and you''ll be prompted to define various aspects of your keyboard layout using JSON files. Once configured, the QMK compiler will generate the custom firmware for your specific keyboard model based on your design.'
        keymap: '[AI] `qmk new-keymap --keymap` is a command used with the QMK firmware (a popular open-source microcontroller firmware for keyboards) to create a new custom keyboard layout or keymap from scratch. The `--keymap` flag specifies the name of the new keymap to be created. This command initializes a new directory with the given name under the `qmk_firmware/keyboards` folder, and sets up an empty keymap file (`<keymap-name>.h`) inside it. From there, you can edit the keymap file using a text editor or any QMK-compatible software to define your desired keyboard layout.'
