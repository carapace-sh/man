    command: '[AI] `swaymsg` is a command-line utility for interacting with the Sway window manager in the Linux environment. It allows users to send various signals and queries to manipulate open windows, create new ones, or adjust settings dynamically. Common uses include moving windows between workspaces, resizing, focusing, or quitting applications.'
    flag:
        help: |-
            [AI] `swaymsg` is a message bus communication tool for the Sway window manager in Linux. The `--help` option displays detailed usage information about available commands and their options. Here's a brief summary:

            - `swaymsg` is used to communicate with running Sway instances through a message bus.
            - You can send various types of messages (e.g., window management, workspaces, etc.) using different commands.
            - The `--help` option shows a list of available commands and their usage information, including supported options and examples.
            - To use it, run the command as follows: `swaymsg --help [COMMAND]`, where `[COMMAND]` is an optional command name to get help for specifically that command. For instance, to get help on the focus command, use: `swaymsg --help focus`.
        monitor: '[AI] `swaymsg --monitor` is a command used in the Sway window manager for i3-compatible Wayland compositors. It enables real-time monitoring of the Sway output, allowing users to inspect and interact with the current state of the workspace and its containers through the Wayland protocol. The command does not produce any visible output but keeps the connection open for receiving updates from the Sway compositor.'
        pretty: '[AI] `swaymsg --pretty` is a command-line utility for interacting with the Sway window manager. The `--pretty` option is used to display output in a human-readable format, often with colored and formatted text. For example, when querying the workspaces or windows, the output will be presented as a list with clear indicators for each item, making it easier to understand and interpret.'
        quiet: '[AI] `swaymsg` is a message bus for the i3-based window manager Sway. The command `swaymsg --quiet` is used to send messages to Sway without printing any output or error messages in the terminal. This can be useful when running scripts or automation tasks where you don''t want unnecessary output.'
        raw: |-
            [AI] `swaymsg` is a command-line tool for interacting with the Sway window manager. The `--raw` option is used to send raw JSON messages directly to Sway, bypassing the built-in message parsing and conversion. This can be useful for sending complex or custom messages that may not be supported through other means. For example, you might use this command to configure a floating window with specific properties:

            ```sh
            swaymsg --raw '{"type":"config.set","id":"my_floating_window", "properties":{"floated":true, "x":100, "y":200, "width":300, "height":400}}'
            ```

            This command sets the properties of a window with the ID `my_floating_window` to make it float at position (100, 200) and set its size to 300x400 pixels. Note that you should replace `"id":"my_floating_window"` with the actual ID of the window you want to configure.
        socket: '[AI] `swaymsg` is a command-line tool for interacting with the Sway window manager, which is used to manage the desktop environment in a Linux system. The `--socket` option specifies that `swaymsg` should connect to Sway using Unix domain sockets instead of over a network connection. This allows `swaymsg` to communicate directly with the running instance of Sway on the local machine, enabling the execution of various commands for window management, focusing windows, and querying information about running applications or the desktop environment itself.'
        type: '[AI] `swaymsg` is a message bus used by the i3-wm and sway window managers to communicate with running applications and the window manager itself. The `--type` option specifies the type of message to send. Sway messages can be of various types such as `focus`, `output`, `move`, `quit`, etc. For example, `swaymsg focus id <window_id> --type request` sends a focus request message to the window manager for the given window ID.'
        version: '[AI] `swaymsg` is a message bus used by the tiling window manager Sway. The command `swaymsg --version` is used to display the version information of the installed `swaymsg` application, including its version number and build date.'
