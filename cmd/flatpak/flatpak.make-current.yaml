    command: '[AI] `flatpak make-current` is a command used in the Flatpak packaging system to create a new branch based on the current state of a Flatpak application, including its source code and dependencies. This command is typically used when developing or maintaining a Flatpak application to easily create new releases. It generates a manifest file, which describes the application and its dependencies, allowing you to build and distribute the new version through the Flatpak platform.'
    flag:
        arch: '[AI] `flatpak make-current` is a command used in the Flatpak packaging system to create a new, up-to-date version of an existing application bundle. The `--arch` option specifies the target architecture for the newly created bundle. This means that if you run `flatpak make-current --arch x86_64`, it will create or update the application bundle with the latest available packages that are compatible with the 64-bit x86 architecture. The result is a new, self-contained and upgradable bundle that includes the latest version of the application along with all its dependencies.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `flatpak make-current` is a command-line tool provided by Flatpak, a software deployment and application packaging system. This command creates or updates a new Flatpak branch for an existing application, allowing developers to easily package and distribute updates.

            Usage: `flatpak make-current [OPTIONS] REPOSITORY [BRANCH]`

            * REPOSITORY: The path to the repository containing the Flatpak manifest files (repomaker.yaml).
            * BRANCH: An optional branch name, if not provided it will create a new branch based on the latest commit.

            Options include:

            * `--help`: Prints out detailed help information about the command.
            * `--no-interactive`: Suppresses user interaction prompts during the build process.
            * `--keep-history`: Preserves the entire history of the branch instead of creating a new one based on the latest commit.
            * `--repo-url`: Sets the URL for the remote repository to clone if cloning it for the first time.
            * `--branch-prefix`: Prepends a given prefix to the new branch name.
            * `--force`: Forces the creation of a new branch even if an existing one exists with the same name.

            This command helps developers maintain and distribute updated versions of their Flatpak applications easily while ensuring that users receive consistent and secure software packages.
        installation: '[AI] The `flatpak make-current` command is used to create a new, up-to-date Flatpak application bundle for an existing project. The `--installation` option specifies that the output of this command should be installed directly on the local system. This means that after running `flatpak make-current --installation`, the latest version of the application will be downloaded, built, and installed using Flatpak, making it available for use.'
        ostree-verbose: '[AI] `flatpak make-current` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to create a new, up-to-date version of an application bundle. The `--ostree-verbose` option increases the verbosity level when interacting with OSTree, which is the underlying version control system that Flatpak uses for its repositories. This flag displays detailed information about the repository checks, commits, and other OSTree operations performed during the bundle creation process.'
        system: '[AI] `flatpak make-current --system` is a command used in Flatpak, a software deployment and packaging system for Linux platforms. This command creates or updates a new system branch of a Flatpak application or runtime. System branches are used to manage applications that should be available for all users on a system, unlike regular user branches which are specific to individual users. The `--system` option specifies that the changes should be made to the system branch instead of a user branch. Once created or updated, new versions of applications or runtimes can be easily installed and managed across all user sessions on a given system.'
        user: '[AI] `flatpak make-current --user` is a command used in the Flatpak package manager for creating a new, up-to-date version of an existing application installation. It specifically targets user installations. The command fetches the latest sources from the repository, applies any necessary patches or modifications, builds the software and installs it as a new version while keeping the previous one intact. This allows users to test new features or bug fixes without affecting their current usage of the application.'
        verbose: '[AI] `flatpak make-current` is a command used in the Flatpak package management system to create a new, custom branch of an existing repository, based on the current state of that repository. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount and detail of output provided by the command, helping users understand each step in the process of creating a new branch. The result is a new branch that can be used for developing and testing changes to the repository before merging them back into the main branch.'
