documentation:
    command: '[AI] `brew uninstall` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to remove previously installed software and their associated files from your system. When you run this command followed by the name of the installed package or formula, Homebrew locates and deletes the installation, including any linked files and symlinks. It does not delete user data or configuration files unless explicitly told to do so with additional flags.'
    flag:
        cask: '[AI] `brew uninstall --cask` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command is used to uninstall Homebrew Cask packages or applications that were installed using the `brew install --cask` command. The `--cask` option is used with brew to manage graphical user interface (GUI) applications instead of the traditional Unix-style packages. When you run `brew uninstall --cask <package-name>`, Homebrew will remove the specified Cask package along with its associated configuration files and symlinks.'
        debug: '[AI] The command `brew uninstall --debug` is used to uninstall a package managed by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, while generating debug output.

This can be helpful for troubleshooting or understanding what actions Homebrew is taking as it removes the software from your system.'
        force: '[AI] `brew uninstall --force` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command forces the uninstallation of a previously installed Homebrew package along with all its associated files and dependencies.

It is useful when you want to completely remove an installed package without any leftovers.'
        formula: '[AI] `brew uninstall --formula` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to uninstall Homebrew-installed packages or formulas with their dependencies. The `--formula` option specifies that you want to uninstall a specific formula (i.e., package) by name.
