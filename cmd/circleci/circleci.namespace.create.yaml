    command: '[AI] The `circleci namespace create` command is used to create a new namespace in CircleCI, which is a platform for continuous integration and delivery. A namespace allows you to organize and manage your projects, teams, and resources within CircleCI. This command creates a new namespace with the given name and sets it as the current context for further CircleCI commands.'
    flag:
        integration-testing: '[AI] The `circleci namespace create --integration-testing` command is used to create a new Namespace in CircleCI with the given name `--integration-testing`. A Namespace is a logical partitioning of resources and data within CircleCI. By appending `--integration-testing`, you are specifically creating a Namespace that is intended for running Integration Tests. This command line instruction sets up an environment for managing tests that interact with multiple services or systems, enhancing test isolation and security in your continuous integration pipeline.'
        no-prompt: '[AI] The `circleci namespace create` command is used to create a new CircleCI Namespace in the CircleCI platform, which is essentially a logical grouping of projects and permissions. The `--no-prompt` flag is an optional argument that disables interactive prompts during execution. This means that any input required by the command will be provided as arguments instead of being requested interactively. In summary, this command creates a new CircleCI Namespace without asking for confirmation or input during its execution.'
