documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `glab repo archive` command is used with GitLab''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool called Glab. This command archives a local Git repository as a tar or zip file and saves it to the current directory. This can be useful for creating backups, sharing large repositories, or moving the repository to another location while keeping its history intact.'
    flag:
        format: |-
            [AI] `git fetch --unshallow` is a Git command used to clone or update a repository from a remote server, even if the local repository was initially cloned using `git clone --recurse` with the `--single-branch` option which creates a shallow clone.

            The `glab` tool is a wrapper around Git commands, designed for easier use and more convenient syntax. The command `glab repo archive --format` is used to create an archive of a Git repository in a specific format (such as `tar`, `zip`, or `gztar`). This can be useful when you want to share or backup your repository.

            The flags `--unshallow` and `--deepen` may be added to the command, respectively, to update a shallow clone and make it a full clone (i.e., retrieve all of the history and branches from the remote). For example:

            ```bash
            glab repo archive --format=tar --unshallow my-repo.git
            ```

            This command will create an archived tarball of the repository `my-repo.git`, update it to a full clone, and save the result in the current directory with the name `my-repo.git.tar`.
        sha: '[AI] The `glab repo archive --sha` command is used in GitLab''s command-line tool, Glab, to download an archive of a specific repository at a particular commit or tag represented by its SHA (Short Hash). This allows you to save the repository''s state at that specific point in time. The output will be saved as a .tar or .zip file, depending on your system settings.'
