documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl rescue` is a command used in Linux systems with systemd init system. It triggers an emergency mode where the system is brought to runlevel 1 (multi-user text mode), and essential services are started to provide a minimal environment for troubleshooting issues. This can be helpful when dealing with system problems that prevent regular login or access to the graphical interface. Once the issue has been addressed, you can use `systemctl` commands like `reboot`, `halt`, or exit rescue mode to bring the system back to its normal state.'
