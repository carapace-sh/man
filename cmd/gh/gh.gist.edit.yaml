    command: '[AI] The `gh` command with the option `gist edit` is used to create or update a new GitHub Gist. This command allows users to open a text editor directly in their terminal and make modifications to a file, then push those changes back to the associated Gist on GitHub without having to visit the website. Once the editing is complete, the user saves the changes and GitHub updates the Gist with the new content.'

        add: '[AI] `gh` is a GitHub CLI tool. The command `gh gist edit --add` is used to create or update a new GitHub Gist with existing files in your local directory. The `--add` flag indicates that the specified files should be added to the Gist but not committed yet, allowing you to stage and modify files before committing the changes.'
        desc: '[AI] The command `gh auth login` is used to authenticate with GitHub''s OAuth API, while `gh gist create` creates a new GitHub Gist.

        filename: '[AI] The command `gh edit --filename` is used with the GitHub client (Gh) to open a file in your default text editor or IDE, and make changes locally.
