    command: '[AI] The `dlv completion fish` command is used to install the Fish completions for Delve debugger in the Fish shell. Delve is a popular Go source code debugger, and Fish completions enhance the user experience by providing suggestions as you type in the command-line interface. This command typically needs to be run once the Fish configuration is set up, and it adds functionality for auto-completing Delve-related commands and arguments within the Fish shell.'
    flag:
        no-descriptions: '[AI] The command `dlv completion fish --no-descriptions` is related to the Delve debugger (dlv) and the Fish Shell. It requests for auto-completion suggestions from Delve without displaying descriptions or tooltips along with them. This can lead to a more streamlined experience for users who prefer a minimal interface while debugging.'
