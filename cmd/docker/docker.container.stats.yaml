name: stats [OPTIONS] [CONTAINER...]
description: Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics
flags:
    --format=: 'Format output using a custom template:'
    --no-stream: Disable streaming stats and only pull the first result
    --no-trunc: Do not truncate output
    -a, --all: Show all containers (default shows just running)
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker container stats` is a command used to display the resource usage statistics (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.) of running Docker containers. It provides real-time or near real-time data, helping users understand the container''s resource consumption and identify potential performance issues. The output includes container ID or name, usage percentages for CPU and memory, and read/write statistics for network I/O and disk I/O.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `docker container stats --all` is a command used in Docker to display resource usage statistics (CPU, memory, network I/O, etc.) for all running containers. The `--all` option includes statistics for both the container and its underlying host system. This can help users understand the resource consumption of their Docker containers and identify potential performance bottlenecks or optimization opportunities.'
        format: '[AI] `docker container stats --format` is a command used in Docker to display real-time, detailed resource usage statistics (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.) for one or more running containers. The `--format` option allows customizing the output format using Go template syntax. This can be useful for automating analysis and monitoring tasks. Without this flag, the command would return a JSON formatted output by default.'
        no-stream: '[AI] `docker container stats --no-stream` is a command used in Docker to display real-time, detailed statistics about one or more running containers. The `--no-stream` option is used to disable live streaming output and instead, display the statistics as a JSON array in the console at a given instant. This can be useful when you want to store or analyze the data in scripts or other tools.'
        no-trunc: '[AI] `docker container stats --no-trunc` is a command used in Docker to display real-time, detailed statistics of running containers. The `--no-trunc` option prevents the output from being truncated and instead displays all available statistics columns without abbreviation. This provides a more comprehensive view into the resource usage and performance metrics of the container.'
