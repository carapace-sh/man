    command: '[AI] The `terraform providers lock` command is used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, to ensure that the versions of Terraform providers being used in a project are pinned down and won''t change during execution. By running this command, Terraform will write a file named `terraform.lock.hcl` with the exact version information of all providers specified in your `provider.tf` files. This locked file can be committed to source control, ensuring consistency across team members or environments.'
    flag:
        fs-mirror: '[AI] The `terraform providers lock --fs-mirror` command is used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, to lock the versions of provider binaries that are being used in a project and create a local mirror of their file storage locations (called "file service" or "fs" mirrors). This ensures consistency and reproducibility of the state across different runs of Terraform by preventing automatic updates of providers during the execution. The `--fs-mirror` flag instructs Terraform to create or update the local fs mirror after locking the provider versions.'
        net-mirror: '[AI] The `terraform providers lock --net-mirror` command is used in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, to download and install specific versions of Terraform providers from a self-hosted mirror instead of the public registry. This command ensures that only the desired provider versions are installed, maintaining consistency across different Terraform workspaces or teams. It helps in managing dependencies, reducing potential conflicts, and improving security by using an internal network mirror.'
        platform: |-
            [AI] The `terraform providers lock -platform` command is used to lock the versions of Terraform providers to specific platforms in your Terraform configuration. This means that when you run `terraform apply`, Terraform will ensure that it uses the exact versions of providers that have been tested and confirmed to work on the specified platform (e.g., "linux\_x86\_64" or "windows\_amd64").

            By locking providers to specific platforms, you can help avoid potential compatibility issues between Terraform, your configuration, and the underlying infrastructure providers. This command is executed using the Terraform CLI and typically appears as part of a `.terraformrc` file or in a custom Terraform script.
