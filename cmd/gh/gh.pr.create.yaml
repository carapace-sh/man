documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh pr create` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new pull request from the current branch to a specified branch in a repository. It requires authentication and must be run from the local repository''s root directory. The syntax is `gh pr create <base-branch> <head-branch> [--title "<commit-message>"]`. This will open a web browser for you to review changes before submitting the pull request, or you can use `--no-open` flag to bypass this step and submit directly.'
    flag:
        assignee: '[AI] `gh pr create --assignee` is a command used in GitHub''s `git-hub` CLI tool to create a new pull request. The `--assignee` option assigns a specific user as the initial assignee for the pull request. This can be useful for assigning work to team members or developers, facilitating collaboration and code review.'
        base: '[AI] The `gh pr create` command is used to create a new pull request in GitHub, and the `--base` option specifies the branch that should be used as the base for the new pull request. In other words, it determines which branch will serve as the starting point for the changes being proposed in the pull request. By default, the base branch is usually the main or master branch. However, you can specify a different branch using the `--base` flag.'
        body: '[AI] `gh pr create --body` is a command used in GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, called `gh`, to create a new pull request. The `--body` option is used to specify the body text of the pull request description. This text can include any relevant information about the changes made in the pull request, such as a summary of the changes, instructions for reviewers, or links to related issues.'
        body-file: '[AI] `gh pr create --body-file` is a command used in the GitHub CLI (gh) to create a new pull request. The `--body-file` option specifies a file containing the description or body text for the pull request. This can be useful when creating a pull request with a detailed explanation of the changes, while keeping the command line interface simple.'
        draft: '[AI] `gh pr create --draft` is a GitHub CLI command used to create a new draft pull request. A draft pull request is an incomplete pull request that can be saved as a work-in-progress and later updated before being submitted for review. This command creates a new draft pull request based on the current branch or committed changes, but does not merge the changes into the target branch or trigger any workflows or reviews yet. It allows developers to prepare and refine their changes before making them visible to collaborators.'
        fill: '[AI] `gh pr create --fill` is a command used in the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, `gh`. This command creates a new pull request between two branches with the specified heads, filling in the body and title fields based on the branch descriptions by default. The `--fill` flag enables this feature to automatically generate a pull request description and title from the source and target branches'' commit messages.'
        fill-first: '[AI] The `gh pr create --fill-first` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new pull request with pre-populated files. The `--fill-first` flag indicates that the first file in the list of changes provided should be filled with content before creating the pull request. This can be useful when creating a pull request from a template or a starter file, allowing you to modify the content before submitting it for review.'
        fill-verbose: '[AI] `gh pr create` is a command used in GitHub''s command-line interface (CLI) tool, `gh`. This command creates a new pull request. The `--fill-verbose` option is used to provide more detailed information while creating the pull request. It automatically sets various fields like title, description, and base branch based on the current branch and active editor, providing a clearer view of the changes being made in the pull request.'
        head: '[AI] `gh pr create --head` is a command used in GitHub''s `gh` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. This command creates a new pull request on GitHub with the current branch as the head of one branch and another specified branch as the base. In other words, it opens a pull request merging the changes from the current branch into the specified branch.'
        label: '[AI] The `gh pr create` command is used to create a new pull request in GitHub from the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface). The `--label` option sets a custom label for the pull request. Labels help categorize and prioritize issues and pull requests. This allows team members to filter and manage them more effectively.'
        milestone: '[AI] The `gh pr create --milestone` command is used with the GitHub CLI (gh) to create a new pull request (PR) and associate it with a specific milestone. When creating a new PR using this command, you''ll need to provide a branch base and a head branch as arguments. Additionally, you can specify the milestone number or name using the `--milestone` flag. This helps organize your work in progress and keep track of which tasks belong to which release or version update in your project.'
        no-maintainer-edit: '[AI] The `git hub pr create --no-maintainer-edit` command is used to create a pull request (PR) on GitHub without allowing the project maintainers to automatically make changes to the branch in the PR before it''s merged. This option can be useful when you want to ensure that only your proposed changes are incorporated into the project, maintaining fine-grained control over the merge process. It''s typically used for critical or sensitive updates and helps preserve the project''s integrity by reducing the chances of unintended modifications.'
        project: '[AI] The `gh pr create` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new pull request in a GitHub repository. The `--project` option specifies which project or repository you want to create the pull request against. This option takes the name of the project or repository as an argument, typically in the format of `<username>/<repository>`. For example, `gh pr create --project myusername/myprepo` would create a new pull request for the `myprepo` repository owned by the user `myusername`.'
        recover: '[AI] The `gh pr create --recover` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new pull request from an existing branch or commit in your local repository, using the changes that were previously discarded during a failed or aborted pull request creation attempt. It retrieves the differences between the head branch and the target branch at the time of the failure, allowing you to recover those changes for a new pull request submission.'
        reviewer: '[AI] The `gh pr create --reviewer` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new Pull Request with specified reviewers. When creating a new branch and opening a Pull Request, you can use this command followed by the email addresses or usernames of desired reviewers as arguments to request their review of your changes. This helps ensure that your code changes undergo careful scrutiny before being merged into the main branch.'
        template: '[AI] The `gh pr create --template` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new pull request with a specified template. This template can be a Dockerfile, a YAML file, or any other custom file that follows the naming convention `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` in your repository. The created PR will include this pre-populated content when opened for review and collaboration.'
        title: '[AI] `gh pr create` is a GitHub CLI command used to create a new pull request. The `--title` option sets the title for the pull request. It specifies the brief description summarizing the changes in the pull request.'
        web: '[AI] The `gh pr create --web` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new pull request from a web URL in your terminal or command line interface. This command allows you to easily open a new pull request with a single command, without having to navigate to the GitHub website and manually create one. The `--web` flag is specific to providing the URL of the branch or repository that contains the changes you wish to incorporate into the pull request.'
