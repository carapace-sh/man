documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint config source-set` command in Waypoint, an open-source multi-cloud infrastructure automation platform, is used to modify the configuration sources for a specific module or set of modules. With this command, you can update which files or repositories are being referenced for the configuration data of your Waypoint-managed resources. This can be useful when making changes to your infrastructure definitions or implementing new configurations from different sources.'
    flag:
        app: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint config source-set --app` command in Waypoint, an open-source multi-cloud infrastructure automation tool by Google, is used to set the configuration sources for a specific application. This sets the location where Waypoint will retrieve the configuration data for that particular application.

            In simpler terms, this command tells Waypoint to update the configuration sources for the specified application from the given location, allowing you to easily manage and modify your infrastructure configurations.
        config: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint config source-set --config` command in Waypoint is used to set a specific configuration file as the active configuration for a given set of modules or services. Waypoint is an open-source infrastructure automation tool that allows managing multiple configurations for the same set of resources, enabling easy switching between different environments (staging, production, etc.) or versions of configurations.

            With this command, you can update the current active configuration set by specifying a new configuration file, which could be either local or remote. The `--config` flag indicates that you are providing the path to the desired configuration file. This command is useful when you need to apply different sets of configuration parameters to your resources based on the environment or other conditions.
        delete: '[AI] `waypoint config source-set --delete` is a command used in Google''s Waypoint configuration management tool. This command deletes a specific configuration source set from Waypoint''s knowledge. Source sets define where Waypoint looks for configuration files or modules. By using `--delete`, the specified source set will be removed, affecting how Waypoint locates and applies configurations during subsequent deployments.'
        plain: |-
            [AI] `waypoint` is an open-source infrastructure configuration management tool. The command `waypoint config source-set --plain` is used to set the configuration sources for a Waypoint application, specifically setting them in plain text format.

            The `config` subcommand is used to manage and modify configuration data for applications. The `source-set` command is used to specify which configuration sources (i.e., where the configuration data is stored) should be used. The `--plain` flag indicates that the configuration sources should be provided in plain text format rather than using other source types like HCL files or environment variables.

            So, this command sets the configuration sources for a Waypoint application to be plain text values provided on the command line or in a file.
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint config source-set --project` command in Waypoint configuration management tool is used to set or update the configuration sources for a specific project. The sources can be local directories, remote URLs, or other Waypoint projects, and this command allows you to specify which ones should be applied to the given project. This helps in managing multiple configuration sources and keeping your infrastructure definitions up-to-date.'
        type: '[AI] The `waypoint config source-set --type` command in Waypoint, an open-source multi-cloud infrastructure automation tool, is used to set a specific configuration source for a given type. The `source-set` subcommand modifies the configuration sources that Waypoint uses to read and apply templates during its execution. The `--type` flag specifies the type of the resource or module whose configuration source is being modified. For example, `--type network` could be used to set a network-specific configuration source, such as a file or a Git repository. This command sets the specified configuration source for the given type in Waypoint''s configuration.'
        workspace: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint config source-set --workspace` command is used in Google Cloud's open-source infrastructure automation tool, Waypoint. This command sets the configuration sources for a specific Waypoint workspace.

            Configuration sources define where Waypoint should look to find the configuration files that define the desired state of your infrastructure. By using `--workspace`, you specify which Waypoint workspace to modify. The `source-set` subcommand then allows you to add or remove configuration sources from that workspace.

            For example, `waypoint config source-set my_workspace --add git+ssh://example.com/path/to/configs` would add a new Git repository as a configuration source for the "my\_workspace" Waypoint workspace.
