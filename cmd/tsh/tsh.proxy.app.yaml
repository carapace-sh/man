    command: '[AI] The `tsh proxy app` command is used in Tenable''s SecurityCenter Continuous View (CV) platform with Nessus and Log Correlation Engine (LCE) agents deployed. This command starts or manages the Tenable Proxy application, which acts as an intermediary between Nessus and LCE for data transfer and communication. It enables scanning of hosts that are not directly accessible from the Nessus console but can be reached by the proxy. The command typically comes with various options for controlling the proxy behavior, such as specifying a port number or configuring authentication.'
    flag:
        port: '[AI] The `--port` option in the `tssh proxy app` command is used to specify the port number on which the Tssh proxy server will listen for incoming SSH connections. This allows users to connect to remote servers through the Tssh proxy, adding an extra layer of security or simplifying access to restricted networks.'
