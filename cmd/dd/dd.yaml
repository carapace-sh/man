    command: '[AI] `dd` is a versatile command-line utility in Unix and Linux systems used for copying and converting files. It can read from an input source, process the data according to specified options, and write the output to a file or another location. Its name stands for "data description," reflecting its primary function. With `dd`, users can perform tasks such as cloning disks, creating backups, or converting file formats using various options. The syntax is typically `dd [options] if=[input-file] of=[output-file] bs=[block-size]`.'

            [AI] `dd` is a versatile command-line utility in Unix-based systems used for copying and converting files. Its name stands for Data Description. The `--help` option, when used with `dd`, displays detailed usage information about the command, including valid options, their meanings, and examples. For instance:

            ```sh
            dd --help
            ```

            Output:

            ```txt
            Usage: dd [OPTION]... if=INPUT_FILE of=OUTPUT_FILE bs=BLOCK_SIZE count=COUNT \
                    conv=CONVERSION_SPEED skip=SKIP_COUNT [REPEAT_COUNT] iflag=FLAG_VALUE...

            Copy files, converting and optionally encrypting as needed.

            Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
              -b, --byte      use 512-byte blocks (default is 512)
              -B, --unblock-aligment=SIZE align input and output by SIZE
                             (default is block size)
              --size=SIZE     read and write only SIZE bytes per iteration

            Input and Output files:
              -i, --input=FILE  specify an input file name
              -F, --force      force the output file to be created even if it already exists
              -N, --no-overwrite-dest  don't overwrite the output file
              -T, --testing     perform only test run (no actual copying or modification)
                               of input and output files

            Block size and conversion:
              -c, --count=COUNT  read and write COUNT blocks
              -conv=CONV_SPEED   enable conversion options:
                                   s, swab, a (ASCII only), e (ascii_out), noerror
                                   u (unsigned chars), m (mac binary), p (planar), r (reversed bytes)
              --record-prefix=PREFIX
                                   print RECORD_PREFIX at the start of each record

            Data selection:
              -skip=SKIP_COUNT  skip SKIP_COUNT records at the beginning
              --seek=POS        set input offset to POS before reading
              iflag=FLAG_VALUE enable custom I/O flags (e.g., direct, sync, etc.)
            ```

            This help text explains how to use the `dd` command with various options and their meanings.
        version: '[AI] The `dd` command with the `--version` option is used to display the version information of the `dd` data definition and copy tool in Unix-like operating systems. When you run the command `dd --version`, it will output a line containing the `dd` utility version number, compilation datestamp, operating system name, and other relevant details. This helps users check which version of `dd` they have installed, ensuring compatibility with specific use cases or troubleshooting issues.'
