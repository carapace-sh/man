documentation:
    command: '[AI] `modinfo` is a Linux command used to display information about installed kernel modules. When you run this command followed by the name of a module, it shows detailed information about that specific module such as its description, version, author, and dependencies. This command provides valuable insights for system administrators and developers who need to manage or troubleshoot Linux kernel modules.'
    flag:
        author: '[AI] The `modinfo` command is a utility in Linux for displaying information about loaded kernel modules. The `--author` option is used to display the author or maintainer of the specified module. It provides information about who wrote or maintained the code within the module.'
        basedir: '[AI] The `modinfo` command is a utility in Linux for displaying information about loaded kernel modules. The `--basedir` option specifies the base directory of the kernel source tree, which is used to resolve relative paths within module files for functions like `makehelp`. It doesn''t directly provide any specific module information but is useful for building and understanding the relationship between kernel sources and loaded modules.'
        description: '[AI] `modinfo --description` is a Linux command used to display the description or long comment of a kernel module. When you run this command followed by the name of a module, it will output the text that was provided when the module was compiled, typically containing a brief explanation of what the module does.'
        field: '[AI] The `modinfo --field` command is a Linux kernel utility used to display information about Linux kernel modules. The `--field` option is used with this command to specify the name of a specific field within the module data that should be displayed. For example, `modinfo --field dependents <module_name>` would show the list of modules that the specified module depends on. It helps in understanding the relationships and requirements between kernel modules.'
        filename: '[AI] The `modinfo` command is a utility in Linux for displaying information about kernel modules. The `--filename` option is used to display the filename of the specified module, along with its source and other related information. For example, `modinfo --filename mymodule.ko` will output something like `filename: /lib/modules/5.4.0-63/kernel/drivers/net/mymodule.ko`.'
        help: '[AI] `modinfo --help` is a command used in Linux to display help information about the usage and available options for the `modinfo` utility. This tool is employed to retrieve and display detailed information about Linux kernel modules, such as their dependencies, version, description, author, and more. By invoking `modinfo --help`, you will be presented with a clear explanation of how to effectively use this command with various options for querying specific module data.'
        license: '[AI] The `modinfo` command is a utility in Linux for displaying information about installed kernel modules. The `--license` option is used to display the license terms associated with the given module. It provides information on the specific permissions granted or restricted by the chosen license. This can include details such as open source, proprietary, or restrictive permissions, and can help determine if a particular module complies with your organization''s software usage policies.'
        "null": '[AI] The `modinfo` command is a utility in Linux for displaying information about installed kernel modules. The option `--null` changes the output format of the command to separate each field with a null character instead of whitespace, making it easier to parse the output programmatically.'
        parameters: '[AI] `modinfo --parameters` is a command used in Linux to display detailed information about a kernel module. The "--parameters" option specifically displays the name and value of each module parameter. These parameters allow users to configure various aspects of the module at load time. Understanding the available parameters can be useful for troubleshooting, optimization, or customizing the behavior of the module.'
        set-version: '[AI] `modinfo --set-version` is a command used in Linux kernel module development. It sets or updates the version information of a kernel module using the modinfo utility. The syntax is `modinfo --set-version <module_name> <version>`. This command is particularly useful when making changes to the module''s metadata without recompiling and relocating the entire module.'
        version: '[AI] `modinfo --version` is a command used in the Linux kernel module loading system to display the version information of the `modinfo` utility itself. It helps users verify they are using an up-to-date and functioning version of the tool. This command does not provide any information about specific modules, only the version details related to modinfo itself.'
