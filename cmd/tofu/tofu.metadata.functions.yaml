        [AI] Tofu is a R package for data exploration and manipulation in R. Metadata functions are a set of built-in Tofu functions that provide information about data frames, including:

        1. `tld(x)`: Shows the first few rows of a data frame or data mask, depending on the context.
        2. `tlc(x, n = 5)`: Displays the structure and summary statistics of an object, showing the number of rows, columns, types, missing values, and data classes.
        3. `tlv(x, var_name = NULL)`: Shows variable level information, such as variable names, their types, and missing value counts.
        4. `tla(x)`: Provides a more detailed summary of each column, including statistics, unique values, and data types.
        5. `tlc_all(x)`: Displays a comprehensive summary of all columns in a data frame.

        These functions help to quickly understand the nature and content of a dataset while working with R and Tofu.
