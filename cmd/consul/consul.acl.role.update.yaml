    command: |-
        [AI] `consul acl role update` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul to modify the access control list (ACL) roles within the service. This command allows you to update the permissions and capabilities of existing roles.

        The basic usage is: `consul acl role update <role-name> [<flags>]`, where `<role-name>` specifies the name of the ACL role to be updated, and `[<flags>]` (optional) includes various flags that can modify specific aspects of the role such as policies, capabilities, or tags.

        For example: `consul acl role update my_role -policy=read -tag-name=env:production`. This command updates the 'my_role' ACL role with a new policy (read) and adds the tag 'env:production'.
    flag:
        ca-file: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl role update` command is used to modify the Access Control List (ACL) roles in Hashicorp's Consul service, which is a popular service mesh and configuration management tool. The `--ca-file` option is related to the use of TLS certificates for secure communication between Consul servers and clients.

            When you run the command with `--ca-file`, you are providing Consul with a file that contains a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate, which it will trust when communicating with the client or server whose role you're updating. The CA certificate in this file is used to validate their identity and ensure data integrity during the role update process.

            For example: `consul acl role update <role-name> --policy=<policy-file> --ca-file=/path/to/your_ca_certificate.pem`.

            This command will update the given role's policy with the policy file you provide, and it will only proceed if it trusts the provided CA certificate.
        ca-path: '[AI] `consul acl role update` is a command provided by Hashicorp''s Consul data center and service mesh platform for managing Access Control Lists (ACL). The `--ca-path` flag specifies the path to a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file when updating an ACL role that uses TLS client authentication. By providing this certificate, Consul ensures the authenticity of the clients trying to assume the updated role. This is an essential security measure for controlling who can access your Consul services or infrastructure through the use of roles and permissions.'
        client-cert: '[AI] The `consul acl role update` command is used to modify the Access Control List (ACL) roles in Consul, a Connectivity and Service Discovery tool by Hashicorp. The `--client-cert` flag is an optional argument provided with this command, which specifies that the request should be signed using a TLS client certificate. This adds an additional layer of security to the API request by requiring the client to present a valid certificate for authentication and authorization purposes.'
        client-key: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl role update` command is used to modify the Access Control List (ACL) roles in Consul, a Connectivity and Service Discovery tool by Hashicorp. Specifically, the `--client-key` option is provided to identify the client making the API request with its unique key.

            With this flag, you can perform ACL role updates securely by requiring that the client making the request has the correct authorization, thereby enhancing security in your Consul deployment. The `consul` CLI tool checks the client's key to ensure it meets the required access control policies before executing the role update command.
        datacenter: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl role update --datacenter` command is used to update the Access Control List (ACL) roles in Hashicorp Consul, a distributed, highly available, and data center aware toolkit for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration.

            This command allows you to modify the permissions of ACL roles across multiple datacenters. By default, Consul is single-datacenter, but with the datacenter feature enabled, it can manage multiple datacenters as a single cluster. This command enables you to manage access control policies consistently across those datacenters.

            The `--role` option specifies the name of the role that will be updated, and the new permissions for this role are defined using a JSON file or inline with the command. The `--datacenter` option is used to specify which datacenter(s) the role update should apply to. This can be a single datacenter name or a list of multiple datacenter names.
        description: '[AI] The `consul acl role update` command is used to modify the description of an Access Control List (ACL) role in Consul, a popular service discovery and configuration management tool. The `--description` flag allows you to specify a new description for the role when updating it. This helps keep track of roles'' intended use within your Consul infrastructure.'
        format: '[AI] `consul acl role update --format` is a command used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery and configuration management. This command allows updating the Access Control List (ACL) role definitions in Consul with new or modified policies. The `--format` option determines the output format of the updated roles. By default, the output is JSON, but other formats like HCL or Tabular can be chosen to suit different use cases. The effect is that the command will update the roles and return the results according to the selected format, enabling easy integration with other tools or scripts.'
        http-addr: '[AI] The `consul acl role update --http-addr` command is used to update the HTTP address for a specific Access Control List (ACL) role in Consul, an open-source service discovery, configuration, and orchestration tool. With this command, you can modify the IP address or domain name that the selected ACL role uses to access Consul''s HTTP API. This can be useful when making changes to your network infrastructure or when securing your Consul environment by updating the access control for sensitive APIs.'
        id: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl role update --id` command is used to update the access control list (ACL) role in Consul, which is a connective tissue for security and policy within the service discovery and configuration management platform.

            This command allows you to specify a new ACL role definition with an ID, which will replace the existing role with that ID. The updated role definition can include changes to the permissions granted to different entities (e.g., teams, members) under various scopes (e.g., services, keys, nodes).

            In summary, this command is essential when you need to modify an existing ACL role in your Consul environment, ensuring that access control policies are up-to-date and aligned with your evolving organizational needs.
        meta: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl role update --meta` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. It updates the metadata associated with an Access Control List (ACL) role.

            The syntax of the command is as follows:

            ```bash
            consul acl role update [NAME] --meta KEY=VALUE ...
            ```

            Replace `[NAME]` with the name of the ACL role you want to update, and `KEY=VALUE` are the key-value pairs you wish to add or modify in the role's metadata. This command is particularly useful when you need to set or change custom properties for your roles, providing more fine-grained control over access in your Consul environment.
        name: '[AI] The `consul acl role update` command is used in the Consul access control list (ACL) system to modify the attributes of an existing role with name specified by `--name`. The changes can include adding or removing permissions for different resources, such as keys, services, or nodes. This command helps in managing and configuring fine-grained access controls within a Consul environment.'
        namespace: '[AI] The `consul acl role update` command is used to modify the Access Control List (ACL) roles in Consul, a Connect andConfig management plane. The `--namespace` flag specifies which namespace the operation should be applied to. Consul uses namespaces for logical isolation of resources within a cluster. By providing a namespace with this command, you are updating the role definition only for the specified namespace.'
        no-merge: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl role update` command is used in Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This specific command is used to update the Access Control List (ACL) roles within Consul's security model.

            The option `--no-merge` tells Consul not to merge changes with any existing roles that may have the same name. Instead, it replaces the entire role with the new configuration provided. This can be useful when you want to completely overwrite an existing role rather than making incremental updates to it.

            In summary, `consul acl role update --no-merge` is used to update or replace (without merging) ACL roles in Consul, providing you with more control over the configuration of those roles.
        node-identity: '[AI] The `consul acl role update --node-identity` command is used in Hashicorp Consul to update the Access Control List (ACL) role for a specific node identity. This command allows you to modify the permissions and access control rules assigned to that particular node in the Consul service mesh or key-value store. By using `--node-identity`, you can precisely target which node''s ACL role you want to update, ensuring a fine-grained approach to managing access and security within your Consul environment.'
        policy-id: '[AI] The `consul acl role update` command is used to modify the access control policy (ACL) for a specific role in the Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. The `--policy-id` flag specifies the ID of the existing ACL policy that will be updated with new permissions or modifications. By using this command, an administrator can fine-grain the access control settings for different roles within their Consul environment.'
        policy-name: '[AI] The `consul acl role update` command is used in Hashicorp Consul to modify the access control policy (ACL) associated with a specific role. The `--policy-name` flag specifies the name of the new policy that will be assigned to the role. Once this command is executed, the role will have the updated ACL permissions defined within the named policy.'
        service-identity: |-
            [AI] The `consul acl role update --service-identity` command in Hashicorp Consul is used to update the Access Control List (ACL) role of a service identity. Service identities represent applications or services that are registered and authenticated with Consul's Service Catalog.

            With this command, you can modify the permissions granted to a specific service identity. The ACL roles define what actions an entity can perform on different resources within Consul. For example, you could grant a role "read-only" access to a certain key or give it "write" access to another key.

            By using `--service-identity`, you specify the name of the service identity whose ACL role will be updated. The command accepts JSON input for defining the new ACL policy, allowing you to add, modify, or remove permissions as needed.
        stale: |-
            [AI] `consul acl role update --stale` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This specific command is used to update the Access Control List (ACL) roles with stale policies.

            Stale policies refer to policies that have been updated in the backend data store but not yet propagated to all Consul servers and clients. By using `--stale`, you force Consul to apply the new role definition even if there are inconsistencies between servers, potentially causing conflicts or temporary disruptions to services.

            The primary use case for this command is when updating roles that cannot afford downtime during the propagation process. It allows you to apply changes immediately while accepting the risks associated with potential inconsistencies in the system.
        tls-server-name: '[AI] The `consul acl role update --tls-server-name` command is used to update an Access Control List (ACL) role definition in Consul, a popular service discovery and configuration management tool. This specific command is used to update the TLS server name for that role''s HTTP or gRPC transport credentials. The `--tls-server-name` flag accepts a string value representing the name of the TLS certificate to trust when connecting to an encrypted Consul HTTP or gRPC API server. This helps ensure secure communication between Consul agents and servers by requiring clients to present valid SSL/TLS certificates during communication.'
        token: '[AI] The `consul acl role update` command is used to update the Access Control List (ACL) roles in Consul, a connectivity and configuration management tool. The `--token` option is for providing an authentication token to authenticate and authorize the request. This token should have sufficient permissions to modify ACL roles within Consul. When used together, this command updates the specified ACL role with the new settings while ensuring that only authorized requests are processed.'
        token-file: '[AI] The `consul acl role update` command is used to update the access control list (ACL) roles in Consul, an open-source networking and service discovery tool. The `--token-file` option specifies the file path to a token which grants permissions to execute this operation. This token must have appropriate privileges to modify ACL roles within the Consul data center. Without this option, you would need to provide the token as a command-line argument instead of using a file.'
