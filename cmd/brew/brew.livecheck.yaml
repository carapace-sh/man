This can help you keep your software up-to-date.'
    flag:
        cask: '[AI] `brew livecheck --cask` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command initiates a check for updates to installed Cask (third-party) applications managed by Homebrew.

It''s a convenient way to keep your system updated with the latest versions of your chosen software.'
        debug: '[AI] `brew livecheck --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS.

        formula: '[AI] `brew livecheck --formula` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command initiates a check for available updates or new versions of specific Homebrew formulae (packages) installed on your system. By specifying the `--formula` option followed by the formula name, you can limit the live check to only that particular formula instead of checking all installed packages. The output will display the current version and the available version if an update exists.'
        full-name: '[AI] `brew livecheck --full-name` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command checks for available updates to Homebrew''s formulae (packages) and their dependencies, showing the full names of those that have an updated formula in the terminal output.
