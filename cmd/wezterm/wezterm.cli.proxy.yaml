    command: '[AI] The `wezterm cli proxy` is not a standard WezTerm command, but rather a feature that allows WezTerm to act as an SSH proxy server from its Command Line Interface (CLI). With this functionality, you can forward local and remote ports, set environment variables, and customize the proxy''s configuration in various ways. This can be useful when setting up complex SSH connections or automating workflows that involve multiple machines. To use it, run WezTerm with the `--proxy` flag followed by an optional configuration file containing your desired settings. For more information, refer to the WezTerm documentation.'

            [AI] `wezterm cli proxy --help` is a command used with WezTerm, a modern terminal emulator for Unix and Windows. The `cli proxy` subcommand enables WezTerm to act as an SSH gateway or proxy. This allows users to connect to remote servers through WezTerm, which can forward specific ports, X11 connections, or other resources.

            The `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use the `cli proxy` command, including usage examples and available options for customizing the proxy behavior.
