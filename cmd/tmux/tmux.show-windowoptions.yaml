    command: '[AI] The `tmux show-window-options` command in TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) is used to display the current window option settings in the terminal pane. It provides a quick way to check and modify the configuration of an open window, such as setting the active pane or adjusting layouts. The output shows key bindings and other options for the selected window.'
    flag:
        g: '[AI] The `tmux show-window-options -g` command in Tmux is used to display the current window option settings in a global format across all windows. The `-g` flag indicates that the output should be shown globally, meaning it will apply to all windows rather than just the current one. This can be helpful for quickly reviewing or comparing the configuration of multiple windows within a Tmux session.'
        t: '[AI] `tmux show-window-options` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer that displays the current window option settings for the specified window. The `-t` option specifies the target window by its identifier (number or name). For example, `tmux show-window-options -t 0.1` would display the options for the first sub-window of the first window in the current session. This command can be useful for inspecting and modifying window settings within Tmux sessions.'
        v: '[AI] `tmux show-window-options -v` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer to display the current window option settings in a verbose format. It allows users to view the configuration of their current window, including the status bar mode, synchronize mode, and other options related to window behavior. This command can be helpful for troubleshooting or understanding the current state of your Tmux windows.'
