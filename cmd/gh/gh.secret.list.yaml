    command: '[AI] `gh secret list` is a command used in GitHub''s CLI (git-hub) tool to display a list of all defined secrets in your GitHub repository or organization.

    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `gh secret list --app` command is used with GitHub''s `git-hub` CLI tool to list all the secrets associated with a specific GitHub App. The `--app` argument specifies the name or ID of the target GitHub App. This command helps you manage and keep track of secrets, such as API keys, access tokens, and other sensitive information, that are used by your GitHub apps.'
        env: '[AI] `gh secret list --env` is a command used with the GitHub CLI (gh) tool to list all environment variables stored in GitHub Secrets. The `--env` flag filters the output to only display the names and values of the environment variables.'
        jq: '[AI] `gh secret list` is a command from the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, which lists all the secrets stored in your GitHub account or a specific organization or repository. The `--jq` flag is used to apply JSON queries with the JQ processor, enabling you to filter and manipulate the output of the command in various ways, making it easier to extract required information from the raw JSON response.'
        json: '[AI] `gh secret list --json` is a command used with the GitHub CLI (gh) tool. It lists all the stored secrets in your GitHub account or a specific repository, and returns the output in JSON format. This command allows you to programmatically access and manage secrets as data, facilitating automation and integration with other tools.'
        org: '[AI] The `gh secret list --org` command is a part of the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, specifically the `gh secrets` sub-command. It is used to list all the secrets stored for a given organization in GitHub''s encrypted Secrets Manager. The flag `--org` specifies the organization name. This command allows users to easily manage and view their organization''s encrypted secrets from the command line, helping to maintain security and access control over sensitive information.'
        template: '[AI] `gh secret list --template` is a command used with the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, gh. This command lists all the secrets stored in your GitHub account or organization, but with an added feature: it applies a custom template to output the results in a desired format. The template is used to define how the data should be displayed, such as in JSON, YAML or plain text format.'
        user: '[AI] `gh secret list` is a command used with GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, `git-hub`. The `--user` option specifies that the command should be run under the context of a specific GitHub user''s authentication instead of the default system or current directory one. This means that any secrets managed by this user will be displayed when using this command.'
