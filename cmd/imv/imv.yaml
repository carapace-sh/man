documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `imv` command is not a standard Unix or Linux command. It might be specific to certain image processing software or file systems, depending on the context in which it''s used. Without more context, it''s impossible to provide an accurate explanation. However, in general terms, commands that begin with ''imv'' could potentially relate to image manipulation tasks. For instance, ImageMagick is a popular software suite for creating, editing and converting bitmap images that uses `imv` as a command-line tool to invoke its various image processing features. If you''re unsure about the specific meaning of this command in your context, it''s recommended to consult the relevant documentation or help resources provided by the software or system you''re using.'
    flag:
        b: '[AI] The `imv` command with the option `-b` is used in ImageMagick, a software suite for creating and editing raster graphics. The `-b` flag specifies that the output image should have a certain number of bits per pixel (color depth). For example, using `-b 8` would create an output image with 8 bits per pixel, supporting up to 256 distinct colors. Other common bit depths include 1 bit (binary images), 16 bits, and 24 bits for true color images.'
        c: '[AI] The `imv` command with the option `-c` is used in ImageMagick, a software suite to create, edit and convert bitmap images. The `-c` option stands for "compare" and instructs ImageMagick to perform a visual or statistical comparison of two images and display the differences between them. This can be useful for checking changes made to an image or verifying that two images are identical.'
        d: '[AI] The `imv` command with the option `-d` is a part of the `imagemagick` software suite. This option stands for "delete" and is used to delete files or images that do not match the specified criteria after the image manipulation operations have been applied. For example, if you use `imv *.jpg -resize 100x100 -d *.png`, it will resize all JPG files and delete any PNG files that were not affected by the command. This can be useful for automating image processing tasks and cleaning up unused files.'
        f: '[AI] The `imv` command with the `-f` option is used in Unix-like operating systems, specifically the `imagemagick` software suite. The `-f` flag stands for "force" and is used to overwrite existing output files without asking for confirmation. It''s helpful when you are automating image processing tasks and want to avoid interruptions due to prompting for file overwrite confirmation.'
        h: '[AI] The `imv` command with the option `-h` displays help information. This means that when you type `imv -h` in a terminal, Imagemagick''s image manipulation program will provide a brief explanation of its usage, options, and available commands.'
        l: '[AI] The `imv` command with the option `-l` is used in Unix-based systems for renaming files or directories using a template. The `-l` flag stands for "symbolic links" and tells the command to follow any symbolic links when processing the file names. This means that if the specified file is a symbolic link, `imv` will rename the linked file instead of the symbolic link itself.'
        "n": '[AI] The `imv` command with the option `-n` is a Unix utility for renaming files or directories. The `-n` flag stands for "no clobber," which means that if a file or directory with the new name already exists in the destination directory, the operation will not overwrite it. Instead, an error message will be displayed, and the command will stop executing. This option is useful to prevent accidental data loss due to overwriting existing files.'
        r: '[AI] The `imv` command with the option `-r` in Unix-based systems is used for renaming multiple files. The `-r` stands for "recursive," meaning this option applies to directories as well as individual files. When you use `imv -r <source> <destination>`, it renames all files and subdirectories within the source directory (specified by `<source>`) to the corresponding locations in the destination directory (specified by `<destination>`).'
        s: '[AI] The `imv` command with the `-s` option is a Unix utility for renaming files or directories. The `-s` flag stands for "symbolic" and indicates that the renames are to be performed symbolically, i.e., creating new names as links to existing files or directories instead of physically moving or copying them. This can be useful when dealing with large files or directories that might take a long time to move or copy, or when you want to keep multiple hard links to the same data.'
        t: '[AI] The `imv` command with the `-t` option is used to rename multiple files in Unix-based systems. The `-t` flag specifies a template for the new filenames, which can include expressions that are expanded based on file attributes such as name, extension, and sequence numbers. For example, `imv -t ''newprefix-%d.ext'' *.oldext` would rename all files with an `.oldext` extension to have a new prefix of "newprefix" followed by a sequence number and the original file extension.'
        u: '[AI] The `imv` command with the `-u` flag is a Unix utility for renaming files. The `-u` option stands for "update newer file," which means that when used, the tool will only rename a file if its target (specified in the argument list) is newer than the current file. This can help prevent unintended overwriting of files when performing bulk renaming tasks.'
        v: '[AI] The `imv` command with the `-v` flag is a version of the `mv` (move or rename) command in Unix-like operating systems, with the `-v` option enabling verbose mode. In this mode, `imv` prints out a message for every file that is moved or renamed, displaying the name of the source file and the destination file, providing additional information about the operation performed. This can be helpful for understanding what actions are being taken during the command execution.'
        x: |-
            [AI] The `imv` command with the option `-x` is a part of the `ImageMagick` software suite, used for editing and converting image files.

            The `-x` option specifically is used to flip an image horizontally (i.e., mirror it across a vertical axis). When this option is applied, the resulting image will appear flipped left to right.
