documentation:
    command: '[AI] `consul config write` is a command used in the Consul configuration management tool. It allows you to set or update configuration items stored in Consul''s Key-Value store, also known as the Consul catalog. This command writes new or modified configurations into the Consul server, which then becomes effective for connected services. For instance, if you want to change a property value in a HCL configuration file, you would use this command along with the file path and new content to update the respective configuration entry in Consul.'
    flag:
        ca-file: |-
            [AI] The `flag "consul config write --ca-file"` is used in Consul, a connectivity and configuration management tool from Hashicorp. This flag is passed when using the Consul CLI (Command Line Interface) to write or update a configuration file.

            The `--ca-file` option specifies the path to a file containing the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate used to sign the server and client certificates for secure communication between Consul components. This flag ensures that only trusted servers are joined to the Consul cluster, maintaining security within the infrastructure.
        ca-path: '[AI] The `consul config write --ca-path` command is used with the Consul configuration management tool to write or update a configuration file, specifically when dealing with Certificate Authority (CA) paths. The `--ca-path` flag specifies the path to a directory containing the CA certificates. These certificates are used for securing and authenticating communications between Consul servers and clients. By providing this flag, you ensure that the new configuration is validated against trusted CAs, maintaining the security of your Consul deployment.'
        cas: '[AI] `consul config write --cas` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, a distributed configuration management and service discovery tool. This command writes or updates a configuration item in Consul''s KV (Key-Value) store with strong concurrency control using the Compare-And-Swap (CAS) algorithm. The CAS flag ensures that the new value is only written if no other client has modified the key since the provided CAS token was generated. This feature helps prevent write conflicts, ensuring data consistency within a distributed environment.'
        client-cert: '[AI] `consul config write` is a command from the Consul configuration API, used to write or update a configuration entry in Consul. The `--client-cert` option is for specifying a client SSL certificate file when making the API request. It ensures secure communication between the client and Consul server during the configuration update process.'
        client-key: '[AI] `consul config write --client-key` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Consul configuration management tool. This command writes or updates a configuration file in Consul with the specified key, using the provided client key for authentication. The client key is a unique identifier for an authenticated client in Consul. The combination of this command and client key ensures secure access to modify configurations within the Consul system.'
        datacenter: |-
            [AI] The `consul config write --datacenter` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, a distributed, highly available, and data center aware toolchain for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This specific command writes a new configuration item or updates an existing one with the specified key-value pair under the given datacenter context in Consul.

            By using `--datacenter` option, you can set the target datacenter where the configuration item will be persisted and served. It's essential when working with multi-datacenter deployments of Consul to ensure proper distribution and availability of configurations across different sites.
        http-addr: '[AI] The `flag "consul config write --http-addr"` is used in Consul, a connectivity and configuration management tool. This flag sets the HTTP address for writing configuration data to Consul. When you run a command with this flag, you specify the IP address and port number of the Consul agent or server where you want to write the configuration data. For example, `--http-addr 192.168.0.1:8500` sets the HTTP address to write to `192.168.0.1:8500`. This is useful when you need to update configuration data in a Consul deployment without affecting the running services.'
        modify-index: '[AI] `consul config write --modify-index` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul configuration management system. This command is used to modify an existing configuration file with a specific index in the version history. The `--modify-index` option specifies the index number of the configuration file that will be updated. This command makes it possible to update a configuration file while keeping track of previous versions, ensuring that configurations can be easily rolled back if necessary.'
        namespace: '[AI] `flag "consul config write --namespace"` is a command-line option in the Consul configuration tool, which allows users to write configuration data into a specific namespace within a Consul cluster. This helps to keep configurations organized and isolate them from each other, especially when managing multiple services or environments. The flag takes the desired namespace name as its argument.'
        stale: '[AI] The `consul config write --stale` command is a part of Consul, a Connect and configure service discovery, configuration management, and orchestration tool. This command is used to update or create a new configuration entry in Consul''s key-value store with the `--stale` flag indicating that the writemake may contain outdated data. This can be useful when dealing with config changes that are not yet ready for consumption by applications, but still need to be propagated quickly. It is essential to note that using `--stale` does not ensure data consistency across all agents and it should only be used in cases where the risk of inconsistency can be tolerated.'
        tls-server-name: |-
            [AI] The `consul config write --tls-server-name` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, an open-source distributed configuration and service registration tool. This command writes or updates a configuration entry with TLS server name set.

            Consul uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) for secure communication between its components. The `--tls-server-name` option sets the TLS server certificate name for secure client communication with Consul agents or servers. It helps in ensuring that the client communicates only with trusted Consul instances and prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.
        token: |-
            [AI] The `consul config write --token` command is used in Hashicorp Consul, a tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This specific command allows you to write new or modify existing configuration data in Consul using a token with the necessary permissions. It takes the following format:

            ```bash
            consul config write <key> <value> --token <your_token>
            ```

            Replace `<key>` with the desired key for the configuration item, and `<value>` with the new or modified value. Replace `<your_token>` with an active token from a Consul agent or client with write permissions to manipulate the configuration data. This command updates the configuration stored in Consul and makes it available to clients that use this service registry for discovery and configuration management.
        token-file: '[AI] `flag "consul config write --token-file"` is used in Consul configuration commands to specify a file containing an HTTP token for authentication when writing new or updating existing configuration data in a Consul server or datacenter. The flag ensures secure transfer of sensitive token information and helps maintain the security best practices by avoiding hardcoding tokens directly in scripts or commands.'
