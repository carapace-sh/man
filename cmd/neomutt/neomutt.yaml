documentation:
    command: '[AI] Neomutt is a modern, highly configurable, and efficient text-based email client written in the C programming language. It is a successor to Mutt with added features and improved performance. Neomutt supports various email protocols including IMAP, POP3, and SMTP for fetching, sending, and managing emails. It provides advanced filtering, search capabilities, and customizable key bindings to efficiently handle large email volumes. It is popular among users who prefer text-based interfaces over graphical email clients due to its flexibility, speed, and low resource requirements.'
    flag:
        A: '[AI] The `-A` flag in NeoMutt, a text-based email client, stands for "All" or "Answer All". When used, this flag tells NeoMutt to send replies to all the recipients mentioned in the email''s To, Cc, and Bcc fields. It is often utilized when you want to respond to everyone involved in an email conversation.'
        B: '[AI] The `-B` option in Neomuttt, a lightweight and highly configurable text-based email client, stands for "background mode." When using this option, Neomutt runs as a background process instead of opening a new window or terminal each time it is invoked. This can be useful for users who prefer to have their email client running continuously without manually opening it each time they want to check their emails.'
        D: '[AI] `neomutt -D` is a command-line option for the Neomutt email client. The `-D` flag enables the debug mode, which increases the verbosity of Neomutt''s output and provides more detailed information about its internal workings while it runs. This can be helpful when troubleshooting issues or understanding complex configurations.'
        E: '[AI] The `-E` option in Neomutts configuration file (`.muttrc`) enables the use of external editors for composing and editing messages. When this option is set, Neomutt will automatically launch an external editor specified by the user whenever a new message is created or an existing message is edited. This allows users to take advantage of more powerful text editors for composing emails instead of using Neomutts built-in editor.'
        F: '[AI] The `-F` flag in Neomutt, a text-based email client, is used to specify the folder or mailbox where Neomutt should retrieve emails from. It overrides the default mailbox location. For example, `neomutt -F inbox` would tell Neomutt to check the "inbox" folder for new emails.'
        G: '[AI] `-G` is an option for the Neomut mail client. It stands for "global inbox" and indicates that Neomut should manage a single, unified mailbox for all email accounts instead of treating each account as a separate mailbox. This can make it easier to manage multiple email accounts from one interface.'
        H: '[AI] The `-H` option in NeoMutt, a text-based email client, sets the mailbox hierarchy. It specifies the Mail Dir and the subdirectories for various mailboxes like Inbox, Sent, Drafts, etc. For example, `-H ~/mail:~/Mail/inbox` sets the mailbox directory to `~/mail` and the Inbox directory to `~/Mail/inbox`. This allows NeoMutt to manage email accounts with multiple mailboxes.'
        R: '[AI] The `-R` flag in the context of Neomutt, a text-based email client, stands for "reply to sender." When used with a Neomutt command, it instructs the program to open a new message window for composing a reply to the most recent message from the current mailbox. In essence, `-R` is an efficient way to initiate a response directly from Neomutt''s command line interface.'
        Z: '[AI] The `-Z` option in NeoMutt, a text-based email client, is used to enable compression of MIME parts during transfer or retrieval of emails. This can help reduce the size of emails and save bandwidth, especially when dealing with large messages or slow connections.'
        a: '[AI] The command `neomutt -a` is used to invoke the Neomut mail client with the argument `-a` which stands for "append" in this context. This option instructs Neomut to append new messages to the currently selected mailbox instead of creating a new mailbox or splitting the existing one. It''s commonly used when you want to keep all your emails in one place and prefer to have them added as they arrive.'
        b: '[AI] The `-b` flag in the Neomut mail client is used to specify the background mode of operation. When this option is passed, Neomut runs as a background process instead of opening a new terminal window or tab. This can be useful for users who prefer to have Neomut always running and receiving notifications without having an additional terminal window cluttering their workspace.'
        c: '[AI] The `-c` option in the Neomutta mail client is used to specify the configuration file to be used. Instead of using the default configuration, Neomutt looks for and uses the specified file for its settings. This can be useful when multiple users on a system have different Neomutt configurations or when customizing the client beyond the default settings.'
        d: '[AI] The `-d` flag for NeoMutt, a text-based email client, is used to enable debug mode. When this option is given during NeoMutt''s execution, it produces more detailed output and may assist in troubleshooting issues or understanding its inner workings.'
        e: '[AI] `neomutt -e` is a command-line option used with NeoMutt, an open-source, text-based email client. The `-e` flag is short for "external editor," which allows users to edit emails in an external editor instead of the built-in one. This can provide more advanced editing features and customization options for power users.'
        f: '[AI] The `-f` flag for Neomut is a configuration option that tells Neomut to use the given file as its configuration file instead of the default one. When you provide this flag followed by the path to your custom Neomut config file, Neomut will read and apply the settings from that file upon starting. This allows users to modify Neomut''s behavior according to their preferences.'
        g: '[AI] The `-g` option in NeoMutt, a text-based email client, stands for "follow threads." When this flag is used, NeoMutt will group emails in a conversation thread, meaning that replies and their parent messages are displayed together, making it easier to read email conversations. This can help users keep track of long email threads and maintain the context of the discussion.'
        h: '[AI] The `-h` option when used with the Neomutt email client invokes the help function. It displays detailed information about how to use Neomutt, including a list of available commands and their syntax. This can be useful for users who want to learn more about the capabilities of Neomutt or need a reminder of specific commands.'
        i: '[AI] The `-i` option for the Neomutt email client modifies its behavior to interactively display each message as it is fetched, rather than fetching and storing all messages in the mailbox before displaying them. This can be useful for handling large volumes of email or working with a slow network connection. When using `-i`, Neomutt will pause after each message is displayed, allowing the user to decide whether to keep it or delete it before moving on to the next message.'
        l: '[AI] The `-l` flag for the NeoMutt email client is used to display the header lines of each email message in the mailbox listing, providing information such as sender, subject, and date, before applying any filtering or sorting rules. This allows users to quickly identify emails based on their headers without having to open each individual message.'
        m: '[AI] The `-m` flag in Neomut is used to configure the mailbox selection mode. With this option, Neomut can be set to either Multi or Single mailbox mode. In Multi mode, multiple mailboxes can be displayed and accessed simultaneously, while in Single mode, only one mailbox is shown at a time. This flag helps users tailor their email client interface according to their preference and workflow.'
        "n": '[AI] The `-n` option in the context of the Neomut mail client is used to indicate no-op (no operation) mode, which means Neomut will not actually process any mail commands or make any changes to your mailboxes. It''s useful when you want to inspect Neomut''s behavior without affecting your emails.'
        p: '[AI] The `-p` flag for the Neomut mail client is used to specify the mailbox to be opened in the background when starting Neomut. It allows users to check their email without opening a new terminal window or bringing Neomut to the foreground. This can be useful for quickly checking emails while keeping other terminal sessions active.'
        s: '[AI] The `-s` option in Neomutt, a text-based email client, stands for "sorting." It is used to specify the sorting order of emails in the mailbox. By default, Neomutt sorts emails by their arrival time in reverse chronological order (newest first). However, with the `-s` flag followed by a valid sorting key, such as `"Subject"` or `"From"`, emails can be sorted based on that specific field instead. For example, `neomutt -s Subject` would sort emails by their subject lines.'
        v: '[AI] The `-v` flag for Neomutt, a text-based email client, enables verbose output. When this option is used, Neomutt will provide more detailed information about its operations and actions during execution. This can be helpful for troubleshooting or understanding the inner workings of the application.'
        "y": '[AI] The `-y` flag for the Neomutt email client is used to automatically answer yes to all prompts. This can be useful for batch processing emails or when you want to automate certain actions without being prompted each time. However, it''s important to note that using this flag indiscriminately can lead to unintended consequences, as some prompts may require your input for valid reasons. Use with caution.'
        z: '[AI] The `-z` flag for Neomutt is used to enable zeromq message passing instead of using a traditional mailbox for IMAP or POP3 communication. ZeroMQ provides a more efficient and reliable way for Neomutt to interact with mail servers, allowing for real-time notifications and faster synchronization. This can be beneficial for users who frequently check their email or have large mailboxes.'
