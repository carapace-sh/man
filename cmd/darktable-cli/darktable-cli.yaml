    command: '[AI] `darktable-cli` is a command-line interface (CLI) version of DarkTable, an open-source photography workflow application and RAW developer. With `darktable-cli`, users can perform advanced image editing tasks using DarkTable''s extensive features without the need for the graphical user interface (GUI). It provides access to a wide range of image processing tools, including color correction, exposure adjustment, noise reduction, and various filters, among others. Users can automate tasks by creating scripts or workflows, making it an efficient tool for batch processing large numbers of images.'
    flag:
        apply-custom-presets: '[AI] `darktable-cli` is a command-line interface version of Darktable, an open-source photography workflow application and raw developer. The option `--apply-custom-presets` is used to apply one or more custom presets stored in Darktable''s XML format on selected images using the command-line tool. This enables automation and batch processing of images with specific custom styling.'
        bpp: '[AI] `darktable-cli --bpp` is a command-line argument for the photo development software Darktable. The `--bpp` option stands for "bits per pixel" and is used to specify the color depth of an input image. It allows users to override the automatic detection of the color depth by Darktable, ensuring consistent processing for a batch of images with the same color depth requirement. For instance, using `--bpp 16` would force Darktable to process images as 16-bit data instead of the default 8 or 16 bits.'
        height: '[AI] The `darktable-cli --height` command is used with Darktable, an open-source photography workflow application and RAW developer. The `--height` option specifies the height of the output image or preview window in pixels. For instance, `darktable-cli --height=1080 myimage.NEF` processes the given RAW file `myimage.NEF` with a output height of 1080 pixels. This command line instruction is particularly useful when processing images programmatically or for automating tasks within the Darktable environment.'
        help,-h: '[AI] The command `darktable-cli --help` or `--h` is used to display help information about the DarkTable Command Line Interface (CLI) tool. The `--help` option requests that the CLI prints out detailed usage instructions and a list of available commands and options, making it easier for users to understand how to use the tool effectively. This can be particularly useful when working with complex software or when needing a quick refresher on specific functionality.'
        hq: '[AI] `darktable-cli --hq` is a command line usage of Darktable, an open-source photography workflow application and RAW developer. The `--hq` option stands for High Quality mode, which enables advanced demosaicing and noise reduction algorithms to produce superior image quality when processing RAW files.'
        style: '[AI] `darktable-cli --style` is a command-line option used with Darktable, an open-source photography workflow application and RAW developer. The `--style` argument specifies which preset or style to apply to the images processed by the command. This can help achieve a consistent look across multiple photos or batches of images.'
        style-overwrite: '[AI] The `darktable-cli --style-overwrite` command is a feature of Darktable, an open-source photography workflow application and RAW developer. This specific command line option is used to apply a given style directly to an image, overwriting any previously applied styles without the need to create a new version or duplicate the image. It allows for quick and efficient adjustments while preserving the original image data.'
        upscale: '[AI] `darktable-cli --upscale` is a command-line tool used with Darktable, an open-source photography workflow application and RAW developer. The `--upscale` option instructs Darktable to increase the resolution of an image while preserving its quality as much as possible. This can be useful when working with low-resolution images that need to be enlarged for printing or display at larger sizes. The command line usage includes specifying input file, output file and other optional parameters such as scale factor, interpolation method, etc.'
        verbose: '[AI] `darktable-cli --verbose` is a command used in Darktable, an open-source photography workflow application and raw developer. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output information provided by the `darktable-cli` command-line interface. This can be useful for debugging or understanding complex image processing tasks as it displays more detailed information about the operations being performed on the images.'
        version: '[AI] `darktable-cli --version` is a command used in the terminal or command prompt to check for the version information of Darktable''s Command Line Interface (CLI) application. The command will display the specific version number and build information, including any relevant commit hash, that is currently installed on your system. This can be useful for troubleshooting, ensuring compatibility with other software, or simply to keep track of which version you have running.'
        width: '[AI] The `darktable-cli --width` command is related to Darktable, an open-source photography workflow application and RAW developer. This specific command line instruction is used to set the output width of images processed by Darktable CLI (Command Line Interface). By providing a numerical value followed by this flag, you define the desired pixel width for your output files. For instance, `darktable-cli --width 1920` would generate output images with a width of 1920 pixels.'
