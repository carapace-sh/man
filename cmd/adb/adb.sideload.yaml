documentation:
    command: '[AI] "adb sideload" is a command used in Android development for installing APK (Android Package) files on devices via USB, using Android Debug Bridge (adb). The "sideload" part refers to the installation of apps outside the Google Play Store. It requires the device to be connected to the computer and the USB debugging mode enabled. The command takes an argument, which is the path to the APK file. For example, "adb sideload /path/to/apkfile.apk". This process bypasses Google Play Store restrictions and allows installing custom or third-party apps.'
