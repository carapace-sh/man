documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `stat` command is a file utilities in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It provides various statistics about files such as size, modification and access time, permission bits, number of links, ownership, and block and inode usage. The output format can be customized using different options. For example, `stat <file> --format=%s` displays only the file size in bytes.'
    flag:
        cached: '[AI] The `stat --cached` command in Linux is used to display the files'' cached file status information from the page cache of the operating system, rather than reading from the disk or inode directly. This means it shows the last access time, modification time, size, and other attributes as they are stored in memory, not necessarily reflecting the actual file system state. It is often used for debugging file system caching behavior or analyzing I/O performance.'
        dereference: '[AI] The `--dereference` option in the `stat` command is used to follow symbolic links and display the properties of the file or directory that the link points to, rather than the link itself. In other words, it allows you to get the file status information of the target of a symbolic link instead of the link itself. This can be useful when working with symbolic links in filesystem exploration or scripting tasks.'
        file-system: '[AI] The `stat --file-system` command is a Linux utility used to retrieve file and file system statistics. When used with the `--file-system` option, it specifically displays information about the file system itself, including its type, size, block and fragment sizes, mount point, and other related statistics. This can be useful for diagnosing file system issues or for gaining insight into the underlying file system configuration.'
        format: '[AI] `stat --format` is a command used in Unix-based systems to display file or folder metadata. The `--format` option allows specifying a custom output format using printf-style syntax, which can include various fields such as size, permissions, modification and access times, etc. This way, the output can be tailored to specific requirements. For instance, `stat --format=%s %filename.txt` would display only the file size, or `stat --format="%n: %Sm %y-%m-%d %H:%M" %f` would display the file name with modification time in human-readable format.'
        help: '[AI] `stat --help` is a command in Unix-like operating systems, specifically the `stat` utility. It displays file or file system information. When used with the `--help` option, it provides a brief help message that explains how to use the `stat` command with various options and arguments for displaying different types of file information.'
        printf: '[AI] `stat --printf` is a command in Unix-like operating systems, specifically the `stat` utility. The option `--printf` allows customizing the output format of the `stat` command by specifying a format string with placeholders for various statistics. For example, `%n %s %m %w %c` will print file name (%n), size (%s), mode (%m), ownership (%u/%g), and permission bits (%c). This feature can be useful in scripts or other automation tasks for extracting specific information from file stats.'
        terse: '[AI] The `stat --terse` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to display basic file information in a compact format. The `--terse` option suppresses the display of headers and other unnecessary information, making the output more succinct. The output includes columns for file size, permissions, number of hard links, owner, group, and modification time.'
        version: '[AI] `stat --version` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to display the version information of the `stat` utility. When executed, it will print out the name of the stat program, its version number, and sometimes other information such as compilation date or author. It helps users ensure they have the correct version of the stat tool installed and running on their system for performing file status checks.'
