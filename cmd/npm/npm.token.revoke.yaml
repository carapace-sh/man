description: remove an authentication token from the registry
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm token revoke` command is used to remove an authentication token from your NPM account. This is typically done when you suspect that your token has been compromised or stolen. By executing this command, you invalidate the current token and are required to generate a new one for future authentication when using npm packages or tools. It''s important to note that revoking a token will affect any processes or tools that use it, so make sure to replace it with a new one as soon as possible.'
