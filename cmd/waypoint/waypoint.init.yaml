documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint init` command is used to initialize a new Waypoint project in Google Cloud Platform. Waypoint is an open-source multi-cloud continuous deployment and delivery toolkit. When you run this command, it sets up the necessary infrastructure and configuration files for your project using the provided project name, language, and other optional flags. The initialized project can then be easily deployed and managed across multiple cloud providers like Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `waypoint init --app` command is used to initialize a new Waypoint application, which is an open-source tool for deploying and managing containerized applications across multiple clusters or environments. This command sets up the necessary directory structure and configuration files for a new Waypoint app based on a given application definition file (usually with `.toml` extension). It does not start or deploy the app, but prepares the environment for easy deployment using Waypoint''s CLI tools.'
        from-project: '[AI] The `waypoint init --from-project` command is used to initialize a new Waypoint project based on an existing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. Waypoint is an open-source tool for managing and deploying multi-container applications across various infrastructure providers. By using the `--from-project` flag, the initialization process retrieves the necessary configuration details from the specified GCP project and sets up a new Waypoint project with those configurations pre-populated. This can save time and effort when setting up a new project in Waypoint for an existing Google Cloud infrastructure.'
        into: '[AI] The `waypoint init --into` command is a part of the Waypoint configuration management tool for Kubernetes. This command initializes a new Waypoint application setup within an existing Kubernetes cluster. The `--into` flag indicates that the operation should be performed inside an existing Kubernetes namespace or project. It sets up the necessary resources such as Helm charts and Kustomize files, enabling users to deploy, manage, and scale their applications using Waypoint.'
        plain: '[AI] The `waypoint init --plain` command is used in the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) to initialize a new Waypoint application project, without creating or using a YAML configuration file. Waypoint is an open-source GitOps continuous delivery toolkit for Kubernetes that makes it easy to define, deploy, and manage applications. The `--plain` flag indicates that no scaffolding should be generated, allowing users to set up the project structure manually if desired.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint init --project` command is used to initialize a new Waypoint project. Waypoint is an open-source multi-cloud application platform from Google. This command sets up the project structure and configurations required for deploying and managing applications across multiple cloud providers using Waypoint. It creates essential files such as `config.hcl`, `up.hcl`, and initializes the `modules` directory to store custom modules. After running this command, you can begin writing your application configuration in the `config.hcl` file for deployment with Waypoint.'
        update: '[AI] `waypoint init --update` is a command used in Google Cloud''s Waypoint configuration management tool. This command initializes or updates an existing Waypoint-managed directory to use the latest Waypoint configuration and modules. It checks for new configurations, fetches any necessary dependencies, and makes adjustments to your local files accordingly. Essentially, it synchronizes your local working directory with the desired state specified in your Waypoint configuration file.'
        workspace: '[AI] `waypoint init --workspace` is a command used in Google Cloud''s Waypoint tool for managing Kubernetes clusters and applications. This command initializes a new Waypoint workspace, which sets up the necessary configuration files and directories for managing Kubernetes resources using Waypoint. It does not deploy or manage any applications at this stage, but rather prepares the environment for doing so by configuring access to target clusters and setting up the local development environment.'
