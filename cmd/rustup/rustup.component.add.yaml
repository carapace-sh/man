documentation:
    command: '[AI] `rustup component add` is a Rust package manager command used to install additional components or sub-packages for Rust toolchains. It expands the functionality of a specific Rust toolchain by adding new features, like extra documentation or improved diagnostics, without affecting other toolchains on your system. For instance, `rustup component add rls` adds the Rust Language Server component to a Rust toolchain for improved code editing experiences.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `rustup component add --help` is a Rust programming language command used to install or update Rust components managed by Rustup, which is Rust''s package manager. The `--help` option displays detailed information about the `component add` subcommand, including usage examples and available options. It explains that you can add a new component (like a specific Rust toolchain) to your Rustup installation with this command, and provides information on how to specify the component name or URL.'
        target: '[AI] `rustup component add --target` is a command used in Rust programming language''s `rustup` tool to install or update a specific target triple for the Rust compiler. A target triple specifies the operating system, architecture, and other details required to build software. For example, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` is a common target triple for building Rust projects on a 64-bit Windows system using Microsoft Visual Studio as the compiler. Adding or updating a target triple enables users to compile and run Rust code for different platforms without needing to install multiple Rust compilers.'
        toolchain: '[AI] `rustup component add --toolchain` is a command used in Rust programming language''s Rustup tool. This command adds a new Rust toolchain component to your Rustup installation. A toolchain in Rustup refers to a collection of Rust compilers and related tools that target a specific Rust version or implementation, such as stable, nightly, or a specific branch or commit. By adding a new toolchain component with `rustup component add --toolchain`, you can switch between different Rust versions easily for development or testing purposes.'
