documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git unpack-objects` is a Git command used to extract packed objects (blob, tree, and commit) from a Git pack file into the current working directory. It''s typically used during Git indexing operations or when working with large repositories where it''s more efficient to keep objects in packed format instead of fully expanding them immediately. When run, it reads the pack file and extracts the required objects, saving them as files with unique SHA-1 names under the `.git/objects` directory.'
