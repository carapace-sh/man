documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "vhs" has no meaning in standard computing terminology. It might be a reference to Video Home System, an obsolete analog video recording and playback technology used for VHS tapes. However, if it''s not related to that specific context or a typo, it likely doesn''t represent any command at all.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] The `--help` option is a common command-line argument used in various applications, including the VHS video player. When you run `vhs --help`, it displays detailed information about how to use the VHS command-line tool effectively. This includes a brief description of what the tool does, a list of available commands and their usage, as well as options that can be set for each command. The goal is to provide users with quick and easy access to the necessary information to utilize the VHS tool properly.'
        output: '[AI] The `vhs` command is not a standard Unix or Linux command, so its usage may vary depending on the specific context in which it''s being used. However, if `vhs` is a video processing tool and `--output` is an option, then this flag specifies where to write the output file of the video processing operation. It can take a file path or URL as its value. For example, `vhs --input input_video.mp4 --output output_video.mkv` would process `input_video.mp4` and save the resulting video as `output_video.mkv`.'
        publish: '[AI] The `vhs --publish` command in VHS (Video Hub Service) is used to distribute or make a video available for streaming or download by the public. When you run this command, it packages your media file(s), metadata, and other required assets, then uploads them to the VHS platform or another designated distribution channel. The published content can be accessed by viewers through various means such as web browsers, mobile apps, or other supported devices.'
        version: '[AI] The `vhs --version` command is used with the Video Home System (VHS) video tape player software or tools to display the current version or build number of the installed software. This can be helpful for troubleshooting or for checking if an update is necessary. The exact output will depend on the specific VHS software being used.'
