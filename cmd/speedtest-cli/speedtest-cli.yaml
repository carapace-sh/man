This makes it easy to import and analyze the data using spreadsheet software or other data processing tools.'
        exclude: '[AI] The `--exclude` option in `speedtest-cli`, a command-line tool for performing Internet connection speed tests, allows users to exclude specific servers or types of servers from being tested during the diagnostic process. By specifying one or more server IDs or types using this flag, the speed test will not include those servers in the selection process when determining the best server for testing. This can be useful if a user wants to avoid certain servers due to network congestion, geographical distance, or other reasons.'
        help: '[AI] `speedtest-cli --help` is a command used in the Speedtest-CLI application, which is a tool to measure the performance of an Internet connection. The `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use the application, including available commands and their options, as well as brief explanations for each one. This helps users understand how to effectively utilize the Speedtest-CLI tool to test their internet connection speeds accurately.'
        json: '[AI] `speedtest-cli --json` is a command used in the Speedtest-CLI tool, which is a popular network diagnosis application. The option "--json" tells the tool to output the test results in JSON format instead of the default human-readable format. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that can be easily parsed and processed by various programming languages. The JSON output contains detailed information about different aspects of the internet connection, such as download and upload speeds, latency, and server details. This format is useful for automated processing or integrating test results into other applications.'
        list: '[AI] `speedtest-cli --list` is a command used in Speedtest-CLI, a popular network diagnostic tool. This command displays a list of all available servers that Speedtest can use for testing internet connection performance. The list includes server locations along with their latency and bandwidth, helping users choose the optimal server for conducting speed tests.'
        mini: '[AI] `speedtest-cli --mini` is a command used in the Speedtest-CLI application. It performs a quick and lightweight speed test, which is useful when bandwidth or time is limited. The `--mini` flag reduces the amount of data transferred during the test, resulting in a faster execution time compared to a regular speed test.'
        no-download: '[AI] The `speedtest-cli --no-download` command is used with the Speedtest-CLI tool, which is a command-line interface for performing Internet connection speed tests. The `--no-download` flag instructs the tool not to download any additional files during the test process. This can be useful in scenarios where data usage or bandwidth should be minimized, such as when testing connections with limited resources or measuring network performance over a satellite link.'
        no-pre-allocate: '[AI] `speedtest-cli --no-pre-allocate` is a command used with the Speedtest-CLI tool, which is a popular command-line network diagnostic application. The `--no-pre-allocate` flag disables the pre-allocation of large amounts of system memory before running the speed test. This can be useful in environments where memory is limited or when running multiple tests simultaneously. By disabling this option, less memory is consumed during the test, allowing for potentially more tests to run concurrently without impacting system performance as significantly.'
        no-upload: '[AI] The command `speedtest-cli --no-upload` is used with the Speedtest-CLI tool, which is a popular command-line network diagnostic tool. This specific command runs a Speedtest analysis without executing the upload component. In simpler terms, it tests only the download speed of your internet connection.'
        secure: '[AI] `speedtest-cli --secure` is a command used in Speedtest-CLI, a popular network diagnosis tool. The `--secure` option ensures that the connection to the Speedtest servers is encrypted using SSL/TLS protocol for increased security during the Internet performance test. This can be important when testing connections over unsecured networks or public Wi-Fi.'
        server: '[AI] The `speedtest-cli --server` command is used with the Speedtest-CLI tool, which is a simple and efficient command-line interface for performing speed tests against various servers to measure the performance of an Internet connection. The `--server` option specifies the server or location from which to download data during the test. The tool retrieves data such as ping time, download and upload speeds, and connection consistency, helping users assess their network''s performance.'
