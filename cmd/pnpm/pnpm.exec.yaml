    command: '[AI] `pnpm exec` is a command used with PNPM (Parcel NPM), a package manager that builds on top of npm, providing features like parallel installs, faster installation times, and a more efficient workflow. The `pnpm exec` command allows you to run a script from the dependencies of your project, without having to create an entirely new package or install those dependencies separately. Simply type `pnpm exec <package>:<script>` in your terminal to execute the specified script within the desired package.'
