documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant resume` command is not a valid Vagrant command. It seems like there might be some confusion with other tools or context. In Vagrant, there isn''t a specific ''resume'' command available by default. For managing and controlling Vagrant virtual machines, use commands like `vagrant up`, `vagrant halt`, `vagrant ssh`, etc., based on your needs.'
    flag:
        no-provision: '[AI] The `vagrant resume --no-provision` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command generates a summary of the current state of all Vagrant projects in the working directory, excluding any provisioning actions. Provisioning refers to the post-creation configuration of the virtual machine using files located in the `Vagrantfile`''s `provision` section. By using the `--no-provision` flag, the output will not include details about those provisioning steps.'
        provision: '[AI] The `vagrant resume --provision` command is used to display a summary of the provisioning history for a Vagrant project. Provisioning refers to the automated configuration and management of a Vagrant virtual machine using scripts or configuration files. The output of this command includes the name, provider, and start time of each provisioning event that has occurred in the project''s history. This information can be helpful for debugging issues with provisioning, understanding when changes were made to the VM, and keeping track of configuration versions.'
        provision-with: |-
            [AI] The `vagrant resume --provision-with` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments, to display the history of provisioning actions performed on a specific Vagrant environment or VM.

            Provisioning refers to the automation of configuring and setting up a Vagrant VM with desired software packages, file permissions, and other system settings using provisioners like Ansible, Shell scripts, Chef, etc.

            The `--provision-with` option filters the output to show only the provisioning events related to a specific provisioner (e.g., "Ansible" or "Shell"). This command is helpful for debugging and understanding which provisioning actions were executed and when during the lifecycle of a Vagrant VM.
