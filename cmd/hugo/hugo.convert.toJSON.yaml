    command: '[AI] The `hugo convert toJSON` command is used in Hugo, a popular static site generator for building websites and blogs. This command converts Hugo data files into JSON format, allowing easier manipulation of the data outside of Hugo''s native structure. By using this command, you can generate plain JSON files from your Hugo-structured data, making it more flexible to work with various frontend JavaScript frameworks or other systems that require JSON data.'
