documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `wezterm connect` command is used to establish a new SSH connection from within WezTerm, a modern terminal emulator. It takes an SSH URL or hostname and port number as its argument, for example: `wezterm connect user@example.com:22`. This command opens a new tab in WezTerm and automatically sets up the SSH connection, providing a seamless experience for users looking to access remote servers.'
    flag:
        class: '[AI] The `--class` option is used with the `wezterm connect` command in Wezterm, a cross-platform terminal emulator. This option allows users to specify a custom class name for the new Wezterm tab or pane created after connecting to a server or application. The class can be later referenced using Wezterm''s styling language (WRL) or other tools to apply specific customizations to that tab or pane.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `wezterm connect --help` is a command used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator, to display help information about the "connect" subcommand. The purpose of this command is to allow users to understand how to use the "connect" feature, which establishes or re-establishes a connection with a remote server using SSH or other similar protocols.

            The output of `wezterm connect --help` includes a brief description of the subcommand, a list of possible arguments and options (e.g., `--ssh-config`, `--socket-path`, etc.), and their respective meanings and default values when not provided. This information assists users in utilizing the "connect" command effectively for their specific use cases.
        position: '[AI] `wezterm connect --position` is a command used in Wezterm, a customizable terminal emulator for Unix-based systems. This command establishes a new connection to a remote server or application and sets the terminal window position to specific coordinates within the parent window or workspace. By default, it will open a new tab with the new connection at the current position of the last closed tab. Using this command followed by the `--x` and `--y` flags (e.g., `--position=50 --x=100 --y=200`) sets the exact x and y pixel coordinates for the window placement.'
        workspace: '[AI] `wezterm connect --workspace` is a command used in Wezterm, a customizable terminal emulator for Unix-like operating systems. This command establishes a new connection to a remote server or application using the specified workspace. A workspace in Wezterm is essentially a collection of tabs, panes, and their corresponding sessions that can be saved, restored, and easily accessed. By connecting to a workspace, you are not only establishing a terminal session but also reinstating your previous setup, including tabs, layouts, and other customizations associated with that workspace.'
