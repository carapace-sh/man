    command: '[AI] `mcomix` is a graphical front-end for the `cwb` (Comic Book Archive) library, used to view and manage comic book collections in various formats such as CBR and CBZ. It allows users to navigate through pages, search for specific content, adjust the display settings, and organize their collection into folders or databases. The software is available for multiple platforms including Linux, Windows, and macOS.'
    flag:
        W: '[AI] The `mcomix` command with the option `-W` is used to extract a single image from a multi-page Comic Book Archive Format (CBAF) file. The `-W` stands for "extract one page," and it requires an argument specifying the index or filename of the desired image. For example, `mcomix -W 3 input.cbr` extracts the third page from the input file named `input.cbr`.'
        double-page: '[AI] The `mcomix` is a command-line tool used for viewing and manipulating comic book files, particularly those in the CBR (Comic Book Archive) or CBZ (Comic Book Zip) formats. The option `--double-page` is used to display two pages side by side when viewing comics with `mcomix`. This is useful for reading manga or other comic books designed to be read in a landscape orientation. When this option is set, the two adjacent pages are displayed as one image, filling the entire width of the screen while maintaining their original aspect ratio. This feature enhances the viewing experience, especially when dealing with large comics or those that have a lot of action or dialogue spread across multiple panels.'
        fullscreen: '[AI] `mcomix --fullscreen` is a command used in the mComix comic book viewer application. The `--fullscreen` option maximizes the size of the comic book window to fill the entire screen, providing an immersive viewing experience.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `mcomix` is a graphical manga and comic book reader. The `--help` option is used to display detailed help information about how to use this command-line tool. Here's a brief summary of the output:

            * `mcomix [OPTIONS] [FILE...]`: This is the basic usage, indicating that the command can take optional arguments and one or more comic files as input.
            * Options include:
              * `--db=DBTYPE:` Set the database type for storing metadata about comics. Available options are SQLite3 (default) and Gtk.

        library: '[AI] `mcomix --library` is a command-line option for the mComix comic book reader software. It specifies the directory path to the library or collection of comic books that mComix should use. This allows users to manage multiple libraries and easily switch between them while using the application.'
        manga: '[AI] `mcomix` is a command-line tool for viewing and manipulating comic books in various formats, including CBZ (Zip archive containing CBR files), CBR (Comic Book Archive), and others. The `--manga` option specifically refers to its manga mode, optimized for displaying manga or Japanese comics, which often have a different aspect ratio and reading order compared to traditional Western comic books. In this mode, pages are displayed in the correct order for right-to-left progression commonly used in manga.'
        slideshow: '[AI] `mcomix` is a command-line tool for viewing and manipulating comic book files. The `--slideshow` option is used to display a comic book as a full-screen slideshow. When you run `mcomix` with this flag, it opens the specified comic file in full-screen mode and advances through the pages automatically, creating a continuous slideshow effect. This can be useful for quickly previewing or presenting a comic book without having to manually navigate through each page.'
        version: '[AI] `mcomix --version` is a command used in the mComix comic book reader software to display its current version number. When you run this command in a terminal or console, it will print out the major and minor release numbers along with any other relevant build or revision information associated with the installed version of mComix. This can be useful for checking that you have the latest version installed or for troubleshooting issues where knowing the specific version is important.'
        zoom-best: '[AI] `mcomix` is a graphic viewer for comic books using the Multiple Open File (MOF) format. The `--zoom-best` option is a feature that allows mcomix to automatically adjust the zoom level when opening a new comic file, in order to best fit the content within the window size. This can be useful when dealing with comics of various sizes or aspect ratios, as it ensures consistent viewing experience across different files.'
        zoom-height: '[AI] The `--zoom-height` option in the `mcomix` command is used to set the height of the zoomed area when viewing a comic book file using the mcomix tool. This option allows users to adjust the size of the magnified region, enabling them to focus on specific details within the comic image.'
        zoom-width: '[AI] `mcomix --zoom-width` is a command-line option for the mComix comic book reader. It sets the width of the zoomed view when reading comics in mComix. By default, this value is not set and the size of the zoomed image will depend on the size of the comic page. Using `--zoom-width` allows users to set a specific width for the zoomed view, providing more consistent viewing experience across different comics.'
