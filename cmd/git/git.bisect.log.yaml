        [AI] The `git bisect log` command is used to view the commit history of a Git repository during a bisect session. Bisect is a Git feature that helps in finding the commit that introduced a bug or regression by automatically checking out and testing commits between two known good states.

        During a bisect run, `git bisect log` shows the commits that Git has tested so far along with their test results (good or bad). It also displays the current state of the project, the commit hash of the last known good state, and the branch name. This command is useful in understanding the progression of the bisect operation and identifying the specific commit causing the issue.
