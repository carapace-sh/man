documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git sparse-checkout` is a Git command used to set up a sparse checkout of a repository, allowing you to selectively choose which parts or directories of the working directory to be checked out. This can help reduce the amount of data that needs to be downloaded or stored, and can improve performance when working with large or complex repositories. To use `git sparse-checkout`, specify the paths or files you want to include in the checkout using a list file (specified with the `--config` option), or by individual path specifications with the `add` subcommand. Once set up, only the specified directories and files will be present in the working directory when checking out a branch or commit.'
