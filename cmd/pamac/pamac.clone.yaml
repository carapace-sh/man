documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pamac clone` is a command used in Arch Linux''s Pacman package manager''s Advanced Package Management (APy) feature, Pamac. It creates a new repository configuration based on an existing one. The syntax is `pamac clone <repository> <new-repository>`, where `<repository>` is the URL or path to an existing repository and `<new-repository>` is the name for the new repository configuration. This command is useful when you want to create a copy of an existing repository, possibly for testing purposes or to share with others.'
    flag:
        builddir: '[AI] `pamac clone --builddir` is a command used in Pacman Accounts Manager (pamac) to create a local clone of a remote Git repository and set up the build directory for it. The command clones the specified repository into a new subdirectory under the given build directory, allowing you to build and install packages locally without accessing the original remote repository directly. This is particularly useful when working offline or when dealing with unstable repositories that might cause issues during package installation.'
        overwrite: '[AI] `pamac clone --overwrite` is a command used in Pamac, Arch Linux''s package manager, for creating a new local repository (clone) from a remote one while replacing any existing files in the destination directory with those from the repository. This can be useful when updating or syncing an existing local repository to ensure it matches the latest state of the remote one.'
        quiet: '[AI] `pamac clone --quiet` is a command used in Pacman Advanced Major Version (PAMAC) package management system for Arch Linux. The `clone` subcommand is used to create a new repository mirror of the ArchLinux repositories, and the `--quiet` option suppresses progress messages during the cloning process. So, the whole command performs the task of creating a new repository mirror silently.'
        recurse: '[AI] The `pacman` command with the `clone --recurse` option is used to clone the Git repositories of all packages in the Arch Linux package manager''s repository tree. This includes cloning not only the main packages but also their dependencies recursively, meaning that it will clone the dependencies of dependencies as well, ensuring a complete local copy of the entire repository tree. This can be useful for offline use or when making modifications to packages before building and installing them locally.'
