    -h, --help: show this help message and exit
    -o, --output=: File to write to
    -q, --quiet: Quiet mode, only output error messages
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `qmk json2c` is a command used in the QMK firmware project for compiling JSON configuration files into C code. The `json2c` part of the command refers to the QMK JSON to C converter, which takes JSON-formatted keyboard layout and mapping data as input and generates corresponding C source code for inclusion into the QMK firmware project. The compiled C code can then be easily customized and integrated with other features of the QMK firmware.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `qmk json2c --help` is a command used in the QMK firmware development environment to interact with the JSON2C parser. The "--help" option displays detailed information about how to use the JSON2C parser with QMK, including available options and their meanings. It''s useful for understanding the correct syntax when defining custom key mappings or other configurations using JSON format within the QMK firmware.'
        output: '[AI] `qmk json2c --output` is a command used in the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware project to compile JSON configuration files into C code. The `json2c` sub-command converts JSON data into C code, and the `--output` flag specifies the output file name for the generated C code. So, this command generates C code from JSON files and saves it with the specified output file name.'
        quiet: '[AI] `qmk json2c --quiet` is a command used in the QMK keyboard firmware project to convert JSON configuration files into C code with minimal output. The `--quiet` flag suppresses progress messages during the conversion process. In summary, this command quietly converts JSON files to C code using QMK''s json2c tool.'
