        [AI] The `jj git fetch` command is a combination of two separate commands used in Git version control system.

        First, `git fetch` is used to retrieve and update your local repository with any new commits, files or branches from a remote repository without altering your current working directory or local commits. This command helps keep your local repository up-to-date with the latest changes from the remote.

        Secondly, `jj` is an alias for `git config --global alias.jj 'joint'`. The `joint` command is a custom Git command created by some developers to automatically fetch and switch to a specific branch (usually a development or master branch) in one step. So when you use the command `jj git fetch`, it actually fetches new changes from the remote repository, and then switches your local repository to the latest version of the specified branch.
    flag:
        all-remotes: '[AI] The `git fetch --all-remotes` command is used in Git version control system to fetch all branches and commits from all remote repositories that are configured for the local repository. It does not merge or modify the local repository in any way, but only updates the local repository with the latest data from the remotes. This can be useful for keeping a local repository up-to-date with multiple remote origins or tracking branches.'
        branch: |-
            [AI] The command `git fetch --branch jj` does the following:

            1. Fetch: This is a Git command that retrieves new data from a remote repository but doesn't merge or modify your local commits in any way.
            2. `--branch jj`: This option tells Git to fetch not only the latest tips of all branches but also the entire branch named "jj" (including its history). The local repository won't have this branch yet, so this action prepares you for creating a new local tracking branch based on the fetched one.
        help: '[AI] The command `git fetch --help` is used in Git version control system to display detailed help information about the `fetch` sub-command. `fetch` is a Git command that retrieves and updates local branches with new work from remote repositories without integrating or applying those changes to your local commits. By adding `--help`, you request Git to show the available options and their descriptions for this specific command, allowing users to understand how it works and what arguments they can use when employing it in various scenarios.'
        remote: '[AI] The command `git fetch --remote` is used in Git version control system to retrieve new commits and updates from a remote repository that you have configured with a unique name using the `remote add` command. This action does not modify your local working directory or master branch, it just downloads the latest changes from the remote repository for you to merge or cherry-pick later. It''s important to note that this command updates your local Git repository with new information without affecting any of your local branches.'
