documentation:
    command: '[AI] `rmdir` is a command used in various operating systems including Windows and DOS to remove empty directories. To use it, open a command prompt or PowerShell window and navigate to the parent directory of the directory you want to delete. Then type `rmdir <directory_name>` without the angle brackets and press Enter. If the directory is empty, it will be deleted. If the directory contains files or subdirectories, you''ll receive an error message and need to use a different command such as `rmdir /S /Q <directory_name>` in PowerShell or `rmdir /S /F <directory_name>` in DOS to delete directories with contents.'

        help: |-
            [AI] `rmdir` is a command-line utility in Windows and some Unix-like operating systems for removing empty directories. The `--help` option is used to display detailed help information about the command. When you run `rmdir --help`, it will show you a message containing:

            1. A brief description of what `rmdir` does.
            2. Syntax and usage instructions, including the correct format for the command with or without options.
            3. A list of available options and their meanings, such as force deletion (`/S /Q` in Windows), preserving empty directories (`--ignore-fail-on-empty` in Unix-like systems), and more.
            4. Explanations for each option, including any dependencies or restrictions.
            5. Examples of how to use the command effectively.
        ignore-fail-on-non-empty: '[AI] The `rmdir` command with the option `--ignore-fail-on-non-empty` is used in Unix-like operating systems for removing empty or non-empty directories. With this option, if you try to remove a directory that contains files or subdirectories, instead of raising an error and terminating the command, it will simply ignore that failure and continue with the next directory. This can be useful when dealing with scripts where some directories may be empty while others have contents.'
        parents: '[AI] `rmdir --parents` is a command in Unix-like operating systems, specifically for removing empty directories. The `--parents` option causes the removal of not only the given directory but also any intermediate empty parent directories leading to it. It recursively removes the entire directory hierarchy as long as all directories are empty. This can be useful when dealing with a tree-like directory structure where you want to remove an entire subtree rooted at a specific directory.'
        verbose: '[AI] `rmdir --verbose` is a command in Windows and Unix-like operating systems used to remove empty directories. The `--verbose` option makes the command output detailed information about the directory being removed, such as the full pathname of the directory before it is deleted. This can be helpful for confirming that the correct directory is being deleted or for tracking changes in a script or automated process.'
        version: '[AI] `rmdir --version` is a command used in various Unix-like operating systems, including Windows, to remove empty directories. The `--version` option is used to display the version information of the `rmdir` utility itself, providing details such as its name, version number, and compilation options. It helps users identify which version of the command they are using for troubleshooting or compatibility checks.'
