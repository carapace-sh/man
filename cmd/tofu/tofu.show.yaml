    command: '[AI] The `tofu show` command is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It seems to be specific to Tofu, a modern and user-friendly file manager for Wayland. This command is used to display detailed information about a selected file or directory in the Tofu file manager interface.'
    flag:
        json: '[AI] The command `tofu show -json` is a command from the Tofu API, which is an open-source tool for managing Kubernetes clusters. This specific command is used to retrieve information about a Kubernetes resource in JSON format. The "show" action displays detailed information about the specified resource, and the "-json" flag tells Tofu to output the result as a JSON document instead of human-readable format.'
        no-color: '[AI] The "tofu show -no-color" flag is a command-line option used in some Unix-based systems, specifically for multimedia software like FFmpeg. This flag instructs the software to process an input file without applying any color filters or manipulations. In simpler terms, it keeps the output video or image in black and white (grayscale) format.'
