documentation:
    command: '[AI] `helm get all` is a Helm CLI (Tiller) command used to retrieve the latest chart revisions for all installed releases in the local Helm repository. It synchronizes the chart repositories with the remote chart servers, ensuring that your local Helm installation has access to the most recent versions of charts.'
    flag:
        revision: '[AI] `helm get all --revision` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command retrieves all the releases (deployed applications) managed by Helm in the local chart repository or remote chart repositories, along with their specific revisions (the snapshot of the chart at a particular point in time). The revision information helps to manage and rollback to previous versions if needed.'
        template: '[AI] `helm get all --template` is a command used with Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command retrieves all releases managed by Helm in YAML format and applies a template to the output. The --template flag instructs Helm to render the templates rather than just returning the raw YAML files. As a result, you get the final Kubernetes manifests that would be applied if you were to use `helm install` or `helm upgrade`. This can be useful for generating manifests for testing, auditing, or other purposes without actually deploying them to your cluster.'
