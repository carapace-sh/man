documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vagrant plugin uninstall` is a command used in Vagrant, a software provisioning tool for virtual machines. The purpose of this command is to remove a previously installed Vagrant plugin from your local system. You provide the plugin name as an argument to the command, for example: `vagrant plugin uninstall vagrant-vbguest`. This command modifies the Vagrantfile or other configuration files to comment out or remove any references to the unwanted plugin, effectively disabling it.'
    flag:
        local: '[AI] `vagrant plugin uninstall --local` is a command used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. This command is used to uninstall a locally installed Vagrant plugin. The `--local` option specifies that only the locally installed instance of the plugin should be uninstalled, as opposed to all instances across all Vagrant projects. Once executed, the plugin will no longer be available for use in the current Vagrant installation.'
