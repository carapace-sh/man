documentation:
    command: '[AI] `gh search code` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to search for repositories containing specific code patterns or snippets within their source files on GitHub. The results are displayed in the terminal with useful metadata such as repository name, language, and number of matches in each file. It''s an efficient way to find relevant projects based on a particular coding need.'
    flag:
        extension: '[AI] The `gh search code --extension` command is used with GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, called `gh`. This specific command searches for code snippets or files on GitHub based on a given query, but only returns results that match the provided file extension(s). For instance, if you search for ''function react'' --extension ''.js'', it will return React JavaScript files containing the term ''function'' and ''react''.'
        filename: '[AI] The command `gh search code --filename` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) query used to find repositories containing specific code in file names. This search is performed on GitHub''s extensive repository database. By using the `--filename` flag, the search will focus only on results where the given code snippet exists within file names instead of the entire repository content.'
        jq: '[AI] `gh search code` is a command from GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, used to search for repositories containing specific code. The `--jq` option is passed to `gh` to apply JSON queries using the `jq` language, allowing users to manipulate and filter the output in various ways before displaying it on the terminal. In summary, `gh search code --jq` is used to search for repositories containing specific code with advanced filtering capabilities provided by `jq`.'
        json: '[AI] `gh search code` is a command from GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, which allows users to search for code within public repositories on GitHub. The `--json` option requests that the output be returned in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, enabling easy parsing and processing of the results by scripts or other applications.'
        language: '[AI] The `gh search code` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool used to search for code on GitHub. The `--language` option filters the results to show only files written in a specific programming language specified by the user. For instance, `gh search code --language python` will return files with Python code only.'
        limit: '[AI] `gh search code` is a GitHub command used to search for code within public repositories on GitHub. The `--limit` flag is an option that specifies the maximum number of search results you want to retrieve. By default, `gh search code` returns up to 10 results. If you want more than 10 results, you can use the `--limit` flag followed by the number of results you want. For example, `gh search code --limit 20` will return the first 20 results that match your search query.'
        match: '[AI] `gh search code --match` is a command used in GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, called "gh." This command searches for code within public repositories on GitHub. The `--match` flag specifies a regular expression pattern to filter the search results. When you provide a valid regex pattern with this flag, the command returns only the results that match the given pattern in their file or commit messages.'
        owner: '[AI] The `gh search code --owner` command is used with GitHub''s Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, gh. This command searches for repositories where a specific user is listed as the owner. The results include the name, description, language, and number of stars for each matching repository. It helps developers quickly find other projects from a particular user.'
        repo: '[AI] The `gh search code` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) tool provided by GitHub to search for code within repositories or across all public repositories on GitHub. The `--repo` flag is an option that restricts the search scope to only specific repositories instead of the entire GitHub platform. So, using `gh search code --repo [REPO_NAME]` will return matches from the specified repository only.'
        size: '[AI] The `gh search code` command is a GitHub CLI tool used to search for code within repositories or code snippets on GitHub. The `--size` option filters the search results by the number of lines in the matching file, with options like "larger:<number>", "smaller:<number>", or "exact:<number>" to specify the desired file size. So, `gh search code --size larger:50` will return results with files having more than 50 lines.'
        template: '[AI] `gh search code` is a command from GitHub''s CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, called `git-hub`. The `--template` option in this context is used to specify a custom output format for the results of the search query. It takes a string that defines the structure of the output using Mustache templates. This allows users to extract specific information from the search results according to their needs.'
        web: '[AI] `gh search code` is a command from GitHub''s CLI tool (git-hub). It is used to search for code within public repositories on GitHub. The `--web` flag modifier opens the search results directly in your web browser after the search completes, providing a more convenient way to view and navigate through the search results.'
