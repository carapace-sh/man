    command: '[AI] `xbacklight` is a command-line utility in Linux for adjusting the backlight level of an attached LCD or LED display. It interacts with the Xorg server to control the backlight intensity, typically measured in millicandelas (mCd). By providing an argument representing the desired brightness level, you can use it to increase or decrease the display''s backlight, thus altering the overall screen brightness.'
    flag:
        d: '[AI] The command `xbacklight` is a tool in Linux used to set or get the backlight level of an X11 display. The option `-d` is used to get the current display''s maximum and minimum backlight levels, which can be useful for applications that need to know the range of possible values. So, `xbacklight -d` displays the display''s current maximum and minimum backlight levels without making any change to the current setting.'
        dec: '[AI] The command `xbacklight -dec` is used in Linux to decrease the backlight level of a display or monitor. The `xbacklight` tool is part of the xorg-x11-utils package and allows controlling the brightness of the display''s backlight using the command line. The `-dec` option stands for "decrease" or "down", meaning that it will decrease the current backlight level by a step, as defined by the system configuration.'
        display: '[AI] The command `xbacklight` is a tool in Linux used to set or query the backlight level of a display. The option `-display <DISPLAY>` specifies which X11 display to modify. It''s important for multiple displays or when running graphical applications in a multi-user system. Without this option, the command would affect the default display only.'
        get: '[AI] `xbacklight` is a command-line utility in X Window System for controlling the backlight level of supported displays. The command `xbacklight -get` is used to retrieve the current backlight level setting of the primary display without making any changes to it. In other words, it returns the current brightness level as an integer value.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `xbacklight` is a command-line utility for setting the backlight level of X11 compatible displays. The `-help` option is used to display a brief help message that summarizes the usage and available options of the `xbacklight` command. Here's what you can expect from the output:

            ```
            Usage: xbacklight [OPTION]... [SCREEN] [LEVEL]
            Set or get backlight level for screen SCREEN. LEVEL is a number from 0 (off) to 15 (max).

            Options:
              -query                   Query the current backlight level(s).
              -all                     Apply command to all connected displays.
              -timeout TIMEOUT        Wait TIMEOUT seconds for a response.
              -verbose                Print detailed information about each display.
              -help                    Display this help message and exit.
            ```

            In summary, `xbacklight -help` will show you how to use the `xbacklight` command along with the list of available options that can be used when setting or querying the backlight level for X11 displays.
        inc: '[AI] The `xbacklight` command is a utility in X11 (X Window System) used to adjust the backlight or brightness level of display hardware, if supported. The `-inc` option stands for "increase by a constant value." When using this option with `xbacklight`, it increases the current backlight level by the specified value each time it''s called. For example, `xbacklight -inc 10` would increase the backlight level by ten units. The exact behavior may depend on the specific display hardware and its capabilities.'
        set: '[AI] `xbacklight` is a command-line utility in X Window System for controlling the backlight brightness level of connected devices like LCD screens or keyboards. The `-set` option followed by a numeric value sets the backlight brightness level to that value. For example, `xbacklight -set 120` would set the backlight brightness level to 120.'
        steps: '[AI] The `xbacklight` command is a utility in X Window System for controlling the brightness of the backlight of a display or laptop screen. The option `-steps` sets the number of discrete brightness levels that can be selected. For example, `xbacklight -steps 10` will allow choosing from 10 different brightness levels.'
        time: '[AI] `xbacklight` is a command-line utility in X Window System used to set the backlight or brightness level of your display. The option `-time` is not a valid option for this command, as documented in its manual page. If you meant to use other options such as `-set` or `-get` followed by a specific number to set or query the current backlight level, respectively.'
        version: '[AI] `xbacklight` is a command-line utility in X Window System used to adjust the backlight or brightness level of graphical user interfaces, such as monitors and keyboards. The `-version` option is used to display the version information of the installed `xbacklight` application, including its name, version number, and compilation date. This can be helpful in determining if an update is necessary or for troubleshooting purposes.'
