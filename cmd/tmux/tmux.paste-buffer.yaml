    command: '[AI] The `tmux paste-buffer` command is used in the TMUX terminal multiplexer to paste the contents of a copy mode buffer into the current pane or window. When you use the default key combination `Ctrl+B``[``Y` to copy text in TMUX, it gets stored in the copy mode buffer. To paste this copied text, use the `paste-buffer` command followed by the window number or pane index if you have multiple panes or windows open, or simply run it without any argument to paste into the current one. For example: `tmux paste-buffer 0.1` (for window 0, pane 1) or `tmux paste-buffer` for the current pane or window.'
    flag:
        b: '[AI] `tmux paste-buffer` is a command in the tmux terminal multiplexer that retrieves the contents of the copy mode buffer, which is where tmux stores text that has been selected for pasting. The `-b` option specifies that only the buffer''s contents should be outputted, without pasting it into the current terminal window. So, `tmux paste-buffer -b` returns the contents of the copy mode buffer as plain text, without actually pasting it.'
        d: '[AI] The `tmux paste-buffer` command in TMUX is used to read data from a buffer and paste it into the active pane or window. The `-d` option stands for "mode: detach," which means that the operation will be performed in the background, without attaching or reattaching any sessions. So, `tmux paste-buffer -d` reads the contents of the copy mode buffer and pastes it into the active pane or window as a detached operation.'
        p: '[AI] `tmux paste-buffer -p` is a command in the Tmux terminal multiplexer. It displays the contents of the copy mode''s selection or the copy buffer, which holds text that has been copied using Tmux''s built-in copy and paste features. The `-p` option causes the output to be printed on the terminal rather than being copied to the system clipboard.'
        r: '[AI] `tmux paste-buffer -r` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer that pastes the contents of the copy mode''s selection or the most recent copy into the active pane or window. The `-r` flag stands for "raw" and indicates that the text should be pasted without any special character interpretation, such as treating backslashes as escape characters. This command is useful when you want to paste text exactly as it was copied, preserving formatting and special characters.'
        s: '[AI] `tmux paste-buffer -s` is a command in the TMUX terminal multiplexer. It refers to the copy mode (paste-buffer) feature that stores copied data in a buffer. The `-s` flag is used to show the contents of the paste buffer on the terminal. Effectively, this command displays the text currently stored in the TMUX paste buffer.'
        t: '[AI] The `tmux paste-buffer -t` command in TMUX is used to display the contents of the copy (or `-1` for the most recent copy) buffer. The `-t` flag specifies that only the target pane or window ID should be printed before pasting the buffer''s contents. This can be useful when working with multiple panes or windows, allowing you to paste the buffer into the correct location by specifying the corresponding ID.'
