documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `dagger session` command is a part of Dagger, an open-source build and dependency management tool for Java and Kotlin projects. It creates and manages a new build session with the specified configuration. When you run `dagger session`, it launches a new build environment and connects your IDE or terminal to it, allowing you to execute tasks, such as building your project or generating dependencies graphs. This command is useful when working on large projects that require multiple builds or when you want to isolate your build environment from the rest of your system.'
    flag:
        label: '[AI] The `--label` flag in Dagger sessions is used to assign a label to a running container or workflow. This can be useful for managing and identifying multiple instances of the same application, as labels can be queried using Kubernetes or other orchestration tools. For example, you might use `--label app=myapp` to distinguish between different deployments of an application called "myapp" in your cluster.'
