    command: |-
        [AI] The `waypoint config source-get` command in Waypoint, an open-source multi-cloud infrastructure automation tool by Google, is used to retrieve a specific configuration value from a Waypoint module or HCL file.

        This command takes one required argument which is the name of the configuration item to be fetched. It returns the value of that configuration item as output. This can be useful for querying and accessing specific configuration values without having to modify the underlying configuration files directly.
    flag:
        app: '[AI] `waypoint config` is a command in Google Cloud''s Waypoint infrastructure configuration tool. The specific command `config source-get --app` retrieves the current configuration for an named application defined in Waypoint''s YAML configuration files. This command does not modify the configuration but returns it as output, allowing users to inspect or further process the data.'
        plain: '[AI] `waypoint` is an open-source configuration management tool for managing multi-cluster Kubernetes environments. The command `waypoint config source-get --plain` is used to retrieve the raw, plain text representation of a specific configuration in Waypoint. The `source-get` subcommand retrieves the configuration data from the remote source, such as a Git repository or a Hashicorp''s Sentinel policy, and the `--plain` flag indicates that the output should be in plain text format rather than HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) format. This command can be useful for manually editing the configuration files or for scripting purposes.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint config source-get --project` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source infrastructure configuration and delivery tool by Google. This command retrieves the latest version of a specific project''s configuration from the configured source control repository using Waypoint''s built-in Git support. In simpler terms, it fetches the latest configuration files for a given project from its source code repository.'
        type: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint config source-get --type` command is a part of Google's Waypoint configuration management tool. This command is used to retrieve specific configurations from external sources, such as Git repositories or other Waypoint-managed configurations.

            The `source-get` subcommand retrieves the configuration data. The `--type` option specifies the type of source, such as "git" or "hclfile". This tells Waypoint to look for the configuration data in a Git repository (using a URL or local path) or an HCL file, respectively.

            In summary, this command is used to retrieve configurations stored externally using Waypoint, and it specifies the type of source (Git or HCL file) from which the configuration should be fetched.
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint config source-get --workspace` command is used in Hashicorp''s Waypoint configuration management tool to retrieve configuration data from a specific workspace''s source of truth. This can be a Git repository, a Consul KV store, or any other data source supported by Waypoint. By specifying `--workspace`, you indicate that the configurations belong to a particular workspace and not the default one. The `source-get` subcommand retrieves the latest version of these configurations for use in your Waypoint workflows.'
