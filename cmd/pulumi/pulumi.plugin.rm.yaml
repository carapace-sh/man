    command: '[AI] The `pulumi plugin rm` command is used to remove Pulumi plugins that have been installed in your project or global environment. Plugins extend the functionality of Pulumi by providing new resources, bindings, or other features. To use this command, first, ensure you have the Pulumi CLI installed and are in a directory with a `pulumi.yml` file or a `Pulumi.runtimeconfig.json` file if using the .NET SDK. Then, run `pulumi plugin list` to see a list of currently installed plugins. To remove a specific plugin, use the `rm` command followed by the plugin name and version, such as `pulumi plugin rm myplugin 1.0.0`. If you want to remove all plugins, use `pulumi plugin rm --all`. Note that removing plugins may affect your project''s functionality.'
