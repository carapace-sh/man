documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `gh pr lock` command is used in GitHub''s `gh` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool to prevent further changes on a specific pull request. Once locked, no new commits can be pushed to the branch associated with that pull request. This is useful when you want to keep the pull request in its current state for review or discussion before merging it into the main branch.'
    flag:
        reason: '[AI] The `gh pr lock` command is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to lock a specific pull request (PR). By adding `--reason "<reason>"` argument, you are providing a reason for why the PR has been locked. This reason will be displayed on the PR page and can help communicate to collaborators the status or intent of the PR. Once a PR is locked, no further changes can be pushed to it unless the lock is removed.'
