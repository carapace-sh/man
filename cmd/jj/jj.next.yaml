    command: '[AI] The `jj next` command is used in Vim or JetBrains'' IntelliJ IDEA text editors for navigating through code. It is a custom key mapping, usually bound to `Ctrl+N`, that moves the cursor to the next piece of code with similar structure or syntax. This can be particularly useful when working on larger projects with complex code structures. However, its behavior may depend on the specific configuration or plugin used.'

            [AI] The `jj next --edit` command is a combination of two separate commands used in Vim, a popular text editor.

            1. `jj`: It represents two keystrokes - `j` and `j`. This sequence is typically used to move the cursor down one line twice, similar to using the `down arrow` key twice.
            2. `next`: It's a Vim command that moves the cursor to the next occurrence of the text under the cursor (search term) in the current direction. For example, if the cursor is on the word "apple" and you use the `n` command, Vim will search for the next occurrence of "apple" in the document and move the cursor there.
            3. `--edit`: This is an optional argument for some Vim commands that puts you into edit mode once the search term is found, allowing you to make changes to the text at the location. If not used, Vim will simply move the cursor to the next occurrence without entering edit mode.

            So, `jj next --edit` would first move the cursor down two lines, then search for and move to the next occurrence of the text under the cursor while entering edit mode at that location.
        help: '[AI] `jj next --help` is a command used in the Jupyter Notebook editor, jupyter-jsonnet (jj), to display help information about the "next" subcommand. The "next" subcommand is used to navigate through cells in a Jupyter Notebook. When run with the "--help" flag, it provides a brief description of what the "next" command does and the available options for customizing its behavior.'
