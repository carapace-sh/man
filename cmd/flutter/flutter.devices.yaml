    -h, --help: Print this usage information.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `flutter devices` command is used to list all the connected devices, emulators, and simulators available for development with Flutter. It helps developers identify where they can test and deploy their applications. This command provides information such as device name, type (physical or emulator), and whether it''s currently online or offline.'
    flag:
        device-timeout: '[AI] `flutter devices --device-timeout` is a command used in Flutter development to set or query the timeout duration for device tests. When running tests on multiple devices, specifying a timeout helps prevent tests from running indefinitely when a device fails or takes too long to complete the test. The timeout can be set in seconds using the `--device-timeout` option followed by the desired value. For example, `flutter devices --device-timeout=300` sets the timeout to 5 minutes (300 seconds). Without specifying a timeout, Flutter uses its default value for each device type.'
        help: '[AI] `flutter devices --help` is a command used in the Flutter framework to display information about available device configurations for testing and deploying applications. It lists all connected devices, their capabilities, and the specific Flutter or Android/iOS emulators that can be used with each one. Using this command without any arguments simply prints out detailed help text on how to use it effectively.'
        machine: |-
            [AI] The `flutter devices --machine` command is a utility provided by Flutter, a mobile app development framework, to interact with the Android or iOS devices connected to your development machine for testing and debugging purposes.

            When you run this command in your terminal or command prompt, it lists the connected devices along with their device name, model, operating system version, and other relevant details. The `--machine` option is used to filter the output to only display the machine-related information, such as the IP addresses, serial numbers, and platform versions of the devices.

            This command does not directly deploy an app to a device but serves as a means to identify and manage connected devices for further Flutter development tasks like building, testing, or deploying your apps using tools such as `flutter run`, `flutter build`, and `flutter publish`.
