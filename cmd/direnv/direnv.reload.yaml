description: triggers an env reload
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `direnv reload` is a command used in Unix-based systems to update the environment variables managed by Direnv, a directory-scoped environment variable loader. It reloads and applies any new or modified environment variables for the current directory and its subdirectories, overriding any previously set values. This is useful when making changes to `.env` files or other configuration sources and wanting those updates to take effect immediately without having to change directories.'
