        [AI] `md5sum` is a command-line utility used to compute the MD5 message-digest checksum of files. The MD5 checksum is a fixed-size hash value derived from the data in a file, which can be used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the file. When you run `md5sum` followed by the filename or filenames, it outputs both the original file's MD5 hash value and the filename with the checksum appended as output. For example:

        ```bash
        $ md5sum file.txt
        [output]:
        Md5sum of file.txt (1234 bytes):
        <MD5 hash value> file.txt
        ```

        You can also compare MD5 checksums between files to ensure they are identical:

        ```bash
        $ md5sum file1.txt file2.txt
        [output]:
        Md5 sum validation
        file1.txt: <MD5 hash value 1>
        file2.txt: <MD5 hash value 2>

        If the output shows identical MD5 hash values, then both files are bit-for-bit identical.
        ```
    flag:
        binary: '[AI] The `md5sum --binary` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems used to compute the MD5 hash value of files. The `--binary` option is used to output the raw binary data of the MD5 hash instead of the traditional text representation with colons separating each group of two hexadecimal digits. This can be useful when comparing hashes programmatically or for use in scripts.'
        check: '[AI] `md5sum --check` is a command used in Unix-based systems to verify the integrity of files by comparing their computed MD5 hash values against precomputed and stored hash values. The command takes an input file or a list of files, computes their MD5 hashes (if not already present), and then displays or writes the computed hashes next to their corresponding stored hashes in a checksum file. If all the hashes match, the integrity of the files is assumed to be intact. If any hash does not match, it indicates that the file may have been corrupted or tampered with during transfer or storage.'
        help: |-
            [AI] The `md5sum` is a command-line utility used for generating and checking MD5 hash values. The `--help` option displays detailed usage information when run with this flag:

            ```bash
            $ md5sum --help

            MD5 checksums, v1.0.1

            Usage: md5sum [Options] [Files]...

            Options:
              -c, --check        only check MD5SUMs; print names of FDs with mismatched checks, or nothing if all checked OK
                  --quiet         do not print 'md5:' prefix on output
                  --status         print names of Files for which the MD5 checksum is OK, and a message for those that are not OK
              -s, --show-size     in addition to the checksum show file sizes (default: only checksums)
              -t, --test          test files without checking their actual contents; print names of possible errors (damaged or missing)
                  --verbose        verbose output
              -r, --recursive      recursively calculate the MD5 of Files and directories
              -B, --binary         treat Files as binary data (default: text data)
              -i, --input-prefix=PREFIX
                                  use PREFIX instead of '-' or ':' as input file name separator (e.g., '/') in the output (default: none)
              -a, --append         append to existing checksum files instead of overwriting them
              -o, --output=File     write checksums to File rather than to stdout
                  --help             display this help and exit
            ```

            This command provides various options for checking MD5 hash values, including checking existing files against stored hashes (`-c`), outputting the file sizes along with the hash value (`-s`), testing files without actually reading their contents (`-t`), and recursively calculating hash values for files and directories (`-r`). Additional options include treating files as binary data, customizing input file name separators, appending to existing checksum files instead of overwriting them, and displaying detailed help information.
        ignore-missing: '[AI] `md5sum --ignore-missing` is a command used in Unix or Linux systems to calculate the MD5 checksum of files. The `--ignore-missing` option tells the command to skip calculating the MD5 sum for files that do not exist, instead of returning an error. This allows the calculation of checksums for only the existing files specified, without interrupting the process for missing ones.'
        quiet: '[AI] `md5sum --quiet` is a command-line utility in Unix-based systems used to compute the MD5 hash value of files. The `--quiet` option suppresses all non-error output, providing only the MD5 checksum without any accompanying text. This can be useful when automating scripts or comparing large numbers of files where only the hashes are required.'
        status: '[AI] `md5sum --status` is a command used in Unix-based systems to check the MD5 message digest of one or more files and display only the file name and its corresponding MD5 checksum if they match the expected values. The output will indicate which files have valid MD5 checksums and which ones do not, allowing for quick verification of file integrity without having to manually compare long strings of digits.'
        strict: '[AI] `md5sum --strict` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems for checking the integrity of files by calculating their MD5 message-digest algorithm checksums. The `--strict` option increases the security by refusing to consider the check failed if even a single byte of data has been changed, ensuring that any modification to the file results in an MD5 checksum failure. This strict verification is helpful for maintaining file integrity and preventing unintended data corruption or manipulation.'
        tag: '[AI] `md5sum --tag` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to check the MD5 hash sum of files specified on the command line, while also displaying corresponding file names from a tag file. The tag file usually contains one file name per line, which should correspond to the filename of an MD5 summarized file. This can be useful for checking the integrity of files in a large directory without having to manually match filenames.'
        text: '[AI] `md5sum --text` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to generate MD5 hash values of files. The `--text` option, specifically, is used to display the MD5 checksum as plain text instead of appending it to the filename and creating a new file. Therefore, when you run `md5sum --text <file>`, you will see the MD5 hash value printed on the terminal without any output file being created.'
        version: '[AI] `md5sum --version` is a command used in Unix-based systems to display the version information of the installed MD5 checksum calculation utility. When executed, it returns output containing the name of the MD5 sum program and its corresponding version number. This can be useful for checking which version of md5sum is currently installed on a system.'
        warn: '[AI] `md5sum --warn` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to calculate the MD5 checksum of files. The `--warn` option is used to produce warning messages when the calculated MD5 checksum does not match the expected one, but still output both the computed and the reference checksums. This allows users to review the differences and decide whether to proceed with potentially corrupted data.'
        zero: '[AI] `md5sum --zero` is a command used in Unix-based systems to compute the MD5 checksum of files and generate an MD5 hash output. The "--zero" option generates an output with a leading zeroes filled up to a specified length for theMD5 hash value. For example, if you use `md5sum --zero -t 32 filename`, it will produce a hash output where each line contains a hash value of length 32 with leading zeros. This is useful when comparing checksums or verifying file integrity across different systems.'
