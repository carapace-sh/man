    command: '[AI] The `yes` command in Unix-like operating systems is a simple utility that prints the given string (by default, "y\n") to standard output, repeatedly, as many times as specified by an argument or until interrupted by a signal. If no arguments are provided, it will print "yES" instead of just "y". For instance, `yes y` prints "y", and `yes y y` prints "yy". The command is commonly used in shell scripts for generating test data or as input to other commands.'
    flag:
        help: |-
            [AI] The `--help` option is a common command-line argument used in various programs and scripts, including those written in the Bash programming language. It is typically invoked by running `command --help`, where `command` represents the name of the specific program or script being used.

            When passed to a command, the `--help` flag displays detailed information about how to use the command correctly, including available options, their syntax, and usage examples. This information is usually presented in a user-friendly format designed to help users understand how to effectively utilize the command for its intended purpose.
        version: '[AI] The `--version` option is used with various command-line tools, including Git and Node.js, to display their current version number. When you run a command such as `git --version` or `node --version` followed by the `--version` flag, the output will be a string showing the specific version of the software that is installed on your system.'
