name: mousemove_relative
description: Move the mouse x,y pixels relative to the current position of the mouse cursor
flags:
    --clearmodifiers: See CLEARMODIFIERS
    --polar: Use polar coordinates
    --sync: After sending the mouse move request, wait until the mouse is actually moved
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `xdotool mousemove_relative` is a command from the X11 utility `xdotool`, used to move the computer''s mouse pointer relative to its current position by a specified number of pixels. The syntax for this command is typically `xdotool mousemove <number_of_pixels_horizontally> <number_of_pixels_vertically>`. For example, `xdotool mousemove 10 20` would move the pointer 10 pixels to the right and 20 pixels down.'
    flag:
        clearmodifiers: '[AI] `xdotool` is a versatile and powerful tool for automating various tasks in X11-based systems. The command `mousemove_relative --clearmodifiers` specifically instructs `xdotool` to move the mouse pointer relative to its current position by the given offset without pressing any keyboard modifier keys (like Shift, Control, or Alt) during the movement. This can be useful for creating automated scripts that simulate mouse movements without triggering unintended key presses or system-wide shortcuts.'
        polar: |-
            [AI] The command `xdotool mousemove_relative --polar` is a part of the xdotool tool in Linux, which allows users to automate various tasks involving the X Window System's graphical user interface.

            This specific command moves the mouse pointer in a polar coordinate system relative to its current position. The `--polar` flag indicates that the coordinates are given in polar form instead of cartesian (x,y). The `mousemove_relative` command moves the mouse pointer an absolute distance from its current position rather than to an absolute screen position. Thus, this command changes the position of the mouse pointer based on the angle and radial distance specified in the polar coordinates.
        sync: '[AI] The command `xdotool mousemove_relative --sync` is a utility from the xdotool toolkit used for automating and interacting with the X Window System graphical user interface. This specific command moves the mouse pointer a relative distance, specified elsewhere in the command line or interaction sequence, and waits for the server to confirm the action before continuing. The `--sync` option ensures that the operation is completed synchronously, meaning the script or user will not proceed until the mouse movement has been acknowledged by the X server.'
