documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tmux` `delete-buffer` command is used to delete the currently selected buffer or window pane in the `tmux` terminal multiplexer. When you run this command, the active buffer or pane will be closed and its contents will no longer be accessible within your `tmux` session. This can be useful when working with multiple buffers or panes, allowing you to clean up resources as needed. Remember that you must be in a `tmux` session and have a buffer or pane selected before executing this command.'
    flag:
        b: '[AI] The `tmux` command `delete-buffer -b <buffer>` is used to delete a named buffer in the `tmux` terminal multiplexer. This command removes the specified buffer from the list of available buffers, discarding any unsaved changes. Only buffers that have not been attached to a window can be deleted in this way.'
