documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dirname` is a command in Unix-based operating systems, used to extract the pathname of a file''s directory. When given a file or a path as an argument, it returns the string representing the directory that contains the file. If the argument is a simple file and not an absolute path, the command uses the current working directory by default. In this way, `dirname` helps navigate directories and manipulate file paths in a Unix environment.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `dirname --help` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems, specifically in the GNU Core Utilities package. It displays help information about the `dirname` utility. When you run `dirname --help`, it will output detailed information on how to use the `dirname` command, including its syntax, available options, and examples of usage. This can be useful for understanding how to effectively utilize the `dirname` command in various situations to extract the directory name from a file path.'
        version: '[AI] `dirname --version` is a command used in Unix-based operating systems to display the version information of the `dirname` utility. The `dirname` command extracts the directory name from a file path. When followed by `--version`, it returns only the version number and other relevant details, such as compilation timestamp, OS, and other build information. It helps users check for updates or confirm the installed version of this particular command.'
        zero: |-
            [AI] The `dirname --zero` command is a variant of the `dirname` utility in Unix-based systems. Its primary function is to extract the directory path component from a given file path, leaving out the filename and extension.

            The `--zero` flag (also known as the null directories flag) is used to ensure that trailing slashes in the output are removed and empty components of a directory path are represented by a single `.` instead of an empty string. This ensures consistency when dealing with paths containing empty or multiple-level directories.
