documentation:
    command: '[AI] `conda compare` is a command in Anaconda''s Conda package manager used to show the differences between two specified environments or packages. The command provides information on added, removed, or modified files and dependencies, helping users understand the changes before merging or applying updates to their environments.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] `conda compare` is a command in Anaconda''s Conda packaging and dependency management system. The `--help` option, when used with this command, provides information about how to use `conda compare` for comparing two conda environments or packages. It explains options like specifying the source environments or packages to compare, displaying differences in packages and dependencies, and the output formats available.'
        json: '[AI] `conda compare --json` is a command in Anaconda''s Conda packaging system. It compares two environments (specified by their Conda env names or paths) and generates a JSON output detailing the differences between them. The JSON output includes keys such as "prefixes", "additions", "removals", and "modifications" that specify changes in packages, dependencies, and other environment settings. This command is useful for understanding what will be installed when merging or creating new environments based on existing ones.'
        name: '[AI] The `conda compare --name` command is a function in Anaconda''s Conda package manager used to compare and show the differences between two specific conda environments or packages. When run, it displays the names of the added or removed packages and environments between the specified conditions. This can help users understand the changes made when creating new environments or updating existing ones.'
        prefix: '[AI] `conda compare --prefix` is a command used in Anaconda and Miniconda environments to compare and show the differences between two conda environments with the same prefix (base installation location). The command lists the packages that will be added, removed, or changed if one environment is updated to match the other. This can help identify and prevent potential conflicts before making changes.'
        quiet: '[AI] `conda compare --quiet` is a command in Anaconda''s conda package manager. It compares two environments (specified by file paths or names) and outputs only the differences between them in a quiet mode, which means it suppresses non-essential messages during execution. This command can be used to identify the packages that need to be added or removed when updating or syncing environments.'
        verbose: '[AI] `conda compare --verbose` is a command used in Anaconda''s conda package and environment management system. This command compares two environments (specified by their paths or names) and shows detailed information about their differences. The `--verbose` flag increases the level of output, providing more information about each change. It lists added, removed, and modified packages along with their new and previous versions.'
