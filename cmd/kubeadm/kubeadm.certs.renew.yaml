description: Renew certificates for a Kubernetes cluster
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew` is a command used to regenerate TLS certificates for various components of a Kubernetes cluster managed by `kubeadm`. It is typically run periodically to ensure the security of the cluster, as letting certificates expire can leave the cluster vulnerable. The command updates the certificates for the etcd, kube-apiserver, and kubelet components. Once renewed, it''s important to update the Kubernetes configuration files (e.g., `kubeconfig`) to use the new certificates.'
