documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `gh gpg-key add` command is used in GitHub (gh) CLI to import a GPG key into your local GPG keyring. This allows you to sign and verify commits with that specific key when pushing or pulling changes from a GitHub repository. You need to provide the path to the key file while using this command. For instance, `gh gpg-key add /path/to/yourkey.gpg`.'
    flag:
        title: '[AI] The `gh` command with the option `gpg-key add` is used to add a new GPG key to your GitHub account. The `--title` option sets the title for the key, which can be descriptive and help identify the key in the GitHub interface or other tools that use the key. When adding a key with `gh`, you would typically provide the key file in a separate command, like so: `gh auth login --local <key-file>` followed by `gh gpg-key add --title "My Key" <key-id>`. Here, `<key-file>` is the local file containing your GPG private key, and `<key-id>` is the unique identifier for the public part of the key.'
