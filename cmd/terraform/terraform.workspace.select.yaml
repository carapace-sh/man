documentation:
    command: '[AI] `terraform workspace select` is a Terraform CLI command used to change the active workspace in your Terraform configuration. Workspaces allow you to manage multiple sets of resources, each with its own unique configuration. By providing the name or number of the desired workspace as an argument, this command helps you switch between different workspaces and apply infrastructure changes specific to that workspace.'

            [AI] The `terraform workspace select` or `create` command is used in Terraform, an infrastructure as code tool, to manage multiple working directories called workspaces within a single Terraform configuration.

            * `workspace select <name>`: This command sets the active workspace to the specified name. It's used when you already have a workspace with the desired name.
            * `workspace create <new_name>`: This command creates a new workspace with the given name. If a workspace with that name already exists, an error message will be displayed.

            By using workspaces, you can easily manage multiple configurations (environments) of your infrastructure, like development, staging, and production, in one Terraform configuration file.
