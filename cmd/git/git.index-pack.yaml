documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git index-pack` is a Git command that performs packing of index data into a single file, which can be later used for transfer or storage. This command is usually run in the background during a Git push or pull operation to reduce network traffic and save bandwidth by sending only the necessary index pack files instead of individual commits and their associated data. Once received, the index packs are applied using `git apply-index-pack` or automatically when cloning or fetching with Git.'
