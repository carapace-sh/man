description: Disconnect devices
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nmcli` (NetworkManager Command-Line Interface) `device disconnect` command is used to disconnect a network connection managed by NetworkManager in Linux systems. When issued without any arguments, it affects the currently active connection on the default device (usually wired or wireless). If a specific connection name or device identifier is provided as an argument, then only that particular connection will be disconnected. This command can be useful when you want to temporarily disable a network connection, for instance, during software updates or security assessments.'
