documentation:
    command: '[AI] `supervisord` is a cross-platform process monitoring application and init system for Unix-based systems. It allows users to start, stop, and monitor background processes, as well as automatically restart them if they fail. Supervisor also provides a web interface for managing the processes. The configuration file (often named `supervisord.conf`) is used to define the programs and their properties such as user, environment variables, and start commands. The supervisor can be run as a background service or started manually.'
    flag:
        childlogdir: '[AI] `supervisord` is a process monitoring tool in Python designed to keep a specific set of processes running in the background. The option `--childlogdir` specifies the directory where the log files for child processes (processes managed by `supervisord`) will be stored. This allows easy centralization and organization of logs related to supervised processes.'
        configuration: '[AI] `supervisord --configuration` is a command used in the Supervisor process control system to start Supervisor with a specific configuration file. The `--configuration` option allows you to specify a custom configuration file instead of using the default one. When you run this command followed by the path to your configuration file, Supervisor will read and apply the settings defined in that file, managing and monitoring your services accordingly.'
        directory: '[AI] `supervisord --directory` is a command-line argument used with the Supervisor process control system in Linux and Unix environments. This option specifies the directory where Supervisor configuration files (in `.conf` format) are located. The Supervisor daemon reads these files to manage and monitor the specified processes or services, ensuring they run correctly and are restarted if they fail.'
        help: '[AI] `supervisord --help` is a command used to display help information about the Supervisor process control system in Python. Supervisor is a daemon that starts and stops processes on Unix-based systems based on predefined configuration files, ensuring their continuity even if the main application crashes or is terminated. The `--help` option provides a detailed explanation of available options and usage for the Supervisor control interface (supervisord), allowing users to understand how to interact with it effectively.'
        identifier: '[AI] `supervisord --identifier` is a command-line option for Supervisor, a process monitoring system. The option sets a unique identifier for processes managed by Supervisor. By specifying an identifier, it becomes easier to distinguish and manage specific processes in the Supervisor configuration file or via Supervisor''s control interface.'
        logfile: '[AI] `supervisord` is a popular system service management tool in Linux environments. The option `--logfile` is used to specify a file where `supervisord` will write its log messages. This allows users to centrally monitor and review the logs of their managed services for troubleshooting or audit purposes. When started with this flag, `supervisord` writes its output to the specified file instead of the default standard output (stdout) or error output (stderr).'
        logfile_backups: '[AI] `supervisord` is a process monitoring tool in Python, often used for managing background services in various systems. The option `--logfile-backups` creates backup logs when Supervisor rotates log files. This means that older log files are kept and new ones are added, allowing users to keep track of previous logs without losing important data.'
        logfile_maxbytes: '[AI] The `--logfile_maxbytes` option in the Supervisor process monitoring tool sets a limit for the size of log files generated by Supervisor. When a log file reaches this size, Supervisor will rotate the log files by renaming the current log file with a timestamp suffix and creating a new log file to continue logging events. This helps prevent log files from growing too large and taking up excessive disk space.'
        loglevel: |-
            [AI] `supervisord` is a popular system utility used for managing background processes in various Unix-based systems. The `--loglevel` option sets the logging level for Supervisor's output, controlling the verbosity of messages it displays in its logs.

            Higher log levels correspond to more detailed information:

            1. `ERROR`: Only shows critical errors that prevent Supervisor from functioning properly.
            2. `WARN`: Displays warning messages that indicate potential issues but do not cause a service to be stopped or an error to occur.
            3. `INFO`: Shows general informational messages, such as when services start and stop. This is the default log level.
            4. `DEBUG`: Provides more detailed debugging information for developers and troubleshooters.
            5. `TRACE`: Logs every action Supervisor takes, including internal system calls. This log level is typically used by developers for advanced debugging purposes.

            To set the log level when starting Supervisor, use a command like this:
            ```bash
            supervisord -l /path/to/logfile.log --loglevel=DEBUG
            ```
            This example starts Supervisor and sets its logging level to `DEBUG`. Replace `/path/to/logfile.log` with the desired log file path for the logs to be saved there.
        minfds: '[AI] `supervisord` is a process monitoring tool that ensures the availability of services in the background. The `--minfds` option is a configuration setting for Supervisor. It specifies the minimum number of open file descriptors that a process can have to be considered running by Supervisor. If a process uses fewer file descriptors than specified, Supervisor will consider it unresponsive and may restart it.'
        minprocs: '[AI] `supervisord` is a popular system monitoring tool for Unix-based systems. The `--minprocs` option is a configuration parameter used in its `supervisor.conf` file. This option sets the minimum number of processes that a program must have to be considered running. If the number of processes falls below this value, Supervisord will attempt to restart the process. By setting an appropriate minimum number, system administrators can ensure that critical services remain operational and available to users.'
        nocleanup: '[AI] `supervisord --nocleanup` is a command-line option used with Supervisor, a popular process monitoring tool for Linux and Unix systems. This option disables Supervisor''s automatic removal of unused or failed processes from its managed list. In other words, it prevents Supervisor from cleaning up its records and keeps all monitored processes in the configuration files. It can be useful when troubleshooting or if you want to keep a large number of processes that might not normally persist.'
        nodaemon: '[AI] `supervisord` is a Process Control System (PCS) in Python designed to keep a specified set of processes running in the background, even if the originating terminal session is closed. The option `--nodaemon` instructs Supervisor not to daemonize itself during startup. This means that Supervisor runs as an interactive process instead of a background process and can be controlled via its command-line interface. This flag is useful for debugging or when you want to monitor the logs in real-time, as it keeps the output in the terminal.'
        pidfile: '[AI] `supervisord` is a popular process monitoring tool for initiating and managing background processes in various operating systems, including Linux. The `--pidfile` option is used to specify a file where `supervisord` should write the Process ID (PID) of the master `supervisord` process it starts. This allows users or other applications to locate the running instance of `supervisord`, enabling better control and management over its lifecycle.'
        profile_options: |-
            [AI] `supervisord` is a process monitoring tool in Python, which helps manage and start background processes as services. The option `--profile_options` is used to configure specific profiling settings for Supervisor.

            When you run `supervisord` with the `--profile_options` flag, it enables the collection of performance data using various profiling tools like cProfile or line_profiler. This data helps analyze and optimize the performance of your applications or services.

            For example, if you want to profile a service named 'my_service', you can use a configuration file like:

            ```
            [program:my_service]
            command = python /path/to/your_script.py
            profile = yes
            profile_options = -k pstats -o profiling_output.prof
            ```

            In this example, the `profile_options` setting specifies to use cProfile and output the profile data in a 'pstats' format into a file named 'profiling_output.prof'. Running `supervisord` with this configuration will start the profiling when your service is running.
        silent: '[AI] `supervisord --silent` is a command used in system administration to run the Supervisor process manager as a background service, with the `--silent` option being used to suppress all output from Supervisor during its operation. This means that Supervisor will start and monitor your services without displaying any messages or logs in the terminal. It''s useful when you want Supervisor to run invisibly in the background, without disturbing other processes or flooding the console with log information.'
        strip_ansi: '[AI] `supervisord` is a popular process monitoring tool for initiating and managing background services in various operating systems. The command `--strip_ansi` is an option used when invoking `supervisord` from the terminal or command line. This option is used to remove ANSI escape sequences from the output, ensuring that the logs produced by `supervisord` are cleanly formatted and easier to parse in text editors and scripting environments. By stripping ANSI codes, the logs will not contain colors or other visual formatting, making them more suitable for automated processing and analysis.'
        umask: '[AI] `supervisord` is a process monitoring tool that keeps a specified set of processes running in the background. The `--umask` option sets the umask (user mask) value for newly created files and directories. An umask is a numeric value defining the default file permissions that will be applied when creating new files or directories. For instance, the value `002` sets the default permission to allow other users to read files but not write or execute them (r--r--w---). By setting `--umask` option, system administrators can customize the file permissions for supervisord''s configuration files and log files according to their preference.'
        user: '[AI] `supervisord --user` is a command used in system administration to start Supervisor, a background process monitoring and management tool, under a specific system user account instead of the default one. This configuration ensures that the Supervisor processes run with the desired level of access and permissions. It helps maintain security and isolate potential issues or errors caused by Supervisor within that particular user environment.'
        version: '[AI] `supervisord --version` is a command used with the Supervisor process control system to check for and display the currently installed Supervisor version number. It does not require any arguments other than the command itself, which is typically run in a terminal or command prompt. The output will display something like "Supervisor v4.1.0" or similar, indicating the major, minor, and sometimes micro version of the software.'
