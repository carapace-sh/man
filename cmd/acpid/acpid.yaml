documentation:
    command: '[AI] `acpid` is a daemon (background process) designed to monitor ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) events on Linux systems. It listens for and responds to these events, allowing other applications to use the ACPI interface in a more convenient way. For instance, it can be used to control suspend/resume functionality or to provide power management information to desktop environments or window managers.'
    flag:
        confdir: '[AI] `acpid` is a system daemon for event-driven automatic adjustment of various system settings based on user actions or hardware events. The option `--confdir` specifies the directory where its configuration files are located. When started, `acpid` reads these files to determine which events and actions to respond to. In summary, `acpid --confdir` sets the directory for `acpid`''s configuration files.'
        dropaction: |-
            [AI] The `--dropaction` option in the `acpid` (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Daemon) command is used to specify an action to take when a power event occurs. The possible values for this option include:

            * `powerbutton`: Perform the default power button press actions. This typically results in a graceful shutdown of the system.
            * `poweroff`: Immediately power off the system.
            * `reboot`: Reboot the system.
            * `suspend`: Suspend the system to disk or RAM.
            * `hibernate`: Hibernate the system to disk.
            * `ignore`: Ignore the power event.
            * `halt`: Immediately halt the system (stop all processes).
            * `kexec`: Use Kexec to load a new kernel image and reboot.
            * `log`: Log the power event without taking any action.

            The option is used as follows in the configuration file of acpid: `event = button /power /lidaction AC_POWER * --dropaction reboot`. This sets the dropaction for the power button event to be a system reboot.
        eventfile: '[AI] `acpid` is a system daemon for monitoring and responding to events from various input devices such as keyboards and mice. The `--eventfile` option tells `acpid` to write event data into a file instead of sending it directly to client applications using IPC (Inter-Process Communication) sockets. This can be useful when you want to log or process the events in a custom way by reading from the file.'
        foreground: '[AI] `acpid --foreground` is a command-line option for the ACPID daemon, which stands for Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Daemon. The `--foreground` option instructs ACPID to run in the foreground instead of as a background process. This means that the script or program will not detach from the terminal and will continue to display output to the console while it is running. In other words, it keeps the control terminal open and doesn''t put itself into the background to run indefinitely. It can be useful when you want to monitor its logs or settings changes in real-time.'
        help: '[AI] `acpid` is a system daemon used for monitoring ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) events on Unix-like operating systems. The `--help` option when used with the `acpid` command displays a brief help message that lists the available command line options for the daemon. Some common options include `--verbose`, which increases the verbosity of the output, and `--event-add`, which allows adding custom event handlers. The help text also explains how to specify event sources and handlers using configuration files or environment variables.'
        lockfile: '[AI] `acpid` is a system daemon that monitors ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) events and can send notifications based on those events. The `--lockfile` option is used to specify a file where `acpid` should write a lock file before starting up. This prevents multiple instances of `acpid` from running at the same time, ensuring that system resources are not unnecessarily consumed. When `acpid` exits, it deletes the lock file automatically.'
        logevents: '[AI] `acpid` is a system daemon that monitors ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) events and can send notifications based on those events to other applications. The `--logevents` option is used to enable logging of specific event types in the acpid message log. This option takes one or more event IDs as arguments, and the daemon will log messages only for those specified events, providing more detailed information about the occurrence of these events in the system.'
        netlink: '[AI] `acpid` is a daemon that monitors ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) events and communicates them to applications using various methods, including Netlink. The `--netlink` option tells `acpid` to use the Netlink protocol for inter-process communication between the kernel and user space. This allows applications to subscribe to specific ACPI event notifications and receive real-time updates on power management events, such as display off, lid close, or battery discharge.'
        nosocket: '[AI] `acpid` is a system daemon used to monitor ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) events and signal related applications. The `--nosocket` option is passed as an argument when starting `acpid`. This flag disables the use of Unix domain sockets for communication between `acpid` and client applications. Instead, it uses traditional IPC (Inter-Process Communication) methods like FIFOs or pipes to exchange data. This might be useful in certain situations where socket communication is restricted or not desired.'
        pidfile: '[AI] `acpid` is a daemon that monitors ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) events to enable advanced power management in X Windows System. The option `--pidfile` tells `acpid` to create and use a process identifier file. This means that the PID (process identification number) of the running `acpid` instance will be saved in a specified file, allowing other processes or system components to identify and interact with it if needed.'
        socketfile: '[AI] `acpid` is a daemon that monitors ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) events and notifies applications about them in real time. The option `--socketfile` specifies the Unix domain socket file where `acpid` listens for incoming connections from client applications. When this option is used, `acpid` creates or binds to the specified socket file on start-up, allowing clients to connect and receive notifications about ACPI events. This method of communication between `acpid` and client applications provides a robust and efficient way to exchange real-time information.'
        socketgroup: '[AI] `acpid` is a system daemon designed to monitor ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) events and signal corresponding actions, such as suspending or hibernating a system based on user-defined rules. The `--socketgroup` option is used to configure Unix domain sockets for inter-process communication. With this option, multiple instances of acpid can be run in the same system, communicating via shared sockets, making it possible to define different power rules for various components or users. This improves the flexibility and robustness of the system''s power management.'
        socketmode: '[AI] `acpid` is a daemon for Linux systems that monitors ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) events and can send X11 signals in response to certain events, such as lid closure or battery discharge. The `--socketmode` option is used to configure acpid to listen on a Unix domain socket instead of a TCP port. This allows other processes on the same system to interact with acpid by sending messages to the socket. This can be useful in a multi-process setup where different components need to communicate with acpid for power management purposes.'
        tpmutefix: '[AI] `acpid` is a system daemon that monitors ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) events and sends X11 signals in response. The command `acpid --tpms-tiefix` is used to disable TPM (Trusted Platform Module) related power management events in acpid. This can be useful when the system does not have a TPM or if there are issues with TPM power management causing unexpected system behavior or power consumption.'
        version: '[AI] `acpid --version` is a command used in Linux systems to check the version information of the ACPID daemon, which stands for Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Daemon. This software monitors ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) events and can be used to provide power management functionality for X11 window managers or desktop environments. When you run `acpid --version`, it will display the version number of the installed ACPID daemon, along with any additional build information such as compilation date or commit hash.'
