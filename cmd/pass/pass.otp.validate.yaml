    command: '[AI] The `pass otp validate` command in Pass, a password manager, is used to check the validity of a One-Time Password (OTP) token. When you save an account that uses two-factor authentication in Pass, it can store the OTP secret key and generate tokens based on it. However, if you manually enter or receive an OTP token, you can use `pass otp validate` to confirm its validity without having to log into the account. This command takes an OTP secret key file and a token as arguments and returns true if the token is valid.'
