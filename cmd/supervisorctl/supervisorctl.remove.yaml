documentation:
    command: '[AI] `supervisorctl` is a utility used to control the Supervisor process manager. The `remove` command is used to stop and remove a specific process managed by Supervisor. It takes the name or ID of the process as an argument, for example: `supervisorctl remove my_process`. This command will stop the process first and then remove it from the configuration file, so it won''t be automatically started again on system reboot.'
