documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `strings` command is a common utility in Unix-like operating systems used for extracting printable strings from binary files. It reads input data, interprets sequences of bytes as possible format-specific strings (ASCII, Unicode, etc.), and writes them to standard output. This can be helpful for analyzing unknown or suspect binary files, such as those obtained from malware or reverse engineering.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] The `strings --all` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems used for searching for strings of printable characters within binary files. The `--all` option tells the tool to output each occurrence of a string followed by its offset and file position, making it useful for locating specific sequences in large binary data.'
        bytes: |-
            [AI] The `strings --bytes` command is a filter or utility in various Unix-like operating systems, including GNU CoreUtils. It searches an input for strings of consecutive bytes that match a specified encoding or format, such as ASCII, UTF-8, or hexadecimal.

            The `--bytes` option tells the `strings` command to display output in raw bytes rather than decoding it into human-readable strings. This can be useful when working with binary files or data, allowing you to examine specific byte sequences directly.
        data: '[AI] The `strings --data` command is a utility in GNU CoreUtils used to extract strings of printable characters from binary files or inputs. When used with the `--data` option, it reads the input as a binary file instead of its standard input stream and outputs the extracted strings directly to the terminal without any context information such as offsets or filenames.'
        encoding: '[AI] The `strings --encoding` command is a utility in GNU Coreutils, used to extract strings of printable characters from binary files. The `--encoding` option specifies the expected encoding for the extracted strings. It can be set to various values like "ascii", "utf-8", or "latin1" among others. This helps ensure correct interpretation and decoding of the extracted strings.'
        help: '[AI] `strings --help` is a command-line utility in various Unix-like operating systems used to search for and print out strings of contiguous bytes in binary files. The `--help` option displays detailed usage information, including a brief description of the command, options it supports, their meanings, and examples of how they can be used.'
        include-all-whitespace: '[AI] The `strings --include-all-whitespace` command is a filter used in Unix-based systems to extract strings of printable characters from binary files. The `--include-all-whitespace` option extends this functionality by including strings that contain all types of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) in the output. Without this option, only strings without leading or trailing whitespace would be printed.'
        o: '[AI] The `strings -o` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems, specifically the `strings` tool. The `-o` option (also known as the --output-file option) instructs the tool to write matched strings directly to the standard output stream rather than displaying them on the terminal, making it suitable for further processing by other commands or scripts. It is often used in data analysis and reverse engineering to extract readable text from binary files.'
        output-separator: '[AI] The `strings --output-separator` command is a utility in GNU Coreutils used for extracting strings of printable characters from binary files. The `--output-separator` option specifies the character to be used as a separator between extracted strings when printing them to standard output or a file. This can be useful when dealing with large numbers of strings and wanting to easily parse the output later.'
        print-file-name: '[AI] The `strings --print-file-name` command is a utility from the GNU Coreutils package used for searching for strings of data within binary files. The option `--print-file-name` causes the name of the file from which each string was found to be printed along with the string itself. This helps identify the origin of each occurring string in the output.'
        radix: |-
            [AI] The `--radix` option in the `strings` command is used to specify the base or radix of the hexadecimal numbers that `strings` will display. By default, `strings` assumes a hexadecimal radix of 16. However, you can use `--radix` to change this.

            For example, if you want `strings` to display numbers in base 8 (octal), you would use the command `strings --radix=8 file`. Similarly, for base 10 (decimal), use `strings --radix=10 file`, and for base 16 (hexadecimal), use `strings file`.

            This option is useful when dealing with files that contain numbers in various bases. It helps ensure that the output of `strings` matches the expected format, making it easier to analyze the results.
        target: '[AI] The `strings --target` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems, specifically part of the GNU Core Utilities. It is used to search for and extract strings (sequences of characters) from binary files. The `--target` option specifies the byte sequence pattern to search for in the binary file. This flag is particularly useful when looking for specific text or data that may be encoded within the binary, such as ASCII-encoded strings or custom formats. For instance, you could use it to find a specific configuration string in a compiled program.'
        version: '[AI] The `strings --version` command is used to display the version information of the `strings` utility, which is a common Unix or Linux command-line tool for extracting readable strings from binary files. When you run this command in your terminal, it will print out the specific version number and other relevant details about the installed `strings` implementation. This can be helpful for checking if you have the latest version or for troubleshooting issues related to the `strings` tool.'
