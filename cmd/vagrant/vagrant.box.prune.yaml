documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant box prune` command is used to remove unused Vagrant boxes from your local machine. Vagrant boxes are pre-prepared environments that contain all the software, configurations, and dependencies needed for a particular project. By running this command, you can clean up your local Vagrant installation by removing any boxes that are no longer being used in your Vagrantfiles or projects, freeing up disk space and reducing download times for future box installations.'
    flag:
        dry-run: '[AI] The `vagrant box prune --dry-run` command is used to perform a dry run of the `box prune` operation in Vagrant without actually deleting any boxes. This means that Vagrant will simulate the removal of unused boxes based on the current configuration, and report which boxes would be deleted without actually deleting them from your local system or the Vagrant Cloud. This can help you understand the impact of the `box prune` command before executing it in a production environment.'
        force: '[AI] `vagrant box prune --force` is a Vagrant command used to remove unused and abandoned Vagrant boxes from your local directory. The `--force` option is used to delete boxes even if they are currently in use by one or more Vagrant projects, without asking for confirmation. This command helps keep your local Vagrant environment clean and efficient by eliminating unused boxes and reducing disk space consumption.'
        keep-active-boxes: '[AI] The `vagrant box prune` command is used to remove unused Vagrant boxes from your local machine. The `--keep-active-boxes` option tells Vagrant to keep the boxes that are currently in use by your Vagrant projects. With this option, only the boxes that are not being used will be removed. This helps to keep your local Vagrant environment tidy while ensuring that you don''t accidentally delete a box that is still in use.'
        name: '[AI] The `vagrant box prune --name` command is used to remove Vagrant boxes with a specified name from the local Vagrant cache. The `prune` action instructs Vagrant to delete unused and outdated boxes, while `--name` allows specifying the name of the box(es) to be removed explicitly.'
        provider: '[AI] The `vagrant box prune --provider <name>` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for building and managing virtual machines, to remove unused and outdated boxes (pre-configured virtual machine images) for the specified provider. Providers define how Vagrant interacts with various platforms such as VirtualBox or VMware. By running this command, you can keep your local Vagrant environment lean and efficient by only retaining the boxes required for your projects.'
