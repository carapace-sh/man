description: replace identical files in the store by hard links
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `nix store optimize` is a Nix package manager command used to reduce the size of installed Nix packages by removing unnecessary duplicated data. This command creates hard links between identical files, maintaining multiple versions of a package but saving disk space by storing only one copy of the common data. Additionally, it deletes unused cache files and unlinks broken symlinks. Overall, it ensures an efficient usage of storage while keeping all installed Nix packages.'
