documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nix store prefetch-file` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command fetches a file from its source location and stores it in the Nix store, which is a cache of packages and their dependencies. By using this command, users can ensure that they have the latest version of a specific file without having to build or install the entire package that contains it. It''s an efficient way to manage and update individual files while minimizing disk space usage.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `nix store prefetch-file` is a command from Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command is used to fetch and cache the output of a build or installation of a specific package into the local Nix store. The `--debug` flag enables debug mode, which provides more detailed output and error messages during the fetching process.'
        executable: |-
            [AI] The `nix store prefetch-file` command is a part of Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This specific command is used to download and prepare a file for installation as an executable.

            The `--executable` flag tells the command that the file being fetched is an executable, which means it's a program or script that can be run directly without needing additional setup. The Nix package manager uses this information to properly configure the file's permissions and set up any necessary dependencies or environment variables for it to run correctly once installed.

            When you run `nix store prefetch-file <path-to-file> --executable`, Nix downloads the file from its remote repositories, checks its checksum for authenticity, and caches it in the local Nix store. The `--executable` flag tells Nix that this file is an executable, so it will be given the appropriate permissions and prepared for installation with other dependencies if needed.

            This command is often used during the development of a custom configuration or when installing packages not available in the default Nix repositories to ensure proper handling and execution of the files.
        expected-hash: '[AI] The `nix store prefetch-file` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It downloads and caches the content of a file from a Nix expression or URL, which is identified by an expected hash value. The `--expected-hash` option specifies this hash value, ensuring that only the exact matched data is fetched and stored in the Nix store. This helps maintain the reproducibility and integrity of Nix packages.'
        hash-type: |-
            [AI] The `nix store prefetch-file` command is a utility provided by Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This command allows fetching a specific file from the Nix expression language or repository using its hash value, which ensures getting an exact version of the file.

            The `--hash-type` option specifies the type of hash to use when identifying the file. Commonly used hash types include SHA256, SHA1, and MD5. For instance, if you want to fetch a file with a SHA256 hash value starting with "abcdef...", you would run:

            ```bash
            nix store prefetch-file <hash> --hash-type sha256
            ```

            This command downloads the file with the specified hash and makes it available in the Nix store, allowing the system to use or reference the file in subsequent builds or configurations.
        json: '[AI] The `nix store prefetch-file --json` command is a utility in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. It fetches the JSON metadata of a specific file or a group of files from the Nix expression language repository. This metadata includes details such as the file''s size, checksum, and dependencies. By using this command with the `--json` flag, you obtain an output in the JSON format that can be further processed by other scripts or tools.'
        log-format: |-
            [AI] The `nix store prefetch-file` command is a utility provided by Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. This command is used to download and cache the metadata of a specific package or file from the Nix expressions server, allowing faster installation and updates in the future.

            The option `--log-format` specifies the format of the log output generated during the prefetching process. It can be set to "brief" (the default) for minimal output, or "json" for a more detailed and machine-readable format. The logs contain information about the progress and results of the prefetching operation.
        name: '[AI] The `nix store prefetch-file --name` command is used in the Nix Package Manager to download and cache metadata for a specific package before installing it. The `--name` option specifies the name of the package. The output of this command will be a file containing the metadata for that package, which can then be used to verify its integrity or extract additional information about the package. This can help improve performance by reducing network traffic and disk I/O during package installation.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] The `nix store prefetch-file` command with the `--print-build-logs` option is a Nix expression used to retrieve the build logs for a specific file or package that has already been built and stored in the Nix store. When you run `nix build` to construct a package, its build log is saved and indexed within the Nix store, allowing you to access it later via this command. The output of `--print-build-logs` will be the build log text for the requested file or package.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `nix store prefetch-file` command with the `--quiet` flag is used in Nix Pakages Manager to fetch and download the build inputs for a specific package, without displaying any progress messages or output. In other words, it performs the downloading process silently. This can be useful when running automated scripts or building packages in a headless environment.'
        verbose: '[AI] The `nix store prefetch-file --verbose` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems, to retrieve metadata about a specific file from the Nix store. The `prefetch-file` option fetches the file metadata if it''s not already available locally. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output information displayed during the command execution. In essence, this command retrieves detailed information about a file in the Nix store.'
