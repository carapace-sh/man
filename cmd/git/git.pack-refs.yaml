documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git pack-refs` is a Git command used to create and update `.pack` files that store packed refs, which are compact, flat, on-disk representations of multiple refs. These packed refs can be shared among users or stored in remote repositories for efficient reference transfer. When run without any arguments, it creates new pack files based on the current refs; with an argument, it updates existing pack files. It helps in reducing network bandwidth usage and disk space by bundling multiple refs into a single file.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `git pack-refs --all` is a Git command used to create and update packed refs in a repository. Packed refs are an offline representation of references, allowing faster access to them without needing to contact the remote server. The `--all` option tells Git to process all local refs as well as those that are configured to be fetched (remote tracking refs). This command helps improve performance and reduce network usage in large repositories by keeping frequently accessed refs locally packed.'
        exclude: '[AI] `git pack-refs` is a Git command used to create a compact, archive-format representation of refs (references to commit hashes) and their associated metadata. The `--exclude` option allows you to exclude specific refs from being packed. This can be useful when dealing with large repositories or when only a subset of refs is required for a particular task. By specifying a ref or a pattern using this option, Git will not include those refs in the pack file that''s generated.'
        include: '[AI] The `git pack-refs` command with the `--include` option is used to create a packed ref file, which is a compressed archive containing all the local branch and tag references. The `--include` argument specifies that only the named references (branches or tags) should be included in the packed ref file. This can help reduce the size of the pack file by excluding unwanted references.'
        prune: '[AI] `git pack-refs --prune` is a Git command used to transfer and delete unreachable refs from one repository to another over a Rsync-like transport, such as HTTP or SSH. The command fetches and deletes any remote references (branches or tags) that do not exist locally and have no corresponding commits in the local repository. This helps keep both repositories in sync by removing stale references.'
