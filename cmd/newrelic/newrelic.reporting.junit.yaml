documentation:
    command: '[AI] "newrelic reporting junit" is a command used in New Relic''s agent installation for Java applications. It generates JUnit test reports in XML format, which can be uploaded to the New Relic platform for detailed performance testing analysis and reporting. This helps developers identify issues and improve application performance.'
    flag:
        dryRun: '[AI] `newrelic reporting junit --dryRun` is a command used with New Relic''s Java Agent to generate a JUnit report of unit test coverage and performance data, without actually executing the tests or making any changes to the application. The `--dryRun` option is used to simulate the execution and provide an output that would be generated in a real run, allowing users to review the information beforehand and make necessary adjustments if needed.'
        output: '[AI] The `newrelic reporting junit --output` command is used with the New Relic agent for Java applications to generate and report JUnit test results to the New Relic RPM (Real User Monitoring) product. When executed, it processes any JUnit test results found in the local system''s output directories and sends them to New Relic for further analysis and display within the New Relic RPM dashboard. This command can help developers and testers monitor the performance and reliability of their Java applications by visualizing test coverage, identifying trends, and detecting potential issues in real-time.'
        path: '[AI] `newrelic reporting junit --path` is a command used in New Relic''s agent for Java applications to generate and report JUnit test results to the New Relic platform. The `--path` option specifies the directory or file containing the JUnit test results XML files, which are generated during the execution of JUnit tests in the application. This command helps in monitoring and tracking the performance and coverage of the JUnit tests, enhancing the overall software development and testing process in the New Relic dashboard.'
