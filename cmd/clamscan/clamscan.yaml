documentation:
    command: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line tool used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software suite. It performs a deep scan of files and directories to check for viruses and other malware. The scanned data is sent to the ClamAV virus definition files (signatures) for comparison. Scanning can be performed recursively on entire directories or specific files. Results may include file names, paths, virus names, and scan status.'
    flag:
        alert-broken: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner for ClamAV. The option `--alert-broken` is used to enable the generation of error messages when ClamAV''s database files (used by clamscan for virus definition checks) are corrupted or not accessible. This helps in identifying and resolving issues related to the ClamAV database, ensuring accurate and effective scanning results.'
        alert-broken-media: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner tool for the ClamAV antivirus engine. The option `--alert-broken-media` instructs `clamscan` to emit an alert when it encounters a file or media that cannot be fully scanned due to access permissions issues or other read errors. This flag helps in identifying potential security risks represented by unreadable files and media, enhancing the overall system security.'
        alert-encrypted: '[AI] The `clamscan` command is a tool from the Clam Antivirus software for scanning files and directories for viruses and malware. The option `--alert-encrypted` is used to specifically identify and flag encrypted files during a scan. When this option is set, `clamscan` will report any file that appears to be encrypted but does not have a recognized encryption header or metadata. It''s important to note that this option may also produce false positives for files with legitimate encryption like encrypted disks, compressed files or archives, and other non-malicious encrypted data. The output will include a message similar to: `[--] SCANNING: /path/to/file` followed by the encryption detection result.'
        alert-encrypted-archive: '[AI] The command `clamscan --alert-encrypted-archive` is used with ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software. The option `--alert-encrypted-archive` tells ClamAV to raise an alert when it detects a file that is possibly an encrypted archive, such as a ZIP or RAR file with an unknown password. This can be useful in identifying potentially malicious files that may be hidden within encrypted archives. The alert does not decrypt the archive; instead, it indicates that further investigation is required to determine if the file contains a threat.'
        alert-encrypted-doc: '[AI] `clamscan` is a free and open-source antivirus scanner from the ClamAV project. The command `clamscan --alert-encrypted-docs` tells the clamscan tool to perform a scan and raise an alert for any detected encrypted documents. Encrypted files are not necessarily malicious, but they may hide viruses or other malware. This option helps system administrators identify and investigate potentially sensitive encrypted files on their systems.'
        alert-exceeds-max: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner for the ClamAV system. The option `--alert-exceeds-max` configures clamscan to produce an alert when the number of detected virus instances exceeds a specified maximum limit. This can help administrators quickly identify systems or files that may have a large number of viruses, potentially indicating a more serious security issue.'
        alert-macros: |-
            [AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner from the ClamAV software. The `--alert-macros` option modifies the way `clamscan` outputs alert messages.

            Instead of using default messages for detected threats, `--alert-macros` allows you to define custom messages or macros for each threat detection. These messages can include variables that represent details about the detected threat. This feature helps in automating responses based on specific detections and makes scanning reports more informative and actionable.
        alert-partition-intersection: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner for the ClamAV engine. The option `--alert-partition-intersection` is used to enable an alert when scanning multiple partitions or volumes intersect, meaning there are files in common between them that were scanned before and have been detected as potential threats. This can help identify potentially infected files across multiple storage devices or partitions.'
        alert-phishing-cloak: '[AI] The `clamscan` command with the option `--alert-phishing-cloak` is used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus solution. This specific option enables the phishing signature database and sets the alert level for phishing detections to "WARNING" or "CLAMALERT". When a file is scanned and found to contain phishing content, the system issues an alert with the term "phishing-cloak", signifying that potential phishing attempts may be present in the file. This option helps protect against social engineering attacks, such as those delivered through emails or malicious websites, making it an essential tool for securing systems and networks.'
        alert-phishing-ssl: '[AI] The `clamscan` command with the option `--alert-phishing-ssl` is used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software suite. This specific option is designed to help identify and flag potentially malicious SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificates that are associated with phishing websites. Phishing attacks aim to trick users into revealing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or financial data. By scanning for such SSL certificates, `clamscan` can assist in protecting against such threats and enhance overall system security.'
        allmatch: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner from the ClamAV software suite. The option `--allmatch` or `-a` tells ClamAV to search for files matching a specific pattern in the file system, rather than scanning individual files. It takes a regular expression as an argument and returns a list of files that match the pattern. For example, `clamscan --allmatch /path/to/regex.*/` would scan the entire file system under the given path for files with names matching the regex pattern.'
        archive-verbose: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner tool from the ClamAV antivirus engine. The option `--archive-verbose` is used when scanning tar or other archive files. It produces a detailed report of each scanned file within the archive, including the file name, size, and scan result (infected or clean) for each file. This helps in identifying any potential threats hidden within archives and provides better visibility into the scanning process.'
        bell: '[AI] `clamscan --bell` is a command used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software suite. The option `--bell` causes ClamAV to ring the system bell or beep when it detects a virus in a scanned file. This alert helps users know that a potential security issue has been identified and should investigate further.'
        bytecode: '[AI] `clamscan --bytecode` is a command-line option used with ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software. This option instructs ClamAV to scan files using bytecode analysis instead of virus definition files (VDPs). Bytecode analysis examines the machine code directly without relying on signatures, providing an additional layer of detection against unknown or zero-day threats. It requires more computational resources and time compared to VDP scanning but offers enhanced security.'
        bytecode-timeout: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV. The option `--bytecode-timeout` sets a timeout for analyzing Microsoft Office Macros with unknown or suspected malicious content. If ClamAV detects a macro during a scan, it will attempt to analyze the code inside the macro using its built-in emulator. However, some complex macros may take a long time to analyze. The `--bytecode-timeout` option allows you to set a limit for how long ClamAV should spend on analyzing each macro before moving on to the next file or terminating the scan. By default, there is no timeout. Setting this option can help prevent scans from getting stuck on a single file.'
        bytecode-unsigned: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV. The option `--bytecode-unsigned` modifies the way ClamAV analyzes files with Bytecode virus signatures. It tells ClamAV to treat unsigned bytecode (i.e., bytecode without an explicit endianness marking) as big-endian, potentially improving scan performance for certain types of files, such as Java class files or executable binaries from some systems. This option may lead to false positives or negatives depending on the actual data in the file and its expected format.'
        copy: '[AI] `clamscan --copy` is a command-line utility from ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software. This option tells ClamAV to scan files and, if they''re detected as infected, to copy those infected files to a quarantine directory instead of deleting them immediately. The original files remain untouched during the scanning process. This allows administrators to review the flagged files before deciding on further actions, such as permanent deletion or restoration.'
        cross-fs: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner tool for the ClamAV antivirus engine. The option `--cross-fs` enables ClamAV to scan multiple filesystems or mount points in a single scan. This flag allows ClamAV to traverse directories and subdirectories across file system boundaries, making it useful when scanning large or complex systems with multiple partitions or mounted volumes. It is important to note that the targeted file systems must be properly configured for ClamAV to access them, such as being mounted or correctly identified in the `/etc/fstab` file.'
        database: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line tool used for scanning files and directories for viruses using the Clam Antivirus engine. The option `--database` specifies the location of the ClamAV database files, which are necessary for virus definition updates. When you use this option, you''re instructing clamscan to use that specific database to check the scanned files against the latest virus definitions available in the specified database.'
        debug: '[AI] `clamscan --debug` is a command used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software. The `--debug` option enables more detailed output during a scan, providing extra information about the scanning process and detected threats. This can be helpful for troubleshooting, understanding how ClamAV identifies viruses or malware, and for gaining insight into its functionality.'
        detect-pua: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner tool for Unix systems, developed by the ClamAV project. The option `--detect-pua` is used to enable heuristic analysis during a scan. Heuristics are rules that help detect unknown or obfuscated malware based on their behavior and characteristics, rather than comparing against known virus definitions. With this option, clamscan will analyze files for potential threats using heuristic analysis in addition to scanning against the ClamAV signature database.'
        detect-structured: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner tool from the ClamAV antivirus engine. The option `--detect-structured` is used to enable structured virus definition files (LDIF format) scanning in addition to the regular signature-based scanning. Structured scanning allows for more flexible and detailed virus definitions, including support for heuristic detection and multiple engine scanning. This can provide better protection against new or unknown threats that may not have a traditional signature yet.'
        disable-cache: '[AI] `clamscan` is a popular antivirus scanning tool for Unix-like operating systems using the ClamAV engine. The option `--disable-cache` disables the use of the ClamAV virus definition cache during a scan. This means that the scanner will check every file against the virus definitions online, rather than using the locally cached definitions. This can result in longer scan times and increased network usage, but ensures that the most up-to-date virus definitions are used for the scan.'
        dumpcerts: '[AI] `clamscan --dumpcerts` is a command-line option used with ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine. This option is specifically designed to extract and display the certificates contained in a scanned email or file. The extracted certificates are useful for analyzing the authenticity and validity of SSL/TLS digital certificates associated with phishing attempts, malware, or other security threats detected during the antivirus scan. By providing the `--dumpcerts` flag, ClamAV outputs the certificate data in a human-readable format, facilitating further examination and investigation.'
        exclude: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line tool for the Clam Antivirus software used to scan files and directories for viruses and other malware. The option `--exclude` is used to exclude specific files or directories from being scanned during a scan operation. When using this option, you can specify one or more patterns separated by commas or spaces. These patterns can be file paths, file name patterns (using wildcards), or regular expressions enclosed in single quotes. For example: `clamscan --exclude=''*.log,/path/to/directory/'' will exclude all files with the .log extension and the specified directory from being scanned during a scan.'
        exclude-dir: '[AI] The `clamscan` command is a tool used for scanning files and directories for viruses using the ClamAV antivirus engine. The option `--exclude-dir` allows you to exclude one or more directories from being scanned during a scan operation. This can be useful in situations where you want to avoid scanning large or non-essential directories, which may save time and system resources without compromising the overall security of the scan. The excluded directories will not be scanned for viruses and their contents will be skipped during the scan process.'
        exclude-pua: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner tool for the ClamAV antivirus engine. The option `--exclude-pua` is used to exclude Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs) from the scan results. PUAs are not necessarily malicious but can perform unwanted or intrusive behaviors, such as displaying unwanted advertisements or changing homepage settings without user consent. By using `--exclude-pua`, only potential viruses and other malware will be reported in the scan output.'
        file-list: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV. The `--file-list` option is used to scan files listed in a file instead of scanning files interactively. The specified file contains one file path per line, which are scanned in sequence. This mode can be useful for scanning large numbers of files in an automated way. The output shows the file name, its virus signature(s), and the result of the scan (clean or infected).'
        follow-dir-symlinks: '[AI] `clamscan` is a popular antivirus tool from the ClamAV project. The option `--follow-dir-symlinks` tells `clamscan` to follow symbolic links in directories being scanned. By default, `clamscan` does not follow symbolic links and only scans the symbolic link itself, not the target it points to. This option ensures that all files and directories reached through symbolic links are scanned, providing a more comprehensive scan of the system.'
        follow-file-symlinks: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV. The option `--follow-file-symlinks` tells `clamscan` to scan files and follow any existing symbolic links encountered during the scanning process. This means that the files pointed to by the symbolic links will also be scanned, allowing for a more comprehensive scan of a system or directory.'
        gen-json: '[AI] `clamscan --gen-json` is a command used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software. The `--gen-json` option tells ClamAV to output its scan results as JSON format instead of the default text format. This option allows for easier parsing and processing of scan data by applications or scripts that can handle JSON format.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV. The `--help` option displays detailed usage information, including supported arguments and options for scanning files or directories. Here are some common options:

            * `-r --recursive`: Recursively scan subdirectories.
            * `-l --list`: Display file names only.
            * `--exclude PATHS`: Exclude specified paths or files from scanning.
            * `--database DB_PATH`: Specify a custom database path.
            * `--quiet`: Suppress informational messages during the scan.
            * `--log LOGFILE`: Write log output to a file instead of standard error.
            * `-V --version`: Display version information and exit.
            * `--help`: Display help information and exit.
        heuristic-alerts: '[AI] `clamscan` is a free antivirus software tool from the ClamAV project. The option `--heuristic-alerts` enables heuristic analysis during a scan. Heuristics are rules or algorithms used to identify potential threats based on their behavior, without having a specific signature for the threat. When this option is used, clamscan will alert you if it detects suspicious files that don''t match any known virus definitions but may still be malicious based on heuristic analysis.'
        heuristic-scan-precedence: |-
            [AI] The `clamscan` command is a tool used in Clam Antivirus for scanning files and directories for viruses and other malware. The option `--heuristic-scan-precedence` affects the priority given to heuristic analysis in the scanning process.

            Heuristic analysis is a method of detecting malware by analyzing the behavior of a file, rather than relying on known signatures. This can help detect new or unknown threats.

            The `--heuristic-scan-precedence` option allows you to specify the precedence level for heuristic analysis. A higher precedence value will give more weight to heuristic analysis when making detection decisions. For example, setting this option to a high value such as 3 can increase the likelihood of detecting new or unknown threats at the cost of potentially generating more false positives. The default value is usually 1, which gives lower priority to heuristic analysis.
        include: '[AI] The `clamscan --include` option is used with ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software. This command-line directive specifies a list of file extensions or patterns to be scanned by ClamAV''s file scanner (clamscan). It ensures that only the specified files are scanned during a system scan or while analyzing specific files. The `--include` option helps improve the scanning performance and efficiency by excluding unnecessary files from being checked.'
        include-dir: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV. The option `--include-dir` specifies one or more directories to include in a scan. Files under and inside those directories will be scanned recursively. This can be useful when you want to scan specific directories while excluding others, saving time and resources compared to scanning the entire file system.'
        include-pua: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV. The option `--include-pua` tells `clamscan` to include Unidentified and Unresolved items in the scan results. PUA stands for Potentially Unwanted Application or Potentially Unwanted Object, which are files that may not be malicious but can perform unwanted actions or behaviors without explicit user consent. By including these items in the scan results, the user is made aware of their presence and can decide whether to take further action.'
        infected: '[AI] `clamscan --infected` is a command-line utility from Clam Antivirus, an open-source antivirus engine used to scan files and directories for malware. The `--infected` option specifically instructs the tool to only report files that it has identified as infected with a virus or other malware. It does not remove the threats but marks them for further action, such as deletion or quarantine. When run in this mode, Clamscan writes the name of each infected file to the standard error output (`stderr`) along with an error message.'
        leave-temps: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line tool from the Clam Antivirus software used to scan files and directories for viruses and malware. The option `--leave-temps` tells the tool not to delete temporary files generated during the scanning process. By default, ClamAV deletes these files after each scan to save disk space. Keeping the temporary files might help in debugging or reviewing the scan results.'
        log: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV. The option `--log` tells `clamscan` to produce a log file while scanning files or directories. This log contains detailed information about the scanning process and the results of each scan, including the name of the scanned item, its location, and the detection status of any malware found. The log file can be useful for troubleshooting and analyzing scan results in more detail.'
        max-dir-recursion: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV. The option `--max-dir-recursion <depth>` sets the maximum directory recursion depth for scanning. This means that `clamscan` will not scan more than the specified number of directories deep when detecting viruses and other malware in a directory tree. For example, if you set `--max-dir-recusion 3`, `clamscan` will only scan up to three levels deep from the starting directory. Deeper directories or files will be skipped during the scan. This option can help save time when scanning large directories or systems with limited resources.'
        max-embeddedpe: '[AI] "clamscan" is a command-line antivirus scanner tool from ClamAV. The option "--max-embeddedpe" sets a limit on the maximum size of PE (Portable Executable) files that are embedded in other files which clamscan will scan. This can be useful for improving scanning performance, as large files with many embedded PE files can take a long time to scan. By setting this option, clamscan will skip scanning any embedded PE files above the specified size, allowing it to focus resources on scanning more important parts of the file.'
        max-files: '[AI] The command `clamscan` with the option `--max-files <number>` sets a limit on the number of files or directories that ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine, will scan in one directory recursion. This can be useful when scanning large directories or entire drives to prevent potential performance issues or memory consumption. The specified number represents the maximum allowed files or directories for a single scanning process.'
        max-filesize: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner tool for ClamAV. The option `--max-filesize N` sets a limit on the size of files to be scanned. Files larger than the specified size (N being a number followed by KB, MB or GB) will be skipped during the scan process, improving performance and reducing unnecessary resource usage.'
        max-htmlnormalize: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from the ClamAV project. The option `--max-htmlnormalize` sets a limit on the amount of HTML code that `clamscan` will normalize during a scan. HTML normalization is a process where `clamscan` converts special characters in HTML entities to their corresponding characters for easier comparison with known malware signatures. By setting a limit, `clamscan` can avoid unnecessary resource consumption when scanning large or complex HTML files.'
        max-htmlnotags: '[AI] "clamscan" is a command-line antivirus scanner tool from the ClamAV project. The option "--max-htmlnotags <limit>" sets a limit for the number of HTML tags that clamscan will parse in a single HTML file during a scan for malware. This can be useful to improve scan performance when dealing with large or complex HTML files, as parsing all tags can be resource-intensive. By setting a limit, fewer tags will be parsed, reducing the time required for the scan. The value "<limit>" is the maximum number of HTML tags to parse.'
        max-iconspe: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV. The option `--max-iconspe` sets a limit on the maximum number of icons that will be displayed in the textual output when scanning files for viruses or malware. The number following `--max-iconspe` specifies the limit. For instance, `--max-iconspe 5` would only display the first five icons in the output. This option is useful when dealing with large numbers of files and wanting to limit the amount of output for better readability.'
        max-partitions: '[AI] The `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV. The option `--max-partitions=N` sets the maximum number of partitions to scan in a single directory. By default, clamscan scans all files in a directory recursively. With this option, you can limit the number of partitions (i.e., hard drives or file systems) it scans in parallel to improve performance or reduce resource usage, especially when scanning large directories spread across multiple partitions. Setting `N` to 1 means only the current partition will be scanned, while larger values allow for more partitions to be scanned concurrently.'
        max-rechwp3: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV, used to scan files and directories for viruses and other malware. The option `--max-depth 3` sets the maximum recursion depth for directory scanning to three levels deep. This means that ClamAV will only scan the specified files and directories, along with any contained within them up to a maximum of three levels deep. Beyond that, it will stop scanning.'
        max-recursion: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner tool from ClamAV. The `--max-recursion` option sets the maximum depth level of directories to be scanned for viruses and other malware. By default, clamscan scans files in the current directory only. Setting `--max-recursion n`, where n is a positive integer, will scan files up to that depth level below the current directory. This can help to cover a larger scope of files within a system or network for security checks.'
        max-scansize: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus scanner for ClamAV. The option `--max-scansize N` sets the maximum size of a file or archive that `clamscan` will scan. If the size of the file or archive exceeds this limit, `clamscan` will stop scanning and report an error. This option can be useful to avoid scanning large files or archives that are not suspected of containing viruses or other malware, saving time and system resources.'
        max-scantime: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV. The option `--max-scantime` sets a time limit for scanning a file or directory.

This can be useful when scanning large directories or systems with limited resources, preventing unnecessary long scans.'
        max-scriptnormalize: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV. The option `--max-scriptsnormalize` sets a limit on the maximum number of scripts that ClamAV will attempt to normalize during a scan. Scripts are parts of malware or potentially unwanted programs that can be obfuscated, making them hard to detect. Normalization is the process of converting scripts back into their original form for scanning and analysis. The `--max-scriptsnormalize` option allows setting an upper limit on the number of scripts to normalize per scan. This can help reduce the computational load during a scan and also make it faster. However, setting this limit too low could result in missed detections if there are many malicious scripts that need normalization for detection.'
        max-ziptypercg: '[AI] The command `clamscan --max-depth <n>` is used in ClamAV, an open-source antivirus software suite. This command runs a deep virus scan with a specified maximum depth or maximum number of directories to traverse recursively. The option `--max-depth <n>` sets the limit to `<n>` levels below the starting directory. For instance, if you run `clamscan --max-depth 3 /path/to/directory`, it will scan files and subdirectories up to three levels deep in the specified directory. The option `--max-ziptypercg` is not a valid ClamAV option.'
        move: '[AI] `clamscan --move` is a command-line option used with ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine. This option instructs ClamAV to move files that are detected as viruses or malware to a quarantine directory after scanning, instead of just reporting the detection and leaving the infected file in place. The `--move` flag helps maintain system security by automatically isolating potentially harmful files from the rest of the system.'
        no-summary: '[AI] `clamscan` is a command-line antivirus tool from ClamAV.
