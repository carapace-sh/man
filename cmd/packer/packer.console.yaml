    command: '[AI] `packer console` is a command provided by Packer, an open-source infrastructure automation tool. It starts an interactive Packer session in the terminal, allowing users to run Packer commands and interact with resources managed by Packer directly from the command line. This can be useful for debugging or executing ad-hoc tasks during the build or destroy process of your infrastructure.'
    flag:
        var: '[AI] `packer console -var` is a command used in Hashicorp Packer, an open-source tool for automating infrastructure deployment and management. The `console` sub-command starts an interactive session with the Packer configuration, allowing users to inspect and modify its state. The `-var` option sets or modifies variables passed to the Packer build process, enabling dynamic adjustments to the infrastructure configuration. In summary, `packer console -var` provides a way to interactively manage and customize Packer builds by setting variables on the fly.'

The `-var-file` option is used to specify a file containing variable values to be passed to Packer at runtime. This is useful when managing sensitive information or for handling dynamic values, allowing for greater flexibility and security in the automation process.'
