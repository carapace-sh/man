documentation:
    command: '[AI] "FTPD" stands for File Transfer Protocol Daemon. It is a server application that provides file transferring services using FTP (File Transfer Protocol). Clients use FTP to access and manipulate files on the FTPD server, including uploading, downloading, renaming, deleting, and listing files. FTPD supports various modes of operation and can be configured with different settings for security and functionality.'
    flag:
        anonymous-only: '[AI] The `ftp --anonymous-only` flag is used in FTP (File Transfer Protocol) servers to restrict access so that only anonymous users are allowed. Anonymous users are those who connect without providing a username and password. This setting limits the security risks associated with granting login access to anyone, as all files transferred will be in plain text and users cannot modify sensitive data or create new directories. However, it also means that anonymous users typically have limited permissions and cannot perform certain tasks like writing or deleting files.'
        auth: '[AI] The `ftpd --auth` command refers to the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) daemon with the additional option for "authentication." When the FTP server starts, this option enables it to require users to provide valid login credentials before granting access to the remote file system. It enhances security by ensuring that only authorized users can transfer files through the FTP server.'
        daemon: '[AI] `ftpd --daemon` is a command used in Unix-based systems to start the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, ftpd, in daemon mode. In this mode, the server runs in the background as a separate process, allowing other processes and the system to continue running without being blocked. This is particularly useful for long-term FTP server operation or during system startup. The `--daemon` flag instructs the server to detach from the terminal and run in the background after initialization.'
        debug: '[AI] `ftpd --debug` is a command used in FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server environments. The `--debug` option enables verbose or debug mode for the FTP daemon (ftpd), providing detailed output of its activities, including commands received from clients and responses sent back. This can be useful for troubleshooting connection issues, identifying client actions, or understanding how data transfers are being handled.'
        help: '[AI] `ftp --help` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to display help information for the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client utility. When executed with this option, it provides a summary of various command line arguments and options supported by the FTP client, along with brief descriptions of what each argument or option does. It is useful for quickly understanding how to use the FTP client for transferring files between local and remote systems.'
        ipv4: '[AI] `ftpd` is a common name for an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server daemon. The option `--ipv4` is passed to this daemon during its execution to specify that it should only bind and listen on the IPv4 protocol stack for incoming connections. IPv4 and IPv6 are two versions of the Internet Protocol, each with its own unique address format and functionality. By using `--ipv4`, the server will not support IPv6 addresses or connections.'
        ipv6: '[AI] `ftpd --ipv6` is a command-line option for the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) daemon, specifically specifying the IPv6 protocol. The FTPD server will then listen and serve connections using IPv6 addresses instead of IPv4. This configuration allows FTP to communicate over the IPv6 network infrastructure.'
        logging: |-
            [AI] The `ftpd --logging` command is used to start the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) daemon with logging enabled. FTP is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.

            The `--logging` option enables the FTP server to log various types of events, such as file transfers, authentication attempts, and commands issued by clients. The logs are typically stored in text files, which can be analyzed later for troubleshooting, security auditing, or other purposes. The location and format of the logs can be configured through the FTP server's configuration file or environment variables.
        max-timeout: '[AI] The `--max-timeout` option in the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server command `ftpd` sets a limit on how long an FTP command or data transfer can take place before being terminated. This helps prevent unresponsive or hung clients from consuming excessive server resources. If a command or data transfer exceeds this set timeout, the FTP session is closed automatically.'
        no-version: '[AI] The command `ftp --no-version` is used in File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to initiate a connection without sending or receiving the FTP version information during the initial exchange between the client and server. This option can be useful for automating FTP processes where version checks are not necessary, or when connecting to an FTP server with known version compatibility. By omitting the version check, the FTP session may run more efficiently as less data is transmitted during the connection setup.'
        non-rfc2577: '[AI] The `ftpd --non-rfc2577` is a command used in Unix-based systems to start an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server that does not adhere to RFC 2577, which is the standard specification for FTP implementation. In other words, it''s a non-compliant FTP server. This flag is typically used when running older or customized versions of the FTP daemon (vsftpd or proftpd, for example) that may have specific features or configurations that do not align with RFC 2577 requirements. However, using a non-RFC compliant FTP server could introduce security vulnerabilities and interoperability issues with some clients.'
        pidfile: '[AI] The `--pidfile` option in the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) daemon `ftpd` command refers to a configuration setting where the daemon writes its process identifier (PID) to a specified file upon starting up. This feature is useful for managing and monitoring the FTP server as it allows administrators or system tools to easily identify the running instance of the FTP server process, track its status, and perform actions such as reloading the configuration or gracefully stopping the server using signals. The location of the PID file can be specified with an argument when invoking the `ftpd` command.'
        timeout: '[AI] The `--timeout` option in the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) command `ftpd` sets a limit on the time a client can remain idle before the server terminates the connection. This helps prevent unintended or unauthorized use of network resources, and improves overall server performance by freeing up idle connections. The duration is usually specified in seconds. For example, `--timeout 120` sets the idle timeout to 120 seconds.'
        umask: '[AI] The `--umask` option in the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server command `ftpd` sets the umask (User Mask) value for newly created files and directories on the server during file transfers. Umask is a value in octal format (0-777) that specifies which permissions are denied to new files or directories by default, preserving the original file permissions as much as possible. For instance, `--umask 022` denies write permission to group and others while maintaining read and execute permissions for the owner and group.'
        usage: |-
            [AI] `ftp` is a common file transfer protocol used to move files between a client and server over a TCP connection. The command `ftp --usage` displays the usage information for the `ftp` command-line tool. This information includes valid options, arguments, and their descriptions. Here's an example of what you might see:

            ```bash
            Usage: ftp [-i] [-n] [-g] [-v] [-s scriptfile] [[user]:[password]@]host[:port]
                    ftp [verbose|quiet][[-ncF] [-R number-of-retries] [[-E]] [[-A] [-E type]]
                      [-P passive] [-S second_level_protcol] [-C command_file]
                      [-D data_channel_type] [-L local_type] [-R remote_type]
                      [--] [file ...]

            Options:
              -i      Interactive mode (prompt for each file).
              -n      No passive (use active FTP instead).
              -g      Get mode, get files in binary format.
              -v      Verbose mode (display each command and response).
              ...
            ```

            This usage information shows the basic `ftp` command syntax, followed by a list of available options like `-i`, `-n`, `-g`, etc., with brief descriptions for their functionality.
        version: '[AI] `ftp --version` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to display version information about the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client software that is installed. When executed, it will print out the name of the FTP client, its version number, and sometimes other relevant information such as compilation dates or built-from sources. This can be helpful for determining if a specific security update or bug fix is needed for the FTP client software.'
