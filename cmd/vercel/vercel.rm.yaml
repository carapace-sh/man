    command: '[AI] `vercel rm` is a command used in Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. This command is used to remove files or directories from your project that are being synced to Vercel. When you run `vercel rm <file_or_directory>`, it deletes the specified item locally and removes it from the next deployment. This can be useful for removing unused or temporary files before deploying.'
