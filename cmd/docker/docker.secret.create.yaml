documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker secret create` is a Docker CLI command used to create a new secret object in Docker''s built-in key-value store, Docker Secrets. The command takes one required argument which is the name for the new secret. When you run this command, it generates and encrypts a random value using the default encryption algorithm (gpg) and stores both the name and encrypted value inside the Docker Swarm or Docker Registry. This command is used to securely store sensitive data, such as API keys or database passwords, that should not be committed to source control or hardcoded in your application code.'
    flag:
        driver: '[AI] The `docker secret create` command is used in Docker to create a new secret, which is an encrypted storage object for sensitive data such as passwords or API keys. The `--driver` option specifies the backend driver to use for storing and managing the secrets. For example, `--driver=aws` would create the secret using AWS KMS (Key Management Service) as the backend. Other available drivers include `gcp`, `azure`, `filesystem`, etc., depending on your specific use case and infrastructure setup.'
        label: '[AI] The `docker secret create` command is used to create a new Docker secret, which is an encrypted storage object for sensitive data such as passwords or API keys. The `--label` option allows you to assign metadata labels to the secret for easier identification and organization. For example, you could use labels like `app=my-app`, `environment=production`, or `team=devops`. These labels can be queried later using the Docker CLI or Docker API.'
        template-driver: '[AI] `docker secret create` is a command used in Docker to create a new secret, which is encrypted data that can be stored and managed by Docker. The `--template-driver` option is an argument specific to this command, specifying the template driver to use when creating the secret from a template. This allows for the creation of secrets based on predefined templates, simplifying the process of creating and managing sensitive information in a secure and standardized way.'
