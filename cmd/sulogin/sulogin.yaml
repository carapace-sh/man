documentation:
    command: '[AI] `sulogin` is not a standard Linux command. It seems to be specific to the AppArmor security profile system used in some Linux distributions for mandatory access control. The command is used to log in as a specific AppArmor profile, granting that profile the root (administrative) privileges, while keeping the identity of the actual user logging in hidden. This allows auditing and monitoring of actions performed under that profile.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] `sulogin` is a tool used in Substance Universal License Server (ULS) to manage user licenses. The `--force` flag is an option that can be passed with certain `sulogin` commands to override existing restrictions or warnings and perform actions that might otherwise fail. For instance, when using the `--activate` command to assign a license to a new user, the `--force` flag can be used to activate an already-assigned license, or to ignore expired or revoked licenses. The use of `--force` should be employed with caution as it can potentially disrupt the licensing system if misused.'
        help: '[AI] `sulogin` is a tool used for logging into and managing sessions in SuSE Linux''s Single Sign-On (SSO) service. The `--help` option displays detailed information about how to use `sulogin`. It shows the available command line arguments, their descriptions, and usage examples. In summary, using `sulogin --help` provides assistance on how to effectively employ the `sulogin` utility for SSO interactions.'
        login-shell: |-
            [AI] The `sulogin --login-shell` command is used in the Subtlety Ultra Lightweight Operating System (SuloOS) for Linux. This command is responsible for handling user login sessions and setting the login shell for the user.

            The `--login-shell` option specifies that the given shell should be used as the user's login shell, which is the shell that runs when a user logs in to their account. The shell interprets the user's home directory, environment variables, and other settings specific to their account. It sets up the environment for the user's interactive sessions.

            After a successful login, SuloOS uses the provided shell (e.g., bash, zsh, sh) as the user's default shell for their session.
        timeout: '[AI] The `--timeout` option in the `sulogin` command is used to set a time limit for SSH connections. When this option is specified, the connection will be terminated if it remains idle for longer than the specified time. This can help prevent unintended or unauthorized use of resources on a system. The syntax for using this option is `sulogin [user@host]:[port] --timeout=[duration]`. For example, `sulogin user@example.com:22 --timeout=30m` would set a timeout of 30 minutes for an SSH connection to the specified host and port.'
        version: |-
            [AI] `sulogin` is a command-line tool for logging into and managing clusters in SuSE Linux Enterprise Platform's Microservices Gateway, called SUSE Rancher. The `--version` option is used to display the version information of the installed `sulogin` client. When you run `sulogin --version`, it returns the name of the tool, followed by its major.minor release number and build information. For example:

            ```bash
            sulogin version: 3.0.5+git20211217-g4f69b8d-build0014
            ```

            This output indicates that the `sulogin` client is version 3.0.5, with a Git commit hash of `g4f69b8d`.
