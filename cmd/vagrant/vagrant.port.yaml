documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `vagrant port` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for managing virtual machines and development environments, to show or configure the ports that are forwarded from the guest machine to the host machine. When run without any arguments, it will list all the configured port mappings. With an argument like `22:8080`, it configures Vagrant to forward port 22 on the guest machine to port 8080 on the host machine.'
    flag:
        guest: |-
            [AI] The `vagrant port --guest` command is used in Vagrant, a tool for managing virtual machines, to map a guest machine's port to a host machine's port. This allows communication between the guest and host machines on specific ports.

            When you run `vagrant port <guest_port> --guest`, you are instructing Vagrant to forward the specified guest port (`<guest_port>`) to a specific host port (the default is 4000). The `--guest` option is used to indicate that the port mapping should be applied to the guest machine, not the provisioner. This command helps in accessing services running on the guest machine from the host machine through the assigned host port.
