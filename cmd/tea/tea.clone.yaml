documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea clone` command is not a standard Unix or Linux command. It seems to be specific to version control systems, such as Tectonic''s Git-like Teaspoon. The `tea clone` command is used to create a local copy of an existing repository from a remote server. It downloads the entire project history and makes it accessible locally for working, committing changes, and pushing them back to the remote server when ready.'
    flag:
        depth: '[AI] The `git tea clone --depth` command is used to create a shallow clone of a Git repository, meaning only the latest commit and a limited history will be downloaded instead of the entire history. This can save time and disk space, but it also means that some history and branches might not be accessible in the clone. The depth option determines how far back in history to fetch, with `--depth <num>` specifying a specific number of commits to fetch from the past of the current branch, or `--depth=full` for a full clone.'
        login: |-
            [AI] The `tea clone --login` command is used in TEA (The Edge Anomaly) CLI, a tool for managing and interacting with Kubernetes clusters. This specific command is used to create a new working directory for a Kubernetes project and automatically log into the target cluster using an existing Kubernetes context.

            Here's a breakdown of what each part of the command does:

            - `tea`: Invokes the TEA CLI tool.
            - `clone`: Informs the CLI that we want to clone or create a new project directory.
            - `--login`: Enables automatic login to the specified target Kubernetes cluster when creating the new project directory.
