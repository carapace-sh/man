documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command with the `to-sri` option generates a Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) checksum for a given file or data input in the SRI (Secure Rolling Hash) format, which includes the hash algorithm name, version, and the actual hash value. The resulting output is a string that starts with `--sri-hash=` followed by the SHA-1 hash value.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] The command `nix-hash to-sri --debug` is a Nix expression used to generate an SRI (Subresource Integrity) hash for a file using Nix''s built-in hashing functions. The `to-sri` subcommand extracts the content of a file and calculates its SHA-3 or SHA-256 hash, which is then appended with the prefix `sha3-` or `sha256-` followed by the length of the hash in hexadecimal digits. The `--debug` flag adds more detailed output to the terminal for debugging purposes.'
        log-format: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command with the option `--to-sri` generates a NIX Expression representing a hash value of given data. The `--log-format` option specifies the format of the log output. For example, using `--log-format="json"` would generate JSON formatted logs. Together, these options create an expression that can be used to fetch and verify the hash of a file or other data within the NIX Package Manager system.'
        print-build-logs: |-
            [AI] `nix-hash` is a command-line tool from Nix package manager used to compute and verify hashes of Nix expressions or builds. The specific command `nix-hash to-sri --print-build-logs` performs the following tasks:

            1. `nix-hash`: This is the main command that is being invoked. It's used to compute and print hashes of a given expression, in this case, "to-sri".

            2. `to-sri`: This is an argument specifying the Nix expression or build to be hashed. In other words, it refers to the output from a previous Nix build command.

            3. `--print-build-logs`: This option tells `nix-hash` to also print the build logs of the corresponding Nix build command (which produced the output referenced by "to-sri"). The build logs provide information about the construction process, including any dependencies and their respective versions, compilation steps, and error messages if any.

            In summary, `nix-hash to-sri --print-build-logs` computes and prints the hash of a Nix expression or build ("to-sri") along with its corresponding build logs. This can be useful for verifying the integrity of the built artifact while also understanding the build process.
        quiet: '[AI] `nix-hash` is a command-line tool from the Nix packaging system used to compute and verify cryptographic hashes of files or outputs of other commands. The option `--to-sri` specifies that the output should be in SRI format, which is a format for expressing hash data suitable for use in configuration management systems. The option `quiet` suppresses all non-error messages during execution. Therefore, running `nix-hash to-sri --quiet <file/command>` will produce only the SRI hash data without any additional output.'
        type: '[AI] The command `nix-hash` is a tool from the Nix Package Manager used to compute and print file hashes. The option `--to-sri` specifies that the output should be in SRI (Secure Hash Registry) format, which includes the algorithm name along with the hash value. The `--type` option further specifies the hash type: it can be set to "sha2" for SHA-256, "sha3" for SHA-3, or any other supported hash algorithm. Thus, `nix-hash --to-sri --type sha2 filename.ext` will print the SHA-256 hash of `filename.ext` in SRI format.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] The command `nix-hash` is a tool from Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. The specific command `nix-hash to-sri --verbose` performs the following tasks:

            1. `nix-hash`: Invokes the Nix hash command which computes cryptographic hashes of files or directories.
            2. `to-sri`: Specifies that it should output the results in SRI (Secure Rolling Hash) format, a method used by Nix to verify the integrity of downloaded data during system builds.
            3. `--verbose`: Enables detailed output, providing more information about the files being hashed and the resulting hash values.
