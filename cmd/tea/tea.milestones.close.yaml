documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea milestones close` command is used in TeamFoundationServer (TFS) or Azure DevOps to close a specific milestone in a project''s Agile process. This action signifies that no more work items can be added or changed for the closed milestone, and the team will focus on the next open milestone. It helps in tracking progress towards project goals and deadlines.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The `--force` option in the `tea milestones close` command of the Git Tea CLI tool is used to forcibly close a milestone even if there are commits that have not been pushed to the remote repository yet. This can be useful when you want to close a milestone for planning or record-keeping purposes, but are not quite done with all the development work associated with it. However, be cautious as using `--force` may result in data loss if there are conflicting changes between local and remote branches. It is recommended that you use this option only after ensuring that all local commits have been pushed upstream before closing a milestone.'
        login: '[AI] The `--login` option in the `tea milestones close` command is used with the TestEngine Agile (TEA) tool for Jenkins. This command closes a specific milestone in TEA and logs in the specified user for performing the operation. The user provided should have sufficient permissions to close milestones within the given project or repository.'
        output: '[AI] `tea milestones close --output` is a command used in the Jenkins Continuous Integration (CI) tool with the TinkerPlant Jenkins Extension for TestingAsCode (TEA) plugin. This command closes specified milestones in the TEA test history and generates an output file containing details of the closed milestones, such as their IDs and the reason for closure. It helps in managing and maintaining a clear and up-to-date test history for better visibility into test results over time.'
        remote: '[AI] The `tea milestones close --remote` command is used in the Jenkins Continuous Integration (CI) tool with the Tapestry Extension for Jenkins (TEA). This command is utilized to close milestones of a specific Tapestry project remotely via the Jenkins API. It helps in managing project development stages by marking a milestone as closed after testing and integration activities are completed successfully, enabling better project visibility and tracking progress.'
        repo: '[AI] The `--teaproject` or `--repo` flag in the `tea milestones close` command is used with Git''s Teaspoon (Tea) tool, which is a Git extension for managing and querying Git tags as if they were a semantic versioning system. This flag specifies the name of the repository where the operation will be performed. When closing a milestone with this command, it updates the default branch with a new tag corresponding to the closed milestone, only in the specified Git repository.'
