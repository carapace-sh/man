documentation:
    command: '[AI] `helm list` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes. It returns information about installed releases and their corresponding charts. The output displays each release name, status (e.g., deployed, upgraded), and the chart repository where it was installed from. This command provides an overview of the current state of your Helm-managed applications within your Kubernetes cluster.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `helm list --all` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command lists all installed releases managed by Helm in a cluster, including those that are hidden or partially deployed. The `--all` flag makes Helm display releases in the desired state, regardless of their current status.'
        all-namespaces: '[AI] `helm list --all-namespaces` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command displays a list of all released Helm charts across all namespaces in the cluster. The output includes the chart name, namespace, release name, status, and creation time. It provides an overview of all installed applications managed by Helm in the entire cluster.'
        date: '[AI] `helm list --date` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command lists all released Helm charts and their corresponding releases, revisions, and creation time (the date). The output shows the chart name, namespace, release name, status, and creation timestamp. It allows users to easily check the installation details and manage their Kubernetes applications using Helm.'
        deployed: '[AI] `helm list --deployed` is a command used with Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command lists all the deployed releases managed by Helm in the current Kubernetes cluster. The output shows the release name, chart used, status (running or not), and other relevant information. It provides an overview of the currently active applications installed using Helm in the cluster.'
        failed: '[AI] `helm list --failed` is a Helm command used to list all released Helm charts in your Kubernetes cluster, but only showing those with failed status. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, and a chart is a collection of files that define an application or microservice for deployment on the platform. When a release fails, it means that there were errors during the installation or upgrade process. By using `--failed` flag, you can quickly identify and focus on those releases that require attention to rectify any issues and get them back to a healthy state.'
        filter: '[AI] `helm list --filter` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command lists all released Helm charts running in your Kubernetes cluster with the added functionality of filtering the output based on specific labels or values. The `--filter` flag follows the `list` command and takes a query string to apply filters on the chart name, release name, or values of their labels or annotations. For example, `helm list --filter app=myapp` lists all releases with the label ''app'' equal to ''myapp''. This command helps in quickly identifying and managing specific deployments within your Kubernetes environment.'
        max: '[AI] `helm list --max` is a command used with Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. The `--max` option returns only the maximum number of releases specified. By default, `helm list` displays all released charts in your local Helm repository. With `--max`, you can limit the output to a specific number, making it useful for quickly checking the state of a large number of releases.'
        offset: '[AI] `helm list --offset` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes. This command lists all released charts managed by Helm, along with their respective releases and versions. The `--offset` flag is an optional argument that specifies the number of records to skip at the beginning of the output. It''s useful when dealing with large numbers of releases, allowing you to view a specific subset of the information.'
        output: '[AI] `helm list --output` is a command used with Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes. This specific command lists all released charts in your local Helm repository or cluster, displaying their names, releases versions, and statuses (running, upgraded, or failed). The `--output` flag modifies the output format, allowing you to customize the output to various formats such as JSON or YAML. By default, it displays the results in a tabular format, making it easy for users to understand their Helm releases at a glance.'
        pending: '[AI] The `helm list --pending` command is used with Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command displays a list of releases that are currently pending installation or upgrade in the Helm repository. These pending releases have been initiated via `helm install` or `helm upgrade` commands but have not yet completed the installation process. The output will show the release name, chart used, status, and other relevant information.'
        reverse: '[AI] `helm list --reverse` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes. This command lists all released Helm charts and their corresponding releases in a cluster. The `--reverse` option sorts the output in reverse-chronological order, meaning that the most recently created or updated releases appear first.'
        selector: '[AI] `helm list --selector` is a command used with Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command lists all released charts (applications) managed by Helm in the local Kubernetes cluster. The `--selector` option filters the output based on custom labels attached to the releases. For example, `--selector app=myapp` will display only releases with the label `app: myapp`. This allows for easy management and organization of multiple releases within a cluster.'
        short: '[AI] `helm list --short` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command displays a minimal output of the currently installed Helm releases and their corresponding charts with release name, status, and revision. It''s commonly used to get an overview of installed applications managed by Helm in a compact format.'
        superseded: '[AI] `helm list --superseded` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command lists all the released versions of Helm charts that have been superseded, meaning they are no longer recommended for use because there is a newer and likely improved version available. The output will show the name, namespace, status, and last deployed version for each chart with a superseded status.'
        time-format: '[AI] `helm list --time-format` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to list all released charts and their corresponding releases, including their creation time. The `--time-format` flag is an optional argument that customizes the output format of the release creation times according to the given strftime format specifier. For example, `--time-format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"` would display the dates and times in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".'
        uninstalled: '[AI] `helm list --uninstalled` is a command used in Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes, to list all the Helm charts that are installed locally but not currently deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. The `--uninstalled` flag filters the output to only show these charts, which may be useful for re-deploying or managing them separately.'
        uninstalling: '[AI] `helm list --uninstalling` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager. This command lists all released Helm charts installed in your Kubernetes cluster, but focuses on those that are currently being uninstalled or have been marked for deletion. The output displays the chart name, namespace, release name, status, and revision. It is typically used to get an overview of the Helm releases being removed from a cluster, allowing for confirmation before the actual uninstallation process is completed.'
