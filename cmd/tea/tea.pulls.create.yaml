documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea pulls create` command is used in the Tectonic (now Dockered Kubernetes) platform to create a new Kubernetes resource pull secret. A pull secret is an encrypted key used to authenticate with a container registry when pulling images for a deployment. This command generates and saves the pull secret as a Kubernetes Secret object, allowing you to use it in your YAML manifests or apply it directly using `kubectl`.'
    flag:
        allow-maintainer-edits: '[AI] The `--allow-maintainer-edits` flag is used in Debian packaging with the `git-buildpackage` or `quilt` tools to allow the package maintainer to make changes directly to the source code repository, bypassing the version control history. This can be useful when quick fixes are needed without creating a new Git commit, but it should be used with caution as it may introduce potential conflicts or issues with the collaboration and review processes in larger projects.'
        assignees: '[AI] The `--assignees` flag in the GitHub command `git pull origin <branch> --rebase --teapot` is used to assign specific users or teams as assignees for new commits created during a rebase or merge process when pulling changes from a remote repository into your local branch. It allows collaborative work and clear responsibility assignment within a team or project.'
        base: '[AI] `--base` is an option used with the Git command `git pull --rebase`. It specifies the name of a branch that should be used as the base for the rebase operation. In other words, it sets the upstream branch that your local branch will be rebased onto. This can be useful when you want to ensure that your local changes are applied on top of the latest changes from the remote repository.'
        deadline: '[AI] `--deadline` is an option used with the `teaproc` command in Kubernetes, specifically with the `teacreate` subcommand. It sets a deadline for the TeaReplicaController to finish creating a new replica before considering it failed. This can be useful in ensuring timely deployment of applications or preventing long-running creations from blocking other processes. The format is `--deadline=<duration>`, where `<duration>` can be specified in various time units such as seconds, minutes, hours, or days. For example, `--deadline=1m30s` sets a deadline of 1 minute and 30 seconds.'

            [AI] The `tea pulls create --description` command in Kubernetes is used to create a new Teaproxy (Tea) pull secret, which is a type of Kubernetes secret that securely stores sensitive information such as credentials for accessing registries or other external sources.

            When you run this command with the `--description` flag, you're providing a descriptive label for the new pull secret. This description will help you identify the purpose or function of the pull secret when you view it in the Kubernetes cluster later on.

            For example:
            ```css
            tea pulls create my-registry-pull-secret --description="Pull secret for accessing myprivate registry"
            ```
            This command creates a new Teaproxy pull secret named `my-registry-pull-secret`, and assigns the description "Pull secret for accessing myprivate registry".
        head: '[AI] `git teapull create --head` is a Git command used to create a new branch based on the current head of another branch, without performing a merge. This command is typically used when you want to start a new branch from the latest changes in another branch, but don''t want to automatically merge the changes yet. The `--head` option tells Git to use the current head as the starting point for the new branch instead of merging it directly into the new branch.'
        labels: '[AI] `teaproject create` is a command used in Kubernetes for creating new projects or namespaces with predefined resources, such as a Deployment, Service, and Ingress. The `--labels` option allows users to set labels for the created resources. Labels are key-value pairs that help in organizing and filtering objects in Kubernetes clusters. By setting labels during creation, users can easily select and manage related resources using label selectors.'
        login: '[AI] `teaproject pull create --login` is a command used in Teaproject, an open-source DevOps tool for containerized applications. This command creates a new repository or branch pull request with a pre-configured Docker login step. The `--login` flag indicates that the repository contains credentials necessary to pull images from a private registry. When this command is executed, Teaproject will create a GitHub or GitLab pull request with a YAML pipeline configuration file that includes a step for logging into the specified private registry before attempting to pull and build container images.'
        milestone: '[AI] The `--milestone` option in the `tea pulls create` command is used to specify a Git branch or tag as the target milestone for a new pull request in the TEA (Train Engineer Assistant) tool, which is a GitOps tool for managing Kubernetes clusters. When creating a new pull request with this command, the specified milestone will be associated with the request and can help track its progress through the development process.'
        referenced-version: '[AI] The `--referenced-version` option in the `teap pulls create` command for Helm is used to specify the exact version of a Helm chart to deploy, pulling only that particular version from the specified repository instead of the latest one. This can be useful when you want to ensure consistency across different environments by deploying a specific, known-working version of your application.'
        remote: '[AI] `tea pulls create --remote` is a command used in the Tectonic (now Docker for Kubernetes) platform to create a new Kubernetes manifest YAML file from an existing remote Git repository. It sets up the necessary configurations, such as replicas and containers, to deploy the application on a Kubernetes cluster. The `--remote` flag indicates that the repository is located remotely (not local).'
        repo: '[AI] The `teap pulls create --repo` command is used in the Teap (Teleport Access Plugin) tool for managing Kubernetes clusters and infrastructure access. This command creates a new repository within Teap, which can be used to store and manage access policies and certificates. Repositories in Teap provide a way to organize and share access controls across multiple clusters and environments, making it easier to manage and enforce security policies.'
        title: '[AI] `tea pulls create --title` is a command used in GitHub''s Tea (Temporal Access) to create a new pull request with a specified title. This command doesn''t actually create the changeset or branch for the pull request, it only sets up the PR with the given title and other necessary metadata. Once created, you can still edit the contents of the PR before merging it into the target branch.'
