    command: '[AI] The `ng generate app-shell` command is used with Angular CLI to create a new Angular application named `app-shell`, which will serve as the core or shell of a larger Angular project. This command sets up a new workspace, creates a new application with an empty AppComponent and other basic files, and sets it up as a library in the workspace that can be imported into other applications.'
    flag:
        app-dir: |-
            [AI] `ng generate app-shell --app-dir` is a command used in Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. The `generate` keyword initiates the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) to create new files and folders following a specified template.

            The `app-shell` part of the command specifies the desired template. In this case, it's the "App Shell" architecture pattern. This pattern involves having a pre-rendered "shell" or "skeleton" application that other "feature modules" are built upon. The shell contains common elements such as the app's header and footer.

            The `--app-dir` flag is used to specify where in your current Angular project the new files and folders should be created. By default, it would create them under a subdirectory named 'generate-view'. However, if you provide the `--app-dir` option followed by a directory name of your choice, the generated files will be placed directly into that specified directory.
        app-id: '[AI] The command `ng generate app-shell --app-id` is used in Angular framework for generating a new Angular Application Project, named as `app-shell`, with a specified application ID. The `--app-id` option sets the custom name for the new application within the Angular CLI workflow. This command creates essential files and configurations required to set up a new Angular project.'
        main: '[AI] The `ng generate app-shell --main` command is used to create a new Angular application called `app-shell` with a pre-configured structure focusing on building a shell or a base application for other Angular applications. The `--main` option indicates that this application will serve as the main application, meaning it will be responsible for rendering other Angular modules or features. This command uses Angular CLI to automate the creation and setup of the project.'
        project: '[AI] The `ng generate app-shell --project` command is used with Angular CLI to create a new Angular application called "app-shell" as part of an existing Angular project. The `--project` option specifies the name of the current project, ensuring that the new application will be created as a sub-application within the existing project structure. This command sets up a basic shell application including AppComponent, AppRoutingModule, and other necessary files.'
        root-module-class-name: |-
            [AI] `ng generate app-shell` is a command used in Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications, to create a new Angular application project with a preconfigured layout called "app shell" architecture. This architecture separates the application's shell (common layout and navigation) from its features.

            The `--root-module-class-name` option allows you to specify the custom name for the root module class of the generated app-shell project, which will be located in the `apps/app-shell` folder by default. This can be useful when working on multiple related projects that follow the same architecture but need distinct names for their root modules.
        root-module-file-name: '[AI] `ng generate app-shell` is a command used in Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. This command is used to create a new Angular application with a predefined structure, called an "application shell." The `--root-module-file-name` option allows you to specify the custom name of the root module file (`.ngmodule` extension) in the generated project. By default, this file is named `app.ngmodule`, but using this option, you can set a different name if desired. This command generates files and sets up configurations accordingly.'
        route: '[AI] `ng generate app-shell --route` is a command used in Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. The command uses the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) to create a new Angular application project named `app-shell` and adds a new route to it. The `--route` option specifies that a new route file along with its corresponding component and associated files will also be generated. This command simplifies the process of creating a new Angular application with a preconfigured route, saving time and effort for developers building larger applications.'
