documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dircolors` is a utility in Unix-like operating systems that customizes the colors used by various file listing commands like `ls`, `tree`, and `git status`. It reads color definitions from a file, usually located at `~/.dir_colors` or `/etc/DIR_COLORS`, and sets the colors for different types of files accordingly. By default, it provides basic color schemes but can be extended to create customized ones by adding new color definitions.'

        bourne-shell: |-
            [AI] The `dircolors --bourne-shell` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems that allows users to customize the colors used when listing directory contents with the `ls` command, specifically for the Bourne Shell (sh) terminal.

            The `--bourne-shell` option ensures that the color definitions are compatible with the Bourne Shell. The output of this command is a series of definitions for various file types and directories, each preceded by a keyword and colored according to user preference. These definitions are stored in the `.dir_colors` file in the user's home directory. Users can edit this file to customize their terminal colors when using the Bourne Shell.
        c-shell: '[AI] The `dircolors --c-shell` command is used to configure the colors for the `ls` (list) command in the C Shell (csh). The `dircolors` utility generates a script with color definitions that can be sourced into the user''s shell startup file. By using the `--c-shell` option, you ensure that the generated script is compatible with the C Shell. This allows for enhanced visualization of directory listings by displaying different colors for various file types (e.g., directories, executables, scripts, etc.).'
        csh,: '[AI] `dircolors --csh` is a command in Unix-like operating systems used to configure colorization of directory listing output for the C Shell (csh and tcsh). The `--csh` option specifies this particular shell. The `dircolors` utility reads from its standard input a set of definitions for colors, which are then applied when displaying the output of commands like `ls`. This allows directories to be distinguished by color based on their names or file types, improving readability.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `dircolors --help` is a command in GNU Coreutils used to configure the colors for the `ls` (list) command output. The help option displays detailed information about how to use this utility, including:

            1. Description of the command: sets or displays the colors used by the `ls` command.
            2. Syntax: explains the basic command usage with options and arguments.
            3. Options: lists the available options for customizing color schemes. Some common ones are `--init`, `--save`, and specific color scheme names like "Solarized Dark" or "Default".
            4. Examples: demonstrates how to use the command in various scenarios.
            5. Exit status: defines the return values based on successful execution or errors.
        print-database: '[AI] `dircolors --print-database` is a command in GNU Coreutils that displays the contents of the directory colorization database file. This database contains definitions for various colors and styles used to highlight different types of files when listing directories with commands like `ls`. The colors are defined using ANSI escape codes, which can be customized by editing the database file or creating a personalized one.'
        sh,: '[AI] `dircolors --sh` is a command in GNU Core Utilities, specifically used to configure the colors for the output of the `ls` (list) command when using the Bash or Zsh shells. The `--sh` option specifies that the color definitions should follow the System V / BSD format, which is the default for most Unix-like systems. When you run this command without any arguments in a terminal, it writes the color definitions to the file `~/.dir_colors` by default. You can use these colors in your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) or directly in the terminal to customize the appearance of your directory listings.'
        version: '[AI] The `dircolors --version` command is used to display the version information of the `dircolors` utility in Unix-like operating systems. `dircolors` is a program that customizes the appearance of directory listing output by setting colors for various types of files and directories. When you run `dircolors --version`, it will print out the version number, often in the format "dircolors (XYZ)". The XYZ represents the specific version of the utility installed on your system.'
