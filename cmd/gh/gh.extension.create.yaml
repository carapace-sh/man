    command: '[AI] `gh extension create` is a GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) command used to create a new GitHub Extension project locally on your machine. It sets up a new directory with the necessary file structure and initializes it as a Node.js project. This command is typically used by developers who want to build custom tools or integrations for GitHub, leveraging its extensive API capabilities.'
    flag:
        precompiled: '[AI] The `gh extend create --precompiled` command is a sub-command used in the GitHub CLI (Git Hub Hub) for creating new extensions with precompiled binaries. Precompiled binaries are binaries that have already been compiled outside of the extension''s development environment, making the extension installation process faster and more efficient, since it doesn''t require building the binary from source each time. The command creates a new directory structure for the extension, initializes a Git repository, and sets up basic files such as `manifest.json` and `package.json`.'
