documentation:
    command: '[AI] `cargo uninstall` is a command used in Rust programming language''s package manager, Cargo. It is used to remove packages and their dependencies from your project''s `Cargo.lock` file and the local cache. When you run this command followed by the name of the package or dependency, Cargo removes the entry related to it from the lock file, and then deletes the cached package. This can be helpful when you want to remove a package that is no longer needed, or if you encounter issues with a particular package or dependency.'
    flag:
        bin: '[AI] The `cargo uninstall --bin` command is used in Rust programming language''s package manager, Cargo. This command is used to remove a binary (compiled executable) that was previously installed using Cargo. By running `--bin`, we specify that we want to uninstall a specific binary and not the entire package or its dependencies.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `cargo uninstall` is a command-line tool provided by Rust's package manager, Cargo. The `--help` flag is used to display detailed help information about this command. Here's what it does in a nutshell:

            When you run `cargo uninstall --help`, Cargo will output an explanation of the `cargo uninstall` command, including its purpose (removing installed Cargo packages), usage syntax, examples, and available options. The options allow you to specify which package(s) to uninstall based on their names or versions.
        package: '[AI] The `cargo uninstall` command is a part of Rust''s package manager called Cargo. This command is used to remove a specific package and its dependencies from your local Cargo cache. The `--package` option specifies the name of the package to be uninstalled. Once executed, this command deletes the installed version of the specified package and its dependencies from your system, allowing you to manage your project''s dependencies effectively.'
        quiet: '[AI] `cargo uninstall --quiet` is a command used in Rust programming language''s package manager, Cargo. This command removes the specified crate (package) from the local Cargo cache without printing any messages to the terminal. The `--quiet` option suppresses all output except for error messages.'
        root: |-
            [AI] The `cargo uninstall` command is a part of Rust's package manager, Cargo. The `--root` flag specifies that the uninstallation should be performed on the project at the specified root directory and its dependencies.

            When you run `cargo uninstall --root <path-to-project>`, it will recursively remove all the installed packages in the given Rust project, including their sub-dependencies. This command is often used when you want to completely clear out a project's dependency tree and start fresh or when transitioning between different package versions or dependencies.
