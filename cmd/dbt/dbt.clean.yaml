flags:
    --profile=: Which profile to load. Overrides setting in dbt_project.yml
    --project-dir=: Which directory to look in for the dbt_project.yml file
    --vars=: Supply variables to the project
    -t, --target=: Which target to load for the given profile
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `dbt clean` is a command used in dbt (data build tool), an open-source data transformation and modeling toolkit. It is utilized to delete generated artifacts, specifically the materialized tables and snapshots created by running previous `dbt run` or `dbt test` commands. This can help save storage space and improve performance by rebuilding fresh tables when running subsequent data transformation tasks.'
    flag:
        profile: '[AI] `dbt clean --profile` is a command used in dbt (data build tool), an open-source data transformation and testing toolkit. The `clean` action removes all generated files, including materialized tables and snapshots, from the target database or output directory. Adding the `--profile` option specifies which dbt profile to use when executing the command, allowing you to apply different connection configurations for various environments.'
        project-dir: '[AI] `dbt clean --project-dir` is a command used in dbt (data build tool), an open-source data transformation and testing tool. This command is used to delete generated output files such as artifacts, snapshots, and materialized views that result from running `dbt run`. It ensures that the project starts with a clean slate for every new run. The `--project-dir` option specifies the directory where the dbt project is located.'
        target: '[AI] `dbt clean --target` is a command used in dbt (Data Build Tool), an open-source data transformation and testing toolkit. This command is responsible for deleting the output files generated by previous data model builds that match the specified target. The ''--target'' option allows you to clean specific targets, making it useful when you want to maintain a clean environment or prepare for a new build with different configurations.'
        vars: '[AI] `dbt clean --vars` is a command used in dbt (data build tool), an open-source data transformation and testing platform. This command cleans the output directory of previously materialized SQL queries and artifacts, removing unnecessary files. The `--vars` option allows you to pass key-value pairs as variables for use in your dbt models or tests. By doing this, you can modify the behavior of your scripts without changing the code itself, making it a useful feature for dynamic configurations.'
