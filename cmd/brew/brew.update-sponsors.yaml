    command: '[AI] The `brew update-sponsors` command is a Homebrew (a popular package manager for macOS) subcommand used to synchronize your local list of Homebrew sponsor keys with the latest available keys in the official Homebrew repository. By updating the sponsor keys, you ensure that you can continue to authentically install and upgrade packages from the tap (distribution channel) associated with those keys. This command is typically run periodically as a best practice to maintain a secure and up-to-date Homebrew installation.'

        quiet: |-
            [AI] The command `brew update-sponsors --quiet` is used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to fetch and install new sponsor commits from Homebrew tap repositories. "Sponsor commits" are changes made by the original authors of Homebrew recipes, which may include updates to formulas or dependencies.

            By running `update-sponsors`, Homebrew will check for any available sponsor commits and install them silently, without displaying progress messages or other notifications. The `--quiet` option suppresses all output except error messages, making the command run in the background with minimal interaction.
        verbose: '[AI] The `brew update-sponsors --verbose` command is used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command updates the list of Homebrew formulae and their associated sponsors in the local Homebrew repository to ensure it matches the latest changes on GitHub.
