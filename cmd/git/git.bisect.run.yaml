description: run script to automatically bisect
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git bisect run` is a Git command used to automatically find the commit that introduced a bug. It starts a bisect session and then runs a test script or command you provide, with each commit in between the current branch and the last known good commit being tested. Once the script passes, Git continues testing newer commits until it finds the commit that caused the failure. This command is helpful when trying to identify the commit that introduced a regression.'
