    command: '[AI] `git notes` is a Git command used to view, manage, and interact with annotations or notes attached to specific commit messages in a Git repository. With this command, you can create, list, show, edit, or delete notes associated with commits. These notes provide a way to add metadata or additional context to specific commits, making it easier to keep track of important information within the repository.'
    flag:
        ref: '[AI] The `git notes --ref` command is used to show the refs (references) in Git that point to notes. A Git note is an annotated tag with a body, similar to a commit message but longer and immutable. Refs are references to commits or other objects in Git. By combining these two concepts, `git notes --ref` command lists the refs that are associated with Git notes, allowing you to easily manage and access them.'
