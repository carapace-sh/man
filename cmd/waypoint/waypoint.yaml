    command: '[AI] The "waypoint" command in navigation systems refers to a specific location or point designated for reaching or passing by during a journey.

        autocomplete-install: '[AI] `waypoint` is a tool for managing local Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers. The `--autocomplete-install` flag is an option used with the `install` subcommand, which installs or upgrades Waypoint in your system. Specifically, it configures your terminal''s autocompletion feature to work with Waypoint commands. This can make interacting with Waypoint more efficient by providing suggested completions as you type.'

This flag can be passed when you install or update Waypoint using a tool like `kubectl`, `helm`, or other Kubernetes package managers. By running `waypoint install --autocomplete-uninstall`, you can choose to not install or remove the autocompletion files if they were previously installed, allowing you to customize your setup according to your preferences.'
        version: '[AI] The `waypoint` command with the `--version` flag is used to check for the current version of Waypoint, an open-source tool for managing and securing Kubernetes applications. When executed, it will print out the version number of Waypoint installed on the system.'
