documentation:
    command: '[AI] `brew generate-cask-api` is a Homebrew command used to generate an API key for Homebrew Cask, which is Homebrew''s package manager for macOS applications. The generated API key allows automated installations and updates of Cask packages using the Brewfile configuration file. This command is typically used by developers building continuous integration systems or other automated workflows, allowing them to manage software dependencies efficiently and consistently.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] The command `brew generate-cask-api --debug` is a Homebrew (a popular package manager for macOS) subcommand used to create or regenerate the Cask API, which is an interface for interacting with Homebrew Cask formulas programmatically. The `--debug` flag enables detailed debugging information during the process, allowing developers to diagnose any potential issues that may arise. This command generates or updates the API files, ensuring they are in sync with the latest Cask formula definitions.'
        dry-run: '[AI] `brew generate-cask-api --dry-run` is a Homebrew command used to generate a new Cask API specification file for a Homebrew formula, without making any changes to the repository or installing anything. The `--dry-run` option simulates the operation and shows what would be done if the command were run without this option. It does not create or modify any files in the file system.'
        help: '[AI] `brew generate-cask-api --help` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command generates documentation in Markdown format for creating and managing Homebrew Cask (a plugin for managing large apps) APIs. The `--help` flag displays detailed information about how to use this command correctly, including available options and their meanings.'
        quiet: '[AI] `brew generate-cask-api --quiet` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This specific command generates a new Homebrew Cask API key in quiet mode. The API key is used to authenticate automated builds and tests in Homebrew''s Cask ecosystem. By using the `--quiet` option, the terminal output during key generation will be suppressed.'
        verbose: '[AI] The command `brew generate-cask-api --verbose` is used to generate a new Cask API key for Homebrew, an open-source package manager for macOS. The `--verbose` flag increases the level of output detail during the command execution. The `generate-cask-api` subcommand creates and shows a new Cask API token, which can be used to authenticate with Homebrew''s Cask service for managing custom formulae and taps.'
