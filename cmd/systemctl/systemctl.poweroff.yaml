group: system
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl poweroff` is a Linux command used to gracefully shut down the entire system, stopping all running processes and cleaning up any temporary files before powering off. It utilizes the systemd system and service manager to perform an ordered shutdown sequence following the configured system initialization and runlevel settings. This command is typically executed with root privileges for security reasons, and it provides a controlled and orderly way to power down a Linux system instead of using a hard power switch.'
