    command: '[AI] The `tofu state list` command is not a standard Linux or Unix command. It seems to be specific to the Tofu filesystem, which is a union filesystem designed for live CDs and persistence layers in cloud-init. This command would likely display the current state of mounted Tofu filesystems with information such as source path, mount point, and options used.'
    flag:
        id: '[AI] The "tofu state list -id" is a command or argument used in Kubernetes to retrieve details about a specific stateful set, identified by its "id." Stateful sets are a type of Kubernetes deployment that ensures stable, replicated stateful applications with ordered and unique network identities. This command displays the current state, including desired replicas, current replicas, readiness, and other status information for that particular stateful set instance.'
        state: '[AI] The `tofu state list --state` command is a utility in Kubernetes used to display the current state of Tufd (TUF DataRolls), which is a tool for managing immutable, incremental, and secure configuration data. Tufd uses the TUF (The Update Framework) protocol to fetch and verify updates from remote servers. This command shows details about each data roll in the list, such as its name, version, last update time, and hash information, helping users monitor and manage their Tufd configurations.'
