    command: |-
        [AI] The `charml` command with the argument "name" is not a standard Unix or Linux command. It seems to be specific to Charmed Kubernetes Operators, which are Ansible-based Kubernetes applications designed for easy and consistent deployment and management of complex stateful applications on Kubernetes.

        With this command, you can list all available Charmed Operator names in your environment. For instance, running `charml name` without any arguments might return a list like: `mysql-operators keystone-operator openstack-mongo-operator ...`.

        Each listed name corresponds to the name of a specific Charmed Operator that can be installed and managed using the Ansible-based deployment workflow.
