documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl halt` is a command used in Linux systems to gracefully stop (halt) the running system, initiating a controlled shutdown process. This command sends a TERM signal followed by a KILL signal if necessary to all active processes, saves open files and buffers, and shuts down the system services in an orderly fashion. It''s equivalent to using the init 0 command, but with more modern systemd initialization systems, `systemctl halt` is the recommended method for shutting down your Linux machine.'
