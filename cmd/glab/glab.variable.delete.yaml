    command: '[AI] The `glab` command with the `variable delete` subcommand is used to remove a GitLab CI/CD variable from your project''s configuration. When you run this command, you need to specify the name of the variable as an argument. This action deletes the variable and makes it no longer available for use in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file or other pipeline jobs. This can be helpful when you accidentally add unnecessary variables or want to update your configuration with new settings while keeping old ones as references.'
    flag:
        group: |-
            [AI] The `flag "glab variable delete --group"` is used in GitLab to delete a specific variable or a group of variables from a GitLab CI/CD project.

            The `--group` option specifies that you want to delete an entire group of variables, rather than just a single one. When you use this command, you'll need to provide the name or ID of the variable group.

            For example:

            ```sh
            glab variable delete --group my_variable_group --project my_project_name
            ```

            This command will delete the entire 'my\_variable\_group' in the 'my\_project\_name' project. It is important to note that this action is permanent, and once deleted, the variables cannot be recovered unless you have a backup or have made a mistake during execution.
        scope: |-
            [AI] The `glab variable delete` command is used to delete a GitLab CI/CD variable in GitLab. The `--scope` option specifies the scope of the variable deletion:

            1. `--local`: Deletes the variable only from the current project's `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
            2. `--group`: Deletes the variable from all projects within a specific group.
            3. `--project`: Deletes the variable from a single GitLab project. By default, it deletes from the current project.
            4. `--global`: Deletes the variable from all projects across an entire GitLab account.

            This command is typically used when you no longer need a specific variable in your pipelines and want to remove it from your GitLab configuration.
