    command: '[AI] The `nmcli` is a powerful networking management command-line tool in Linux systems. The `nmcli general permissions` command is used to manage network connection profiles'' permissions for regular users. It allows you to add, remove, or modify the user and group permissions for a specific network profile. This command helps ensure that only authorized users have access to certain network connections. For example, `nmcli general permission add <profile> user <username> read` would give a user read-only access to a specific network profile.'
