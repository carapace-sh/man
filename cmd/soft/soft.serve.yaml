    command: '[AI] The term "soft serve" refers to a type of ice cream that is served softly and smoothly from an ice cream machine, creating a distinctive swirl shape. Soft serve is usually sweeter and creamier than traditional scooped ice cream due to its high milkfat content and the absence of air being incorporated during freezing. It can be enjoyed in a cone or a cup, sometimes topped with sauces, sprinkles, or other sweet garnishes. Soft serve is commonly associated with ice cream trucks, carnivals, and fast-food chains.'
