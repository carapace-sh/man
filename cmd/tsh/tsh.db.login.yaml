    --db-user=: Optional database user to configure as default.

    command: '[AI] The `tsh db login` command is used in Tenable Security Center''s Tenable Security Hub (TSH) to authenticate and connect to a Tenable Data Source, such as a Database or Log Server, for data collection and analysis. It requires specifying the correct credentials of the database instance being accessed. This command is typically run in a TSH script or as part of an automated workflow to ensure secure and efficient data gathering for vulnerability management and security monitoring.'
    flag:
        db-name: |-
            [AI] The `tsh` command with the argument `db login --db-name` is a part of TeraTerm SSH (Secure Shell) client, which is used for secure remote access to servers or clients over an unsecured network.

            This specific command sequence is used to connect to a MySQL or MariaDB database server using the Terminal SSH session. The `--db-name` flag specifies the name of the target database on that server, which will be used when authenticating with the database management system. The connection details such as host address, username, and password are typically configured beforehand in the TeraTerm SSH session settings or passed through command line arguments.
        db-user: |-
            [AI] The `tsh` command with the argument `db login --db-user` is a part of the TeraTerm SSH (Secure Shell) client, which is used to establish secure connections between two untrusted networks. In this specific case, the command is used for logging into a MySQL or MariaDB database server using SSH keys for authentication. The `--db-user` flag indicates that the following argument is the username for the database user account. So, this command would look like:

            ```bash
            tsh db login <SSH_USERNAME>@<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT> --db-user <DATABASE_USERNAME>
            ```

            Replace `<SSH_USERNAME>`, `<IP_ADDRESS>`, and `<PORT>` with the appropriate values, and `<DATABASE_USERNAME>` with the username for the database account you wish to connect to. The SSH keys are used to authenticate the connection to the database server while the `--db-user` flag is used to specify the database user account that you want to log into once the secure connection has been established.
