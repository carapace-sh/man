name: disconnect [OPTIONS] NETWORK CONTAINER
description: Disconnect a container from a network
flags:
    -f, --force: Force the container to disconnect from a network
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker network disconnect` command is used to remove a container from a Docker network without removing the container itself. When you run this command, the container will no longer be reachable through the network, but it will still exist and can be started again later if needed. This can be useful in situations where you want to isolate a container from a network while keeping it running for other reasons. The syntax is `docker network disconnect <network> <container>`.'
    flag:
        force: '[AI] The `docker network disconnect --force` command is used to forcibly remove a container or node from a Docker network. When the `--force` option is used, Docker will not wait for any containers on the node to gracefully shut down before removing them. This can be useful when trying to remove a problematic node or container from a network without waiting for it to finish shutting down naturally. However, using this command may result in data loss or other unintended consequences if used on containers that are actively writing data.'
