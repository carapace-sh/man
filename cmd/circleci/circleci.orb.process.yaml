        [AI] `circleci orb` is a command used in CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform. An Orb is a reusable collection of CircleCI scripts and configurations. The `orb process` command is used to install or update an Orb from the CircleCI registry into your CircleCI project's workflow. For example:

        ```
        version: 2.1
        jobs:
          install_orb:
            jobs:
              - name: Install MyOrb
                orb: myusername/myorb:@latest
        ```

        In the above configuration file, the `install_orb` job will run the `Install MyOrb` command which installs or updates the specified Orb (`myusername/myorb`) in the CircleCI environment for further use in your workflow.
