documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `apropos` command in Unix-based systems is used to search for commands or manual pages based on a given keyword or pattern. It searches through the command names and the short descriptions of installed packages, returning a list of matching results. For example, `apropos man database` will return a list of commands related to databases in the manual pages.'
    flag:
        and: '[AI] The `--and` flag in `apt-get`, a Debian package management tool, is used to specify that only packages matching both a given search term (using the `apt-cache search` command) and having a specific property (such as architecture or dependency) will be displayed. This means that the search results must satisfy both conditions: the name or description must include the search term, and the property must match the specified value.'
        config-file: '[AI] The `apropos` command in Unix-based systems is used to search for commands or manual pages based on given keywords. The option `--config-file <filename>` is used to specify a custom configuration file for the `apropos` utility. This file can contain additional words or phrases to be searched for, as well as other configuration options. By default, `apropos` uses the system-wide configuration file located in `/etc/apropos.conf`. Using `--config-file <filename>` allows users to customize the search to better suit their needs.'
        debug: '[AI] `apropos --debug` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to search man pages for specific keywords. The `--debug` flag is an optional argument that enables debug mode, providing more detailed output and error messages when using the `apropos` command. This can be useful for troubleshooting or understanding the internal workings of the command.'
        exact: '[AI] The `apropos` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to search manual pages based on a given keyword or regular expression. The `--exact` option refines this search by only returning exact matches of the specified keyword, instead of returning matches that contain the keyword as a substring. This can be useful when you''re looking for a specific command or man page and don''t want irrelevant results cluttering up your output.'
        help: '[AI] The `apropos` command is a text search utility in Unix-like operating systems. The `--help` option is used to display detailed help information about how to use the `apropos` command, including available options and their functions. For example, running `apropos --help` will show you various usage examples, explain what each flag does, and provide other relevant information.'
        locale: '[AI] `apropos` is a command-line utility in Unix-based systems used to search for commands or text strings in installed man pages (short for "manual pages"). The option `--locale` sets the locale for pattern matching and output formatting during the search. It ensures that the search term and the man page names are matched according to the specified locale''s rules, making the search results more accurate and user-friendly for users with non-English or localized settings.'
        long: '[AI] `apropos --long` is a command in Unix-like operating systems used to search man pages (manual pages) for keywords or phrases. The `--long` option increases the output''s verbosity, displaying longer and more descriptive matches. It shows not only the command names but also a brief explanation of what each command does, making it easier to understand which command is relevant to the search query.'
        manpath: |-
            [AI] The `--manpath` option in the `apropos` command is used to specify a custom manual page search path. By default, `apropos` searches for manual pages in the standard system directories. However, if you have manually installed or custom-built software with manual pages located in a different directory, you can use `--manpath` to include those directories in the search.

            For example, if you have manual pages stored in `/usr/local/share/man`, you can run:

            ```bash
            apropos --manpath=/usr/local/share/man "search term"
            ```

            This will search for manual pages in the specified directory and print out the matching man page names.
        regex: '[AI] `apropos` is a Unix command-line utility used to search for commands or manual pages based on their names or descriptions. The option `--regex` enables regular expression matching for the search pattern. So, instead of searching for an exact match, you can use regular expressions to define more complex search queries. For instance, if you want to find all commands that have "edit" in their description, you could type `apropos edit`, but with `--regex` you could also search for more specific patterns such as `apropos --regex ''.*edit.*''`. This allows for powerful and flexible searching capabilities.'
        section: '[AI] The `apropos` command in Unix-based systems is used to search for manual pages based on a given keyword or regular expression. The `--section` option is an argument that can be passed to `apropos` to limit the search to specific sections of the manual pages. For instance, if you want to find commands related to networking, you can use `apropos --section="network" <keyword>`. This will only return the manual pages belonging to the "network" section.'
        sections: '[AI] `apropos --sections` is a command in GNU textutils used to search man pages for specific keywords or phrases. The `--sections` option filters the search result based on the section of the man page. Sections define the type and scope of a man page, such as user commands (1), system calls (2), libraries (3), and so on. By providing one or more sections with this option, `apropos` will only return results from those sections, making the search result more focused and efficient.'
        systems: '[AI] The `apropos` command with the `--systems` option is used in Unix-like operating systems to search for manual pages (or manpages) that contain specific strings within their titles or sections. The `--systems` flag specifically searches only in the system-wide manual page database, rather than in the user''s personal manual pages. This helps users locate important commands and utilities that are installed across the entire system.'
        usage: |-
            [AI] `apropos --usage` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to search for commands or manual pages based on their documentation descriptions. The `--usage` option specifically displays the usage message of a given command or utility, which explains how to use it correctly along with any available options and arguments.

            So when you run `apropos --usage`, it won't provide any search results but instead will display the help text for using the `apropos` command itself. To search for specific commands or documentation, use `apropos [keyword]`.
        verbose: '[AI] The `apropos` command with the `--verbose` flag is used to search the man pages database for keywords or phrases. With the `--verbose` option, `apropos` provides more detailed output, including the full path of the man page and a brief description of the utility. In other words, it gives a verbose listing of the matching man pages instead of just their names.'
        version: |-
            [AI] `apropos` is a command-line utility in Unix-based systems used to search man pages for specific keywords. The `--version` option is used to display the current version of the `apropos` program installed on your system. When you type `apropos --version` in the terminal, it returns an output similar to:

            ```bash
            apropos (YYYYMMDD)
            [version]
            ```

            Replace `[version]` with the specific version number of the `apropos` application installed. This information can be helpful when you need to check for updates or troubleshoot issues related to your current installation.
        wildcard: '[AI] The `--wildcard` option in the `apropos` command of Unix-like operating systems is used to search man pages with a partial word match, as if it was using a regular expression. Instead of requiring an exact match for the search term, `--wildcard` allows for matches that contain the searched string anywhere within the man page description. This can be particularly useful when searching for commands or functions whose names or descriptions only partially match the desired query.'
