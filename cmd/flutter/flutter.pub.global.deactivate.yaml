    command: '[AI] `flutter pub global deactivate` is a command used in Flutter development to disable global packages managed by `flutter pub`, which is the default package manager for the Flutter framework. Global packages are plugins or other tools that can be installed and used across multiple projects instead of per-project, and they''re typically installed via the `global_packages` section in a project''s `pubspec.yaml`. Running this command disables the use and availability of all currently enabled global packages for the current shell session. This command helps you manage your global packages installations, allowing you to activate/deactivate as per your requirements.'

            [AI] `flutter pub global deactivate` is a command used in the Flutter framework for managing global packages, which are packages installed for use across multiple projects rather than within a specific project. The "--help" option displays detailed information about how to use this command, including its purpose and available options.

            The `deactivate` command itself is used to unregister or deactivate a previously activated (global) package, meaning that the package will no longer be accessible across all projects by default. This can be useful for managing global packages, as it allows you to easily add, remove, or modify the list of active packages as needed.

            The `--help` option displays detailed information on how to use this command, including available options and their usage. Some common options include specifying a package name to deactivate using the `--name` option or deactivating all global packages with no arguments. By providing `--help`, you'll get a clear understanding of how to use this command effectively in your Flutter development workflow.
