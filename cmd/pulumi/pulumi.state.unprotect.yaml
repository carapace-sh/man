documentation:
    command: '[AI] `pulumi state unprotect` is a command used in Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform, to remove protection from one or more resources in the current state. By default, Pulumi sets resources as protected when they are out of sync with your deployed infrastructure. Using this command allows you to forcefully modify those resources without being prompted for confirmation first. This command should be used with caution to avoid unintended changes to your infrastructure configuration.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `pulumi state unprotect --all` is a command in Pulumi, an infrastructure as code toolkit, that modifies the access control settings of all resources managed by Pulumi in a project. Specifically, it removes any protection on these resources'' state, allowing anyone with access to the Pulumi project to make changes to the current configuration and apply them as new deployments. This command can be useful when multiple team members need to collaborate closely on managing infrastructure but should be used with caution as it allows for unintended modifications if not carefully managed.'
        "yes": '[AI] `pulumi state unprotect --yes` is a command used in Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform. This command removes the protection on a specific resource or stack in the Pulumi state file. When resources are protected, they cannot be modified or deleted through Pulumi unless explicitly unprotected. The `--yes` flag is used to confirm the operation without further prompting.'
