    command: '[AI] `systemctl cat` is a command used in Linux systems to display the content of a service file without actually enabling or disabling it. The command retrieves the content from the journal files instead of directly reading the file from its location under /etc/systemd/. This allows users to view the current configuration of a service without making any changes, which can be useful for troubleshooting purposes.'
