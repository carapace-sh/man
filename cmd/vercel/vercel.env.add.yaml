documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vercel env add` is a command provided by Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, used to set environment variables for a project. The command adds or updates environment variable values in the .env.local file in your project directory which is then deployed along with your code. It''s particularly useful when you have sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, etc., that shouldn''t be committed to version control but need to be accessible in the production environment.'
