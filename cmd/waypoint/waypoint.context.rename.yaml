documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint context rename` command in Terraform is used to rename an existing module or working directory context within Terraform Workspaces. Contexts help to manage multiple deployments of the same configuration by providing a way to easily switch between them. By renaming a context, you can update the name to better reflect the configuration being managed. This command modifies the `terraform.tfvars` or `terraform.hcl` file to update the context block with the new name.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The `waypoint context rename --app` command is used with Waypoint, an open-source application delivery platform from Microsoft. This command allows renaming of an existing application context in Waypoint. Contexts represent environments or deployment targets, and their names must be unique within a cluster. By using this command with the `--app` flag, you specify that you want to rename only the application context, leaving the base context name unchanged.'
        plain: '[AI] The `waypoint context rename --plain` command is a part of Kubernetes'' `kubectl` tool, which is used to configure and manage clusters and applications running in containers. This specific command is used to rename the current context in your `kubeconfig` file, which represents a cluster connection with specific configuration details like user authentication and API endpoint. The `--plain` flag indicates that the output of the command should be in plain text format rather than JSON or YAML. So, this command will simply rename the context without any additional formatting or extra information printed out.'
        project: '[AI] The `waypoint context rename --project` command in Waypoint, an open-source application delivery platform by Docker, is used to rename the current project context. Project contexts represent the set of configurations and environments associated with a specific project. Renaming the project context allows users to better organize their projects within Waypoint. The new name should be provided as an argument to the command. For instance, `waypoint context rename --project my-project old-name`.'
        workspace: '[AI] The `waypoint context rename --workspace` command is used in the Waypoint tool for Kubernetes to rename an existing workspace context. A workspace context represents a connection to a cluster or environment, and renaming it can help keep your configuration organized. The full command syntax is `waypoint config rename <old-context-name> <new-context-name> --workspace`. This changes the name of the specified workspace context from `old-context-name` to `new-context-name`.'
