    flag:
        detach: '[AI] `calibre --detach` is a command used in Calibre, an open-source e-book library management software. This command starts Calibre in detached mode, meaning it runs as a background service without opening the graphical user interface (GUI). The main purpose of using this command is to run Calibre automatically or as a service, for instance, on a headless server or in a script. By not opening the GUI, system resources are saved and the application can focus solely on managing and processing e-books.'
        help: '[AI] `calibre --help` is a command used in Calibre e-book management software to display a help message. This message provides detailed information about how to use Calibre, including various commands and options for performing tasks such as adding books to the library, converting formats, synchronizing with e-readers, and more. The help message also includes brief descriptions and usage examples for each option and command. It''s an essential resource for users who want to understand the capabilities of Calibre and how to utilize them effectively.'
        ignore-plugins: '[AI] `calibre --ignore-plugins` is a command-line option for Calibre, an open-source e-book library and management tool. This option disables the loading of plugins during Calibre''s startup process. By ignoring plugins, you may bypass issues related to incompatible or problematic plugins, potentially improving the stability and performance of Calibre when dealing with large collections or specific file formats.'
        no-update-check: '[AI] `calibre --no-update-check` is a command-line option used with Calibre, an open-source e-book library manager. This option disables Calibre from performing automatic updates checks during its operation. By using `--no-update-check`, the user can prevent Calibre from downloading or installing new versions or add-ons without explicit consent, which may be desired for security reasons or to maintain a specific feature set.'
        shutdown-running-calibre: '[AI] The command `calibre --shutdown-running-calibre` is used to forcibly shut down an already running Calibre instance. Calibre is a popular open-source e-book library and management software. By using this command, you can terminate any active Calibre processes, ensuring that there are no conflicts or inconsistencies between multiple instances of the application. It''s important to note that unsaved changes in one instance might be lost when forcefully shutting down, so save your work before using this command if necessary.'
        start-in-tray: '[AI] The `--start-in-tray` option in Calibre is used to configure Calibre''s library management behavior when adding new books. When this option is set, Calibre will place the newly added books into the "Incoming" or "New Arrivals" tray instead of directly importing them into the library. This allows users to review and process the new files before they are fully integrated into the library. The user can then choose to keep, delete, or modify the metadata for each file in the tray before moving it to the main library.'
        verbose: '[AI] `calibre --verbose` is a command-line option used with Calibre, an e-book library manager. The `--verbose` flag increases the amount of output Calibre produces during its operation, providing more detailed information about what it''s doing. This can be helpful for troubleshooting or for those who want to better understand the inner workings of the application.'
        version: '[AI] `calibre --version` is a command used in Calibre e-book software to display the current version number of the installed application. When run, it prints out the major and minor release numbers, as well as any build identifiers or extra information such as the operating system it''s running on. This can be helpful for checking if your Calibre installation is up-to-date or not.'
        with-library: '[AI] The `--with-library` option in Calibre is used when building or installing Calibre from source code. It specifies the location of Calibre''s library directory, which contains various plugins and customizations for Calibre. By providing this option during the installation process, you can customize your Calibre installation with specific plugins or configurations that are not included in the standard distribution. This allows for greater flexibility in tailoring Calibre to suit your unique needs.'
