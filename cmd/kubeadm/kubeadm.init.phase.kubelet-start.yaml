name: kubelet-start
description: Write kubelet settings and (re)start the kubelet
flags:
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --cri-socket=: Path to the CRI socket to connect. If empty kubeadm will try to auto-detect this value; use this option only if you have more than one CRI installed or if you have non-standard CRI socket.
    --node-name=: Specify the node name.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubeadm init phase kubelet-start` is a command used in Kubernetes to start the Kubelet service after initializing a new Kubernetes cluster with `kubeadm init`. The Kubelet is a system daemon that runs on each node in the cluster and is responsible for maintaining the pods'' desired state, communicating with the master component for the scheduling of workloads, and enforcing the container runtime security policies. The `phase kubelet-start` command starts or restarts the Kubelet service to ensure it''s running correctly in the cluster.'
    flag:
        config: '[AI] `kubeadm init` is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The specified subcommand, `phase kubelet-start`, triggers the process of starting the Kubelets (kubelet and container-runtime) on the worker nodes. This is an essential step after initializing the master node as the Kubelets manage the containers and nodes'' pods and ensure cluster components'' health. The `--config` option specifies a file that contains additional configuration details for the kubelet, such as the location of the certificates, client CA certificate, and authorization plugin.'
        cri-socket: |-
            [AI] The command `kubeadm init phase kubelet-start --cri-socket` is a part of the Kubernetes initialization process using `kubeadm`, which is a tool for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters.

            The `--cri-socket` option specifies the Unix domain socket for the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). This interface allows Kubernetes to communicate with the container runtime, such as Docker or CRI-O, for managing containers within the cluster.

            The `kubelet-start` subcommand tells `kubeadm` to start the Kubelet, which is a key component in every Kubernetes node that runs containers and manages the nodes' resources. By starting the Kubelet with the specified CRI socket, the Kubernetes cluster will be able to create and manage containers effectively.
        node-name: '[AI] The `kubeadm init` command is used to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. The specific phase mentioned, `kubelet-start --node-name`, instructs the system to start the Kubelet service on a node that will become part of the cluster. The `--node-name` flag identifies the current node being configured during the `kubeadm init` process. After starting the Kubelet, the node will register itself with the Kubernetes master and join the cluster, enabling it to run containerized workloads.'
