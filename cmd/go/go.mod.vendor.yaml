    command: '[AI] `go mod vendor` is a Go module command used to download and install the exact versions of dependencies defined in the `go.mod` file into a separate `vendor` directory, ensuring consistency across different environments. This can be useful for projects that depend on specific versioned packages or when using multiple versions of the same package within a single project.'

            [AI] `go mod vendor -v` is a command used in Go programming language for managing dependencies. The `go mod` tool is part of the Go standard library and is used to manage a Go module's dependency tree, download new dependencies, and build the project.

            The `vendor` subcommand creates a `vendor/` directory within your Go module, downloads all necessary dependencies into it, and sets up import paths in your source code to use these local copies instead of remote ones. By adding the `-v` flag, you'll get verbose output displaying each dependency being downloaded with its version number and checksum for easier tracking and debugging purposes.
