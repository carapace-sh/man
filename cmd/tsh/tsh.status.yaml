            [AI] `tsh` is a command-line tool for managing and monitoring systemd services and systemd targets in Linux. The `status` subcommand is used to query the current state of a service or target.

            The option `--format` allows specifying a custom output format using placeholders. For example, `"--format=%F %S %M %L %Z %P"` will display the full path, service name, machine ID, load status, and process ID respectively. You can customize this format string to suit your needs.
        no-verbose: '[AI] `tsh` is a command-line tool for managing Traffic Server, an open-source reverse proxy and caching system by Apache. The `status` command with the `--no-verbose` option returns a succinct list of current Traffic Server processes, their statuses (running or not), and their process IDs. It does not provide detailed information about each process, keeping the output minimal and easy to parse.'
        verbose: |-
            [AI] `tsh` is a common alias for the `tssh` or `tarantoolsh` command-line tool used to manage and interact with Tarantool databases. The `status` subcommand displays information about the running Tarantool clusters or servers.

            The `--verbose` option increases the level of detail provided in the output. Specifically, it provides more information on the current state of each space and schema, including statistics such as memory usage, number of records, and open transactions. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues related to resource utilization or performance.
