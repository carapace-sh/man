flags:
    --cached: Print the cached linkage values stored in `HOMEBREW_CACHE`, set by a previous `brew linkage` run.
    --debug: Display any debugging information.
    --help: Show this message.
    --quiet: Make some output more quiet.
    --reverse: For every library that a keg references, print its dylib path followed by the binaries that link to it.
    --strict: Exit with a non-zero status if any undeclared dependencies with linkage are found.
    --test: Show only missing libraries and exit with a non-zero status if any missing libraries are found.
    --verbose: Make some output more verbose.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `brew link` is a Homebrew command used to create hard links for Homebrew-installed packages in their respective Cellar directories to the prefix directory (usually /usr/local), making them ready for use without keeping the original installations in the Cellar. This allows for easy removal and upgrades of packages by managing symlinks instead.'
    flag:
        cached: '[AI] `brew linkage --cached` is a Homebrew command used to manage symlinks for installed packages. The `--cached` option shows a list of outdated or broken linked packages without actually updating them. These packages may have issues with their dependencies or paths, and need to be manually fixed or relinked using other Homebrew commands. The output will display each package name, its current link path, and the expected link path, helping users identify and resolve any discrepancies between the installed package''s location and Homebrew''s desired linkage.'
        debug: |-
            [AI] `brew linkage --debug` is a command used with Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `linkage` sub-command manages symlinks between installed packages and their required dependencies.

            The `--debug` flag is an optional argument that instructs Homebrew to output detailed debug information while performing the linkage operation. This can be helpful in troubleshooting installation or linking issues. Without `--debug`, Homebrew will perform the command silently, without displaying additional information.
        help: |-
            [AI] `brew linkage` is a command provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. The `--help` option is used to display detailed information about how to use this specific command.

            The `brew linkage` command is used to manage the creation of symlinks between installed Homebrew packages and their corresponding binaries or libraries. It can be used to create new symlinks, update existing ones, or remove unwanted symlinks. By default, Homebrew creates local symlinks during installation, but you can use `brew linkage` to manage them.

            Here's a brief summary of the available sub-commands when using `brew linkage --help`:

            - `brew linkage [--force] [--link] [--unlink] [formula...]`: Link, force-link or unlink one or more Homebrew formulae.
            - `brew linkage update`: Update all existing symlinks to point to the latest version of the installed formula.
            - `brew linkage cleanup`: Remove any stale or unnecessary symlinks.
            - `brew linkage list`: Display a list of currently managed symlinks and their corresponding Homebrew formulae.

            These sub-commands can be further customized with various options, such as `--force`, which forces the creation or removal of a symlink regardless of existing symlinks or the presence of the original binary/library, or `--link` and `--unlink`, which specifically create or remove a symlink without updating it.
        quiet: '[AI] `brew link` is a Homebrew command used to create hard links between installed Homebrew packages and their required dependencies in the /usr/local directory. The `--quiet` option is used to suppress informational messages during the linking process. So, `brew linkage --quiet` creates the necessary links silently without printing any output.'
        reverse: |-
            [AI] `brew linkage --reverse` is a command provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux systems. This command is used to manage the linking between Homebrew-installed packages and their dependencies.

            The `--reverse` flag reverses the linking process. By default, when you install a package using Homebrew, its dependencies are also installed if they are not already present. In this case, the `brew linkage --reverse` command does the opposite: it uninstalls the installed packages and their dependencies, but leaves their symlinks in place. This can be useful when you want to remove packages and their dependencies while keeping their directories for some reason.

            However, note that using this command might result in broken dependencies or missing functionality if the packages being removed are essential for other installed packages. Therefore, it's crucial to exercise caution when executing this command.
        strict: '[AI] `brew link` is a Homebrew command used to install and link software from the Homebrew repository into your system. The `--strict` option that follows this command ensures that only dependencies that are required for the installation of a specific package will be linked, without any optional or suggested dependencies. This helps to keep the installed software lean and avoid unnecessary dependencies.'
        test: |-
            [AI] `brew linkage --test` is a Homebrew command used to check if there are any broken symlinks in the system. When you install software with Homebrew, it creates symbolic links (symlinks) to the actual binaries or libraries located in the Homebrew Cellar. These symlinks are then added to directories like `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/sbin`.

            The `brew linkage --test` command scans through these symlinks and checks if they still point to valid files in the Homebrew Cellar. If it finds any broken or missing links, it will print an error message for each affected symbolic link, helping you identify and fix potential issues with your Homebrew installation.
        verbose: '[AI] `brew link` is a Homebrew command used to create links between installed Homebrew packages and their corresponding binaries in /usr/local. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output displayed during the linking process, providing more detailed information about what files are being linked and where they are being linked to. This can be helpful for troubleshooting or understanding the installation process in greater detail.'
