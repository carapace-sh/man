    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `brew cleanup --debug` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command triggers Homebrew''s cleanup process with debug mode enabled. The cleanup process scans for and safely deletes unused installations, old bottles, and other unnecessary files.

        dry-run: '[AI] `brew cleanup --dry-run` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command performs a simulation of the `brew cleanup` action without actually deleting anything. The purpose of this command is to show you which outdated and unused files and directories Homebrew would delete if you were to run `brew cleanup` without the `--dry-run` option. This can help ensure that you are comfortable with what will be deleted before running the command in its full capacity.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `brew cleanup` is a command offered by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS and Linux. The `--help` option provides information about how to use this command effectively.

            In simple terms, `brew cleanup` helps manage unused installed packages' resources, such as casks (graphical user interface applications) or tap repositories, by deleting their downloaded files that are no longer needed. This action is especially useful when these packages are uninstalled or not managed by Homebrew anymore. By running `brew cleanup`, you can save disk space and keep your system tidy.
        prune: '[AI] `brew cleanup --prune` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command helps manage the cellar, which is Homebrew''s depository for downloaded and installed packages. The `--prune` flag instructs Homebrew to remove any unused or outdated files from the cellar to save disk space and keep the system up-to-date. In essence, this command is used to clean up and maintain the Homebrew installation by removing unnecessary files.'
        prune-prefix: '[AI] The `brew cleanup --prune-prefix` command is a function in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, used to remove outdated or unused files and dependencies downloaded during Homebrew installation and upgrades. The `--prune-prefix` option specifically targets files with prefixes that are no longer needed due to removal of installed packages. In summary, it helps keep the system clean by safely removing unnecessary files, reducing disk space usage and clutter.'
        quiet: '[AI] `brew cleanup --quiet` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command is used to clean up outdated and unnecessary files left over from previously installed or failed package installations. The `--quiet` option suppresses the output of the command, meaning it runs without displaying any messages.'
        s: '[AI] The `brew cleanup` command is a function provided by Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to help manage and free up disk space by removing outdated or unnecessary files. The `-s` option stands for "dry-run" or "preview" mode. In this mode, the command will only display what files would be deleted without actually deleting them. This allows you to review the list of files that would be removed before deciding whether or not to proceed with the actual cleanup.'
        verbose: '[AI] `brew cleanup --verbose` is a command used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. This command helps manage outdated or unused files and caches by removing them to save disk space.
