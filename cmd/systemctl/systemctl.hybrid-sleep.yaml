description: Hibernate and suspend the system
group: system
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `systemctl` command with the `hybrid-sleep` argument is used to put a Linux system into a hybrid sleep state, also known as S3 or hibernation mode. This state allows the system to save its current state to the hard disk and then enter a low power mode, reducing power consumption without completely turning off the computer. When the system wakes up, it resumes from the saved state. It''s important to note that this functionality depends on hardware support and appropriate system configuration.'
