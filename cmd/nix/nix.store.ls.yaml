documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `nix store ls` command is used in the Nix Package Manager to list all the files and directories that are currently stored in the Nix store. The Nix store is where all the installed packages and their dependencies are kept. By default, it shows the paths to the stored items with their sizes and checksums for verification.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `nix store ls --debug` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command lists all the stored builds and configurations in the local Nix store, displaying detailed debug information. It helps system administrators and developers to diagnose issues related to package management and dependencies in Nix.'
        directory: '[AI] The `nix store ls --directory` command is a part of Nix Package Manager, which is used to list the contents of the Nix store, a centralized repository of software packages managed by Nix. The `--directory` option makes the output display only directories and their paths in the store. In other words, it lists the directories containing packages and their respective locations within the Nix store.'
        json: '[AI] `nix store ls --json` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command lists all the available store items (i.e., installed packages or configurations) in JSON format. The output includes details like the name, size, and SHA256 checksum of each item.'
        log-format: '[AI] The `nix store ls` command with the `--log-format` option is used to list Nix expressions and their associated hashes, but in log format. Log format means that the output will include timestamps and other metadata for each expression. This can be useful for tracking changes to a Nix expression over time or for debugging build issues. Each line in the output includes the timestamp of when the expression was last built, the hash of the expression''s output, and the path to the expression. The flags `--since` and `--until` can also be used with this command to filter the output based on a time range.'
        long: '[AI] The command `nix store ls --long` is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command lists all the items stored in the Nix store with detailed information. The `--long` option increases the output''s verbosity, displaying each item''s hash, size, path, and a brief description (if available). It helps in managing and identifying specific packages or files in the Nix store.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] `nix store ls --print-build-logs` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command lists all the built packages in the Nix store with their corresponding build logs. Build logs contain detailed information about the construction process of each package, including timestamps, output messages, and errors if any occurred during the build. The `--print-build-logs` option ensures that only the log file names are printed along with the relevant store paths, making it easier to review the build history or troubleshoot issues related to specific packages.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `nix store ls --quiet` command is a Nix expression used to list all files in the Nix store with minimal output. The `--quiet` option suppresses the display of headers and other extraneous information, resulting in only the file paths being printed.'
        recursive: '[AI] The `nix store ls` command is a part of Nix Package Manager, which is used to list files in the Nix store. The option `--recursive` (short form `-R`) tells the command to recursively list all files and directories within the given path. So, running `nix store ls --recursive <path>` will display a detailed listing of all contents under the specified path in the Nix store.'
        verbose: '[AI] The command `nix store ls --verbose` is used in Nix Package Manager to list all the stores and the contents of each store with detailed information. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output to include paths, sizes, and other metadata for each file. It provides a more comprehensive view of the files stored in the Nix expression evaluation result database.'
