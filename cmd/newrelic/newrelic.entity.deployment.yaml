description: Manage deployment markers for a New Relic entity
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `newrelic entity deployment` command is not a standard or universally recognized command. It seems to be specific to New Relic, a software analytics company. In their context, this command likely refers to deploying a new version or configuration of an application entity being monitored by New Relic. This action could involve updating code, configurations, or infrastructure, and the deployment command might trigger New Relic to start collecting performance data on the updated entity. The exact implementation and usage vary depending on the specific New Relic tool and environment being used.'
