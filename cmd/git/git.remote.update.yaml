description: Fetch updates for remote
flags:
    -p, --prune: prune remotes after fetching
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git remote update` is a Git command used to fetch and update the remote repositories'' branches and tags in your local repository. It fetches any new changes from the remote repository, but does not merge them into your current branch by default. This allows you to see what changes have been made without affecting your working directory unless you choose to do so.'
    flag:
        prune: '[AI] `git remote update --prune` is a Git command used to fetch and update the remote repositories, while also removing any stale remote branches that have been deleted from the origin but still exist locally. This helps keep your local repository in sync with the remote one by maintaining a clean list of branches under the ''remote'' tab in Git.'
