name: attach [OPTIONS] SERVICE
description: Attach local standard input, output, and error streams to a service's running container.
flags:
    --detach-keys=: Override the key sequence for detaching from a container.
    --index=: index of the container if service has multiple replicas.
    --no-stdin: Do not attach STDIN
    --sig-proxy: Proxy all received signals to the process
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker-compose attach` is a command used in Docker Compose projects to establish an interactive connection with a running container. It attaches the standard input, output, and error streams of a specified service or container to the current terminal session. This allows users to send commands directly to the container and see its output in real-time, making it useful for debugging or interacting with applications that require user input.'
    flag:
        detach-keys: '[AI] `docker-compose attach` is a command used with Docker Compose files to connect to running containers. The `--detach-keys` option specifies which signals, when sent to the container''s TTY, will cause the attached terminal to detach (i.e., be disconnected from). By default, this includes SIGTTOU and SIGTERM. Using `--detach-keys <signal>...` allows you to customize which signals result in detachment when sent to the container''s TTY while attached via `docker-compose attach`.'
        index: '[AI] `docker-compose attach --index` is a command used with Docker Compose to establish interactive connections with one or more containers in a running service, specified by their index order in the `docker-compose.yml` file. The command `attach` starts an attachment to the container''s standard input, output, and error streams, while the `--index` flag specifies which container to attach to based on its index number within the Compose file. This can be useful for managing multiple containers in a Compose environment and interacting with them individually.'
        no-stdin: '[AI] `docker-compose attach --no-stdin` is a command used with Docker Compose to establish an interactive terminal connection with one or more running containers. The `--no-stdin` flag prevents Docker from automatically sending input to the container, allowing you to interact manually instead. This can be useful when you want to monitor logs or perform specific tasks in the container without affecting its normal operation.'
        sig-proxy: '[AI] `docker-compose attach --sig-proxy` is a command used in Docker Compose to establish an interactive terminal connection with one or more running containers, forwarding both standard input, output, and error streams (STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR), as well as signals. The `--sig-proxy` flag allows the user to send signals directly to the container using the `kill` command, without having to use Docker''s `docks kill` command or the container ID. This can be useful when managing multiple containers and wanting to send signals uniformly through Compose.'
