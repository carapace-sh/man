documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `waypoint fmt` command is used in Navigator, a routing and navigation software for OpenStreetMap data, to format waypoints for import or export into other applications. It does not make any changes to the waypoints themselves but converts their representation from one format to another, such as between GPX (GPS Exchange Format) and OSM (OpenStreetMap) formats.'
    flag:
        app: '[AI] The command `waypoint fmt --app` is used with Waypoint, an open-source multi-cloud application delivery platform developed by Hashicorp. This command is for formatting application configurations based on the defined Waypoint application schema. By using `--app`, you specify which particular application''s configuration you want to format. The output will be in a human-readable YAML or HCL format, making it easier to review and understand changes before applying them.'
        plain: '[AI] The command `waypoint fmt --plain` is used with Waypoint, an open-source project management tool for Docker environments. This command formats your Waypoint configuration files according to the plain text format, which means it converts the files into a human-readable and simple text representation. By default, Waypoint uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) for configuration files, but this command allows you to view or work with the raw, unformatted text.'
        project: '[AI] The command `waypoint fmt --project` is used with Waypoint, an open-source tool for managing infrastructure as code (IaC) using Hashicorp''s HCL language. This specific command invokes the format action of Waypoint for a given project. It ensures that your files adhere to the expected configuration format and style. By using `--project`, you specify which project''s files you want to check, allowing you to work with multiple projects within the same Waypoint environment.'
        workspace: |-
            [AI] The `waypoint fmt --workspace` command is used with Waypoint, an open-source multi-cloud infrastructure automation tool. This specific command is for formatting Waypoint configuration files based on the currently active workspace.

            When you work with multiple environments or projects in Waypoint, each one can have its unique configurations and settings. The `--workspace` flag allows you to specify which workspace's configuration files should be used as the basis for the formatting command. This is helpful when collaborating with team members, switching between projects, or ensuring that your local and remote configurations are consistent.

            By executing `waypoint fmt --workspace [WORKSPACE_NAME]`, you tell Waypoint to format the configuration files based on the specified workspace's settings. It will help you maintain a clean and consistent YAML syntax and structure across all of your configurations within that workspace.
        write: '[AI] The `waypoint fmt --write` command is used in Waypoint, an open-source multi-host configuration management tool, to apply formatted templates and generate configuration files. This command takes the output from a previously defined format definition and applies it to the current configuration, then writes the resulting updated configuration back to the defined file or files. In essence, it allows you to define how your configuration files should look like using templates, and apply those definitions to update the actual files with the correct formatting.'
