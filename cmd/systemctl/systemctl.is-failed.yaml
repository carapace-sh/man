documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `systemctl is-failed` command is used to check if a systemd service has failed based on its current state. When run without any arguments, it returns the status of the default target (usually "multi-user.target"). If you provide the name of a specific service as an argument, it will return whether that service has failed or not. The output is simple: "active", "inactive", "failed", or "unknown" depending on the state of the service.'
