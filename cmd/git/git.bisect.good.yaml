documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `git bisect good` command is used during a Git bisect session to mark a specific commit as "good." This means that the code in this commit does not contain the bug that is being investigated. When running `git bisect good`, you should provide the hash or branch name of the commit you believe to be free of the issue. The Git bisect tool will then update its internal state accordingly, continuing the process of finding the problematic commit by moving toward the bad commits based on this information.'
