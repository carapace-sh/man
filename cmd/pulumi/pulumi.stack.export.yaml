documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `pulumi stack export` command in Pulumi, a cloud infrastructure provisioning and management tool, is used to generate an output file containing the current state of a specified stack as JSON or HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language). This output can be used for various purposes, such as versioning or sharing the current configuration with other team members. The exported file can be easily imported back into Pulumi using the `pulumi stack import` command to restore the previous state.'
    flag:
        show-secrets: |-
            [AI] `pulumi stack export --show-secrets` is a command provided by Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform, to generate an output file containing all the configuration values for the specified stack, including any sensitive data marked as secrets in your Pulumi project's code.

            When you run this command, Pulumi will traverse your deployed stack's resources and collect their current property values. Sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, are encrypted at rest and decrypted on the fly when needed. By using `--show-secrets`, these encrypted secrets will be decrypted and included in the exported file. The output file is typically in JSON format, making it easy to store and manage your infrastructure configuration offline or for use in other parts of your CI/CD pipeline.

            It's important to note that due to security reasons, this command should only be run in a secure environment, such as a trusted internal network, and the output file should be properly protected to prevent unauthorized access.
