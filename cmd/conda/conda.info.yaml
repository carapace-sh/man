    command: '[AI] `conda info` is a command used in Anaconda or Miniconda environments to display various information about the current conda installation. It shows details about the active environment, installed packages, channels, and other settings such as the conda version, build number, and default user profile. This command helps users manage their conda environments by providing essential information for troubleshooting and maintaining their installations.'
    flag:
        all: |-
            [AI] `conda info --all` is a command used in the Anaconda distribution of Python and its packages manager, Conda. This command provides comprehensive information about the current Anaconda environment, including:

            1. Installed channels: The list of Conda channels from which packages are installed.
            2. Environments: A list of all created Conda environments along with their versions and build numbers.
            3. Packages: Detailed information on all installed packages, such as package name, version, build number, and installation path.
            4. Dependencies: Information about dependencies for each installed package, including the resolved dependency versions.
            5. Configuration: System settings and user-defined settings related to Conda.
            6. Systems: Operating system information and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
        base: '[AI] `conda info --base` is a command in Anaconda''s conda package manager that returns information about the current active environment and base environment. The base environment refers to the default environment installed with Anaconda distribution, which typically contains minimal packages required for running conda itself. This command displays details such as the environment name, location, version number, and activated status of both the active environment and base environment.'
        envs: '[AI] `conda info --envs` is a command used in Anaconda and Miniconda environments to display information about all created Conda environments. The output includes each environment''s name, its active status, the base environment from which it was created, and the location of the environment''s root directory on the file system. This command helps users manage their Conda environments and maintain track of installed packages in different environments.'
        help: '[AI] `conda info --help` is a command used in Anaconda or Miniconda environments to display helpful information about the current Conda installation. The "--help" option provides detailed usage information for the "conda info" subcommand, including available options and their functions. It can be used to check the version of Conda installed, the location of the conda environment files, and other relevant details.'
        json: '[AI] `conda info --json` is a command used in Anaconda or Miniconda distribution of Python and R data sciences environments. It generates and prints out detailed JSON formatted information about the current active conda environment, including packages installed, their versions, build numbers, and other metadata. This can be useful for scripting or automated processes to inspect the state of an environment, or for sharing configuration details with others.'
        quiet: '[AI] `conda info --quiet` is a command used in Anaconda or Miniconda distribution of Python and its packages management system, Conda. This command provides a minimal output displaying the currently activated environment, the Conda version, and the location of the Conda installation. The `--quiet` option is used to suppress detailed information from the output for a more concise view.'
        system: '[AI] `conda info --system` is a command used in Anaconda/Miniconda distribution of Python and R data sciences environments. This command displays detailed information about the current Conda system environment including the installed versions of Conda, the default channel priority, and the locations of the Conda installation directories. It provides insights into the configuration and state of the Conda environment setup, helping users troubleshoot issues or understand their current environment settings.'
        unsafe-channels: '[AI] `conda info --unsafe-channels` is a command used in Anaconda/Miniconda environments to display information about the condas (channels) that are enabled with the "unsafe" permission level. These channels may contain packages that have not been reviewed or certified by the Conda Forge community, increasing the potential risk of installing outdated, vulnerable, or malicious software. Users should exercise caution when enabling and using such channels.'
        verbose: '[AI] `conda info --verbose` is a command used in Anaconda or Miniconda environments to display detailed information about the current installation. It lists all active environments, their roots and versions, packages installed, channels they come from, build numbers, and other relevant details. The `--verbose` flag increases the output level to show as much detail as possible.'
