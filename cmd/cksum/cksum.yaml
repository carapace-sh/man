    command: '[AI] The `cksum` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems used to calculate and display the checksum of a file. A checksum is a fixed-size numerical value derived from the data in a file, which can be used to verify its integrity. When you run `cksum` followed by the name of a file, it displays the name of the file along with its size and two checksums: the CKSUMS (adler32) checksum and the classic dotted checksum. The output can be used for comparison with the expected checksum to ensure data integrity.'

            [AI] `cksum` is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems used to calculate and display the checksum of a file. The checksum is a numerical value, usually computed as the sum of the bytes in the file or using more complex algorithms like Adler-32 or CRC-32.

            The `--help` option when used with `cksum`, displays detailed information about how to use the command effectively:

            1. Calculate checksum for files: Run `cksum <filename>`
            2. Display only checksum without file name: Run `cksum -l <filename>`
            3. Compare two files' checksums and display their names if they match: Run `cksum <file1> <file2>`
            4. Read from standard input: Pipe data into `cksum`, e.g., `cat <file> | cksum`
            5. Output in hexadecimal format: Use the option `-h` or `--hex` with any command mentioned above, e.g., `cksum -l --hex <filename>`.
        version: '[AI] The `cksum` is a Linux utility command used to compute and display checksums of files. The `--version` option is used to display the version information of the `cksum` command itself. When you run `cksum --version`, it will output the name of the command, its version number, and sometimes other relevant information such as compilation date or author details. This helps users to identify which version of the command they are using for any necessary compatibility or bug-fixing purposes.'
