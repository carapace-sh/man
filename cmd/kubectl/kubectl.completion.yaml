    command: '[AI] `kubectl completion` is a subcommand used with the Kubernetes `kubectl` tool to generate shell completions for various Kubernetes resources and commands. It enhances the user experience by providing suggestions as you type in your terminal or command-line interface. For example, it can suggest valid resource names, fields, or verbose flags when using `kubectl create`, `kubectl delete`, or other kubectl commands. The generated completions are specific to the user''s shell (e.g., Bash, Zsh, Fish), and they can be easily installed with a few terminal commands.'
