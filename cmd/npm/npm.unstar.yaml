documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `npm unstar` command is used in the Node Package Manager (npm) to remove a star from a GitHub repository linked to an npm package. This action represents unfavoriting or unsubscribing from the package updates in the npm registry. When you run `npm unstar <package-name>`, it removes your personal star from that specific package, but it does not affect other users'' stars or the overall popularity ranking of the package.'
    flag:
        otp: '[AI] `npm unstar --otp` is a command used in npm (Node Package Manager) to unstar a specific repository in your npm account. The `--otp` flag stands for One-Time Password, which is required to authorize the action. When you run this command followed by the GitHub username and repository name, it will remove the star from that repository in your npm profile, indicating that you no longer want to receive notifications about updates to that package.'

This command is used to unfavorite or unstar a specific npm package from your personal npm registry. The `--unicode` option ensures that the package name, which may include Unicode characters, is handled correctly during the command execution.'
