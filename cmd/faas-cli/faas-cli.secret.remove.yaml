documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `faas-cli secret remove` command is used to delete a secret in Faas (Function as a Service) using the FaaS-CLI (Faas Command Line Interface). When you run this command, you specify the name of the secret to be deleted. The Faas-CLI connects to your Faas backend and deletes the specified secret from its storage. This helps in managing secrets used by your functions, allowing you to add, remove or update them as needed.'
    flag:
        gateway: '[AI] The `faas-cli secret remove --gateway` command is used in Faas (Function as a Service) technology to delete a secret from a Faas gateway. The Faas gateway acts as an API to deploy and manage functions as microservices. This command removes a specific secret, which is typically a sensitive piece of information such as an API key or access token, from the Faas gateway configuration. By deleting the secret, you''re revoking its access to the functions under that gateway.'

            [AI] The `faas-cli` (FaaS CLI) is a command-line interface tool for managing functions as a service (FaaS) deployments using FaaS platforms like OpenFaas and Fairwinds. The `faas-cli secret remove --namespace` command is used to delete a specific secret from the given Kubernetes namespace.

            Here's a brief explanation of each part:

            * `faas-cli`: The name of the command-line interface tool for managing FaaS deployments.
            * `secret`: Represents the Kubernetes object that securely stores and manages sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, or SSH keys.
            * `remove`: Indicates the action to perform, which is deleting a secret.
            * `--namespace`: Specifies the Kubernetes namespace where the secret is located, allowing you to target secrets in different namespaces if needed.
        tls-no-verify: '[AI] The `faas-cli secret remove --tls-no-verify` command is used in Faas (Function as a Service) to remove a secret from the Faas registry. The `--tls-no-verify` flag disables SSL certificate verification during the communication between your local machine and the Faas registry. This can be useful if you''re working behind a proxy or firewall that modifies or intercepts SSL/TLS traffic, but it should be used with caution as it can potentially expose your communications to man-in-the-middle attacks.'
        token: '[AI] The `faas-cli` is a command-line interface tool for interacting with FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) platforms, such as OpenFaaS. The `faas-cli secret remove --token` command is used to delete a named secret token from the local configuration file. This means that any function using this token for authentication will no longer be able to access it through the FaaS platform. It''s an essential command to manage secrets security in your development workflow, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed unintentionally.'
