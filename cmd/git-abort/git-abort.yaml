documentation:
    command: '[AI] There is no Git command named "git-abort." Git is a version control system, and it doesn''t have an abort command as part of its default functionality. If you meant to ask about other common Git commands like "git checkout --", "git reset --", or "git revert", each of these commands performs different actions for reversing or canceling changes in Git, but they don''t exactly equate to an "abort" command.'
    flag:
        help: |-
            [AI] `git-abort` is not a Git command with a `--help` option. The closest Git commands that might be confused with `git-abort` are:

            1. `git checkout -- <file>...` or `git reset -- <commit>` to discard changes and restore files from the Git repository, but these don't abort a previous Git command or operation like what your command suggests.
            2. `git reset --abort` was available in Git versions before 1.7.9, but it has been removed due to its potential for data loss and confusion with other Git commands. It allowed users to abort the last commit and discard changes introduced during the commit message editing.
            3. To get help about a Git command or option, use `git help <command>` or `git help <option>`. For example, `git help checkout` or `git help --git-reset` will provide detailed information on those commands.
