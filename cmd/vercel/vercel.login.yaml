    command: '[AI] `vercel login` is a command used in the Vercel CLI (Command Line Interface) for setting up authentication to deploy projects on the Vercel platform. When you run this command, it opens a browser window where you can log in with your existing Git provider account, such as GitHub or Google, or create a new Vercel account. Once you''ve logged in, the CLI generates an access token that is saved locally for secure authentication, enabling you to deploy and manage projects within the Vercel ecosystem.'
