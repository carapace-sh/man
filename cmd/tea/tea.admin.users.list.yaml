documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `tea admin users list` command is used in the TeaDB database management system to retrieve a list of all the registered user accounts under the administrative account. This command helps system administrators to manage and keep track of user access and permissions within their TeaDB environment.'
    flag:
        fields: '[AI] The `tea admin users list --fields` command is used in the Tea DB tool to retrieve a list of admin users and display only specific fields or columns. The `--fields` option allows you to specify which columns you want to see for each user record. This can be useful for getting a focused view of the data, such as just the username and email address for each admin user.'
        limit: '[AI] The `tea admin users list --limit` command is used in the TeaDB database management tool to retrieve a specific number of records from the list of admin users. The `--limit` option sets the maximum number of records to be displayed. For example, `tea admin users list --limit 5` will return the details of the first 5 admin users in the system.'
        login: '[AI] The `tea admin users list --login` command is used in the TeaDB database management tool. It retrieves a list of all TeaDB admin users and their associated login details, which includes the username and hashed password. This command helps administrators to manage and maintain the list of admin users for their TeaDB databases.'
        output: '[AI] The `tea` command with the argument `admin users list --output` is a command used in the TeaDB database management tool. It specifically requests the listing of all administrative user accounts in the TeaDB database. The `--output` option specifies that the output of this command should be presented in a format that can be easily processed by other applications or scripts, such as JSON or CSV.'
        page: '[AI] The `tea admin users list --page` command is used in TeaDB, a MySQL administration tool for Node.js. This specific command lists all available user accounts with pagination. It displays a set of users per page, making the output more manageable for larger installations. Users can navigate through pages using the `--prev` and `--next` flags to view previous or next sets of users, respectively.'
        remote: '[AI] `tea` is a CLI tool for managing Teasource, an open-source GitOps platform for Kubernetes. The command `tea admin users list --remote` retrieves a list of all user accounts configured in a remote Teasource installation. It does not show local users but rather those defined in the given remote Teasource server. This command helps administrators to manage and keep track of user accounts across multiple Teasource installations.'
        repo: '[AI] The `tea admin users list --repo` command is used in the Tectonic (now Docker Enterprise) platform to display a list of Kubernetes RBAC users and their corresponding roles within a specific GitOps repository. This command helps administrators manage access control within their Tectonic environment by allowing them to view and modify the configuration of who has what permissions for each repository.'
