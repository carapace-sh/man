documentation:
    command: '[AI] `powertop` is a Linux power management tool that helps to reduce power consumption by identifying and suggesting power-saving measures for the system. It monitors various system components, such as CPUs, hard drives, and memory usage, and provides real-time recommendations on how to optimize power usage. Users can interactively explore the power consumption details of individual system components or apply predefined power-saving policies. The ultimate goal is to improve energy efficiency and extend battery life in laptops while maintaining optimal system performance.'
    flag:
        auto-tune: '[AI] `powertop --auto-tune` is a command from the Linux power management tool, Powertop. It initiates an automatic power optimization for the system, adjusting various settings and configurations to reduce power consumption. By running `--auto-tune`, Powertop analyzes system behavior, identifies inefficient processes or hardware components, and applies appropriate optimizations. This command can improve battery life on laptops or reduce power usage on desktops, leading to cost savings and reduced environmental impact.'
        calibrate: '[AI] `powertop` is a Linux power saving tool that helps to reduce power consumption by identifying and adjusting power-hungry processes and hardware components. The command `powertop --calibrate` is used to calibrate the power sensor data. Calibration ensures accurate power consumption readings, which in turn helps to optimize power savings more effectively. This process involves making measurements of actual power usage under different load conditions and updating the calibration data accordingly. By running this command periodically or after significant hardware changes, users can ensure their power saving settings remain effective and precise.'
        csv: '[AI] `powertop --csv` is a command-line utility from Linux''s PowerTOP tool, which is used to diagnose and improve power consumption in Linux systems. The `--csv` option causes PowerTOP to output its data in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format, allowing for easier data manipulation with spreadsheet software or further processing through scripts. This information helps users identify hardware components and system settings that consume excessive power, enabling them to optimize power usage and save energy.'
        debug: '[AI] `powertop --debug` is a command-line option used with the PowerTOP software, which is a Linux power-saving utility. This option enables and increases the level of debug information that PowerTOP outputs during its operation. It''s primarily used for troubleshooting and development purposes as the extensive debug output can provide valuable insights into system power consumption behavior and interactions between different components.'
        extech: '[AI] `powertop --output-text-file=<filename> --detail-line-length=<width> --report-type=extech` is a command used in Linux systems to generate detailed power consumption reports for various hardware components. The `--extech` option specifically formats the output according to Extensible Markup Language for Technology Conformance and Use (EXI) standard, which allows efficient transfer of large data sets over low-bandwidth communication channels. This format is useful when analyzing power usage in embedded systems or remote environments where bandwidth is limited.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `powertop` is a Linux utility designed to help improve power efficiency by identifying and suggesting solutions for power-consuming processes or hardware components. The command `powertop --help` provides a brief explanation of how to use the tool. Here's what it covers:

            1. **Usage:** Lists various ways to invoke powertop with different options.
            2. **Options:** Briefly describes each option, such as `--auto-quiesce`, `--detailed-statistics`, or `--html-report`.
            3. **Output formats:** Explains the different output formats supported by powertop like text, JSON, or HTML.
            4. **Examples:** Provides a few usage examples to help users get started with powertop.
        html: '[AI] The `powertop` is a Linux power saving tool, and the command `powertop --html` generates an HTML report of the system''s power consumption analysis. This report includes detailed information on power usage by individual processes, hardware components, and other power-related data. It can be opened in a web browser for easy viewing and interpretation.'
        iteration: '[AI] The `--iteration` option in the PowerTOP tool is used to run the power saving optimization analysis repeatedly, with each iteration providing more refined suggestions for reducing power consumption on Linux systems. It takes an argument specifying the number of iterations to perform. After analyzing system power usage and suggesting improvements in the first iteration, subsequent iterations may reveal additional optimizations based on the previous results. This can lead to increasingly effective power savings over multiple runs.'
        quiet: '[AI] `powertop --quiet` is a command-line option used with the Powertop power optimization tool in Linux. It runs Powertop in silent mode, suppressing all output except for critical messages. This can be useful when integrating Powertop into scripts or automated workflows where detailed output is not required.'
        sample: '[AI] `powertop --sample` is a command-line utility from the Linux PowerTOP toolset designed for analyzing and optimizing power consumption in Linux systems. This specific usage of the command initiates a new data sampling session, where PowerTOP collects data about system components and their power usage characteristics in real time. The collected data is then used by PowerTOP to provide suggestions for power savings, such as disabling unused hardware or adjusting system settings. After the sampling session is completed, users can review the results using other PowerTOP commands, like `report`.'
        time: '[AI] The `powertop --time` command is a Linux utility that measures and reports the power consumption of various system components and processes. It displays the results in a table, sorted by power usage, along with the elapsed time since the last reboot. This information can help identify power-hungry processes or hardware to optimize system power usage and save energy.'
        version: '[AI] `powertop --version` is a command used in Linux systems to display the version information of the Powertop power-saving tool. It provides details about the specific version number, compilation date, and other relevant build-related information to help users identify and manage power consumption issues more effectively.'
        workload: '[AI] `powertop --workload` is a command-line utility from the PowerTOP Linux tool that allows users to analyze and optimize system power consumption. The `--workload` option specifies the workload or usage pattern to be tested for power efficiency. By running a specific workload, PowerTOP can identify processes or system configurations that consume excessive power and provide suggestions on how to improve efficiency and save power. This can help in optimizing laptop batteries'' lifespan, reducing energy costs, or improving overall system performance while conserving resources.'
