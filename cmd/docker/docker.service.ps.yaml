documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker service ps` is a command used in Docker Swarm mode to list the running services along with their replicas, status, and network settings. It provides essential information about the deployed services in your Swarm cluster. The output includes details such as service name, task IDs of running tasks, desired and current state, and port bindings, helping users manage and monitor their Docker applications effectively.'
    flag:
        filter: '[AI] `docker service ps` is a command used to list the running services in a Docker Swarm cluster. The `--filter` option allows you to filter the output based on certain labels or properties. For instance, `--filter=name=<service_name>` will show details of a specific service, while `--filter=status=running` will display only the services with running status. You can combine filters using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `nor`. For example, `--filter="(status=running) and (name!=my_service)"` will show all services except `my_service` with running status.'
        format: '[AI] `docker service ps --format` is a command used with Docker Swarm to list running services and format the output according to user-defined templates. The `--format` option allows specifying an output format string that customizes how the output data is displayed. This can be useful for automating tasks or extracting specific information from the service list. For example, you might use a format like `{{.Name}}: {{.Status}}` to show just the service name and status.'
        no-resolve: '[AI] `docker service ps --no-resolve` is a command used in Docker Swarm mode to list all running services with their replicas, status, and other relevant details. The `--no-resolve` flag prevents the resolution of service names to their tasks or nodes, meaning that the output will only display the service name and not the underlying task or node information. This can be useful when dealing with a large number of services or for scripting purposes where you are primarily interested in the service level details.'
        no-trunc: '[AI] `docker service ps --no-trunc` is a command used in Docker Swarm to list all running services with truncated output by default. The `--no-trunc` flag disables this truncation and displays the full output of each service, including its status, mode, replicas, placement constraints, and other details. This can be useful for getting a comprehensive view of your services when dealing with large numbers or complex configurations.'
        quiet: '[AI] `docker service ps --quiet` is a command used in Docker Swarm to list information about running services in a quiet mode. Quiet mode means that only essential information is displayed, typically in key-value format, without any extra formatting or human-readable output. The output usually includes service name, ID, and status.'
