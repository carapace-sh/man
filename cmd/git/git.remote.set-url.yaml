documentation:
    command: '[AI] `git remote set-url` is a Git command used to update the URL of a remote repository. The basic syntax is: `git remote <name> set-url <new_url>`. Replace `<name>` with the name of the remote (origin, for example), and `<new_url>` with the new URL you want to use. This command modifies the .git/config file in your local repository to store the updated URL for that remote.'
    flag:
        add: '[AI] `git remote set-url --add` is a Git command used to add a new remote repository URL or update an existing one for a specific remote in your local Git repository. The "--add" option appends the new URL to the list of URLs for that remote, allowing you to have multiple URLs for the same remote origin. For example: `git remote set-url --add origin <new_url>`.'
        delete: '[AI] `git remote set-url --delete` is a Git command used to remove the URL of a remote repository that is currently configured in your local Git repository. When you run this command followed by the name of a remote (origin, for example), Git will delete the existing URL associated with that remote. This can be useful when you need to change or update the URL for a remote repository, such as if you''re switching from one hosting service to another.'
        push: '[AI] The `git remote set-url --push` command is used to update the URL configuration for pushing changes to a remote repository in Git. It modifies the URL for the upstream branch of the current repository, allowing you to change the location where you push commits to, such as a new or different remote server. This is particularly useful when working with multiple remotes or when migrating your repository to a new hosting service.'
