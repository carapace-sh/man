description: run tests for a release
group: main
flags:
    --filter*=: 'specify tests by attribute (currently "name") using attribute=value syntax or ''!attribute=value'' to exclude a test (can specify multiple or separate values with commas: name=test1,name=test2)'
    --logs: dump the logs from test pods (this runs after all tests are complete, but before any cleanup)
    --timeout=: time to wait for any individual Kubernetes operation (like Jobs for hooks)
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `helm test` is a Helm command used to run tests defined in the charts'' `values.yaml` or `tests/` directory. It installs and upgrades the chart locally, then runs tests using the specified test runner (e.g., `go-test`, `make test`). The test results are displayed after completion. This command helps ensure the chart functions correctly before being deployed in a production environment.'
    flag:
        filter: '[AI] `helm test` is a command from Helm, the Kubernetes Package Manager, used for testing Helm charts locally before deploying them in production environments. The `--filter` option filters the tests to run based on their names or tags. For example, `helm test --filter unit,integration` would only run unit and integration tests within a chart. This allows developers to focus on specific types of tests during development and debugging.'
        logs: '[AI] `helm test --logs` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager, to run tests defined in a Helm chart''s `values.yaml` or `tests/` directory. The `--logs` flag enables the output of real-time logs from the test execution for better visibility and debugging. It helps developers to monitor test progress, troubleshoot issues, and gain insights into the behavior of their application under test.'
        timeout: '[AI] `helm test` is a command used in Helm, a popular Kubernetes package manager, to run tests defined in the charts'' values.yaml or tests folder. The `--timeout` option sets a time limit for the tests to complete. If the tests exceed this time limit, Helm will consider the tests failed. This can help ensure that tests run efficiently and don''t unnecessarily prolong the release process.'
