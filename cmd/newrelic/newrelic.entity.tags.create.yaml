    command: |-
        [AI] `newrelic entity tags create` is a command used in New Relic, a software performance monitoring tool. This command creates or updates one or more tags for an entity (such as applications, browsers, or hosts) within the New Relic platform. Tags help with organizing and filtering entities for easier management and analysis. The command takes a JSON payload as an argument, containing keys `entityType`, `name`, and `tags` which define the entity type, name, and new or updated tags respectively. For example:

        ```json
        {
          "entityType": "application",
          "name": "exampleApp",
          "tags": {
            "Environment": "Production",
            "Team": "Frontend"
          }
        }
        ```
    flag:
        guid: '[AI] The command `newrelic entity tags create --guid` is used in New Relic to create a new entity tag with the given GUID (Globally Unique Identifier). New Relic Entity Tags help in organizing and filtering entities in the New Relic platform. This command creates or updates an existing tag using the provided GUID and allows you to associate it with one or more entities.'
        tag: '[AI] The `newrelic entity tags create --tag` command is used in New Relic to create a new entity tag with the specified name as an argument after `--tag`. This command allows users to organize and filter their New Relic entities, such as applications or browsers, based on custom tags they define. By creating a new tag, users can easily search for and manage specific groups of entities within the New Relic platform.'
