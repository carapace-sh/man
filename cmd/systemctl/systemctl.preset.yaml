        [AI] The `systemctl preset` command is used in systemd-based Linux distributions to enable or disable a set of units (services, targets, paths, etc.) that are associated with a given preset name. A preset is essentially a collection of unit files that are managed together. For example, you can use the `systemctl preset --list` command to see a list of available presets, such as `default.target`, `graphical.target`, or `multi-user.target`. To enable or disable a preset, you can use the `--enable` or `--disable` option followed by the preset name:

        ```
        sudo systemctl preset --enable <preset-name>
        sudo systemctl preset --disable <preset-name>
        ```

        Enabling a preset will start or enable all the units associated with that preset, while disabling it will stop or disable those units. Note that you may need to use `sudo` to run this command if you're not logged in as the root user.
