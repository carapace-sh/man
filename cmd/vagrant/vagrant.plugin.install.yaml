documentation:
    command: '[AI] `vagrant plugin install` is a Vagrant command used to download and install specified plugins from the Vagrant Plugin directory or from a local path. Plugins extend Vagrant functionality by adding new features, improving performance, or providing better integration with various environments and tools. The installation process includes downloading the plugin, extracting its contents, and making it available for use in Vagrant projects.'
    flag:
        entry-point: '[AI] `vagrant plugin install` is a command used to install Vagrant plugins, which extend the functionality of Vagrant. The `--entry-point` option specifies that you want to install a plugin that provides a custom entry point script for Vagrant''s `vagrant up` command. This means that when you run `vagrant up`, it will first execute the commands defined in the plugin''s entry point script before proceeding with the normal vagrant provisioning process. This can be useful for integrating additional setup tasks or custom workflows into your Vagrant projects.'
        local: '[AI] `vagrant plugin install --local` is a command used in Vagrant, a software provisioning tool for automating the setup and configuration of development environments. This command is used to install a locally-downloaded plugin into Vagrant without adding it to your Vagrantfile or Gemfile. The "--local" option specifies that the plugin file should be installed from a local directory instead of downloading it from RubyGem or another remote source.'
        plugin-clean-sources: '[AI] `vagrant plugin install` is a Vagrant command used to install plugins, which are extensions that add new functionality to Vagrant. The `--plugin-clean-sources` option is used to clean up any unused or outdated plugin sources after installation. In other words, it removes the plugin source directory once the plugin has been installed from a specific source. This helps keep the Vagrant configuration folder neat and reduces potential conflicts between different plugins by ensuring only the required plugin sources are present.'
        plugin-source: |-
            [AI] The `vagrant plugin install` command is used to install Vagrant plugins in your local environment. The `--plugin-source` option specifies where to download the plugin from. It can be set to one of two values:

            1. A local path to a previously downloaded plugin directory.
            2. A URL or remote repository location, such as `hashicorp/vagrant-docker-provider` or `plugins.vagrantup.com`.

            For instance, if you want to install the `vagrant-docker-provider` plugin from the HashiCorp Vagrant plugins repository, you would run:

            ```bash
            $ vagrant plugin install --plugin-source hashicorp/vagrant-docker-provider
            ```

            This command downloads and installs the `vagrant-docker-provider` plugin for you. Using `--plugin-source` with a URL ensures that you get the latest version of the plugin directly from its source.
        plugin-version: |-
            [AI] The command `vagrant plugin install --plugin-version` is used to install a specific version of a Vagrant plugin. Here's a breakdown:

            * `vagrant`: This is the Vagrant command-line interface tool for managing and controlling Vagrant environments.
            * `plugin`: A Vagrant plugin extends the functionality of Vagrant, providing additional features or integrations.
            * `install`: Installs the specified plugin in your local Vagrant configuration.
            * `--plugin-version`: This option allows you to install a specific version of the plugin instead of the latest one. You can provide the plugin name followed by the desired version number, for example: `vagrant plugin install hashicorp/vagrant-hosts --plugin-version 1.2.3`.
        verbose: '[AI] The command `vagrant plugin install --verbose` is used to install a Vagrant plugin with detailed output. The `--verbose` option increases the level of output from Vagrant during the installation process, providing more information about what is happening at each stage of the installation. This can be helpful for troubleshooting or understanding the installation process in detail.'
