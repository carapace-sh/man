documentation:
    command: '[AI] `npm run-script` is a command used in Node.js projects to execute scripts defined in the "scripts" section of the package.json file. It automatically sets up the node environment and runs the specified script. For example, `npm run-test` would run a test script defined in the "scripts" object.'
    flag:
        if-present: '[AI] `npm run-script --if-present` is a command used in Node.js projects managed with npm (Node Package Manager). It executes a named script from package.json files, if they already exist in the project directory or in transitive dependencies. This command does not create new scripts but runs existing ones, making it useful for running common tasks across multiple projects with similar script names.'
        ignore-scripts: |-
            [AI] `npm run-script` is a command used in Node.js projects managed with npm (Node Package Manager). It allows running scripts specified in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file.

            The `--ignore-scripts` flag modifies the behavior of `npm run-script`. Instead of executing all the scripts defined, it only runs the one that is explicitly provided as an argument. All other scripts are ignored. This can be useful when you want to bypass some scripts during development or testing.
        script-shell: '[AI] `npm run-script` is a command used in Node.js projects managed with npm (Node Package Manager). It runs a defined script from the "scripts" section in the package.json file. The `--script-shell` option specifies which shell to use for executing the scripts, allowing flexibility between using the system or an embedded shell like Cygwin, zsh, etc. For example, `npm run-script start:server -- --port 3000` would run the "start:server" script with Node''s built-in REPL environment, while `npm run-script start:server --shell sh -c ''node server.js --port 3000''` would use an external shell to run the command in a Unix-like environment.'
        workspace: '[AI] `npm run-script --workspace` is a command used in Node.js projects managed with npm (Node Package Manager). It executes a defined script from the package.json file of the current or specified workspace (multi-package project). The `--workspace` flag specifies which workspace''s scripts to run. This helps maintain consistency and simplify build processes across multiple packages in an npm workflow.'
        workspaces: |-
            [AI] `npm run-script --workspaces` is a command used in npm (Node Package Manager) to execute a script defined in a package.json file, but specifically for projects that use the workspace feature in npm 5.2.0 and above. With workspaces, you can have multiple packages in one npm project, each with its own package.json file and independent dependencies.

            The `--workspaces` option tells npm to look for scripts not just in the current package's package.json file but also in the package.json files of all workspaces within the same npm tree. This way, you can define and run scripts across multiple packages in a monorepo or multipeg repository setup.
