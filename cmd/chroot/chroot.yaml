documentation:
    command: '[AI] `chroot` (Change Root) is a Linux utility that allows creating a new root directory for a process and its descendants, effectively isolating it from the rest of the system. This is often used in containerized environments or for setting up chroots for secure testing or software installation. The command takes the new root directory as an argument and changes the root directory for the process running it, restricting its access to only the files and directories within that directory tree.'
    flag:
        groups: '[AI] `chroot` is a Linux command used to change the root directory of the current running process and its sub-processes, confining them to a specific path. The `--groups` option modifies the supplementary groups for the new root environment. It takes a list of group IDs or group names as an argument. By using this option, the specified groups are added to the new root environment, allowing processes running inside the chroot jail to have access to resources owned by those groups. This can enhance security by limiting the capabilities of processes within the jailed environment.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `chroot` is a Linux utility used to change the root directory of the running process and its sub-processes, creating an isolated environment. This can be useful for securing or testing systems. Here's a brief explanation of the `--help` option:

            When you run `chroot --help`, it will display detailed information about the `chroot` command and its available options. It provides a usage summary, description, and a list of possible options. Some common options include:

            - `-h`, `--help`: Display this help text and exit.
            - `--source <path>`: Specify the directory to be made the new root for the child process.
            - `--target <path>`: The directory in the new root where the initial process will be executed.
            - `--user <name|UID>`: Change the user or UID for the new environment.
            - `--group <name|GID>`: Change the group or GID for the new environment.

            This information should give you a good starting point when working with the `chroot` command. For more in-depth details, refer to the man page or further documentation.
        skip-chdir: |-
            [AI] The `chroot` command with the option `--skip-chdir` changes the root directory of the current process and its descendants but keeps the working directory (represented by the environment variable $PWD) unchanged. This means that any new processes spawned from the chrooted process will also begin in the chroot jail, while maintaining their previous working directory outside of it.

            In simpler terms, `chroot --skip-chdir` sets a new root directory for the current process and its children, while keeping the current working directory unchanged.
        userspec: '[AI] `chroot` is a Linux utility that changes the root directory of the running system for a process and its children. The `--userspec` option modifies the effective user and group IDs inside the chroot environment. This allows creating isolated environments where specific users or groups can be emulated, enhancing the security and control over applications. By setting both the user and group IDs with this option, the system enforces these restrictions for the processes within the chroot jail.'
        version: '[AI] `chroot` is a Linux utility used to change the root directory of a running process and its sub-processes, confining them to a specified directory tree. The `--version` option is used to display the version information of the chroot command itself. When you run `chroot --version`, it will output the version number, compilation timestamp, and other build-related information of the chroot utility installed on your system.'
