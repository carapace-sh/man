documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `consul config read` command is used in Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool to retrieve the current configuration settings stored in a Consul server. It returns the value of a specific key or all keys in the hierarchy if no key is provided, as a JSON object. This information can be helpful for understanding or modifying the runtime configuration of applications that are registered with Consul.'
    flag:
        ca-file: '[AI] `consul config read --ca-file` is a command used with Consul, an open-source tool for service discovery, configuration, and orchestration. This specific command reads the configured values from a Consul server while providing a CA file to verify the SSL certificate of the consul agent or server being connected to. The `--ca-file` option specifies the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) file used for the SSL verification, ensuring secure communication with the Consul cluster.'
        ca-path: |-
            [AI] `consul config read --ca-path` is a command used with Hashicorp's Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. This command reads the contents of a specific configuration file, but with an emphasis on the `--ca-path` option.

            The `--ca-path` flag specifies the location of a directory containing trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates. Consul uses these CA certificates to verify the authenticity of encrypted communications and securely retrieve configuration data from other Consul servers or services.

            This command ensures that Consul connects only to trusted sources, maintaining security within your service discovery and configuration management infrastructure.
        client-cert: '[AI] `consul config read --client-cert` is a command used with Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. This command reads a specific configuration entry from Consul, requiring authentication using a client certificate. The certificate is used to authenticate the client making the request, ensuring secure access to sensitive configuration data stored in Consul.'
        client-key: '[AI] `consul config read` is a command from Hashicorp''s Consul service, which is used to retrieve configuration data from Consul. The `--client-key` flag is an authentication token that identifies the client making the request. It ensures that only authorized clients can access sensitive configuration information stored in Consul.'
        datacenter: '[AI] `consul config read --datacenter` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, a service discovery and configuration management tool. This command reads the configuration data from Consul''s datacenter-wide configuration store. The `--datacenter` flag specifies that the configuration data being retrieved belongs to the entire datacenter, rather than a specific agent or node within it. This can be useful when you need to access global configurations or settings that apply across your entire Consul deployment.'
        http-addr: '[AI] The `consul config read --http-addr` command is used in Consul, a distributed configuration and service discovery tool, to retrieve the current value of the HTTP address configuration setting. This command is typically run from the Consul CLI (Command Line Interface) and returns the IP address and port number where Consul''s HTTP interface is listening for requests. The flag `--http-addr` specifies that this particular configuration value should be read, providing valuable information to users looking to connect to or communicate with their running Consul instance.'
        kind: '[AI] `consul config read --kind` is a command used in Hashicorp Consul, a distributed configuration management and service discovery tool. This specific command is used to retrieve the raw configuration data of a particular service or key from Consul''s configuration store. The `--kind` flag specifies the type of resource for which the configuration data will be retrieved. For example, `--kind service` would return the configuration data for a specific service, while `--kind key` would return the configuration data for a particular key-value pair.'
        name: '[AI] `consul config read` is a command from Hashicorp''s Consul configuration management tool. The `--name` flag is used to specify the name of a particular configuration item within Consul. This command retrieves the value of that specific configuration item as output. For example, if you have a key-value pair named "DB_USER" in your Consul configuration store, you can use `consul config read --name DB_USER` to retrieve its current value.'
        namespace: '[AI] `consul config read` is a command from the Consul configuration management tool. The `--namespace` option is used to specify a particular namespace when reading configuration data. With this option, you can retrieve configuration data for a specific namespace in a Consul cluster. For example, if you have multiple applications using Consul for configuration, you can keep each application''s settings separate by using different namespaces. In essence, `consul config read --namespace <namespace>` retrieves the configuration data for the specified namespace from the Consul server.'
        stale: '[AI] The `consul config read --stale` command is used in Consul, a Connect and configure service discovery tool, to retrieve the current configuration data from the server without waiting for a consistent response. The `--stale` flag allows the return of potentially stale or inconsistent data, which may be useful in certain situations where real-time data isn''t required and latency is a concern. This can help improve performance and reduce network traffic.'
        tls-server-name: '[AI] The `consul config read --tls-server-name` command is used with Hashicorp''s Consul service discovery and configuration management tool. This specific command is for reading configuration data from a Consul server using TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption, and specifying the server name as part of the TLS connection. The `--tls-server-name` option is used to provide the DNS label or IP address of the Consul server that you want to connect to securely over TLS. This helps ensure data security by encrypting communication between the client and server, and providing an additional layer of verification through the use of server certificates.'
        token: '[AI] `consul config read` is a command used in Hashicorp''s Consul service to retrieve the current configuration of an agent or client. The `--token` option is used to authenticate the request with a valid ACL token. This token grants permission to read the configuration data, ensuring only authorized users can access and modify sensitive information.'
        token-file: '[AI] `consul config read` is a command used in the Consul configuration management tool. The `--token-file` option specifies a file containing an ACL token for authentication when reading sensitive configuration data from Consul''s Key-Value store. This helps ensure that only authorized users can access the configuration information.'
