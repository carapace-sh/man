    command: '[AI] The `terramate script list` command is used within Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, to display a list of all the Terraform scripts (also known as configuration files) that are present in the current working directory and its subdirectories. It searches for files with the `.tf`, `.hcl`, or `.tfvars` extensions. The output is typically a list of file paths, allowing users to easily identify and manage their Terraform scripts.'
