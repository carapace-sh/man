documentation:
    command: '[AI] `lsusb` is a Linux command used to list information about USB devices connected to the system. It stands for "list USB buses." The command scans the USB bus and displays detailed information such as device vendor ID, product ID, device name, and bus number. It provides useful information when troubleshooting or configuring USB devices.'
    flag:
        D: '[AI] `lsusb -D` is a command used in Linux systems to display detailed information about a specific USB device, identified by its Bus and Device number. The `-D` option stands for "detailed description" and when used with `lsusb`, it outputs USB device tree data that includes the device''s descriptors such as manufacturer name, product ID, serial number, and more. This command is often utilized during system troubleshooting or hardware identification tasks.'
        d: '[AI] `lsusb -d` is a command used in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems to list detailed information about USB devices connected to the system. The `-d` option specifies that only the device descriptor part of the output should be displayed, which includes details such as device vendor ID, product ID, device class, subclass, protocol, and interface number. This command is commonly used for identifying and troubleshooting issues with USB devices.'
        help: '[AI] `lsusb --help` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to list information about USB devices connected to the system. The `--help` option displays detailed usage information for the `lsusb` command, including available options and their meanings. It provides a quick reference guide on how to use the command effectively to view USB device bus and device tree information, including device descriptor data such as manufacturer, product ID, and serial number.'
        s: '[AI] `lsusb -s` is a command used in Linux to list detailed information about a specific USB device by its bus and device number. The `lsusb` command itself lists all USB devices connected to the system, but adding the `-s` option followed by the bus and device number (in the format `<bus>.<device>`) allows for a more in-depth view of that particular device''s properties, such as its vendor ID, product ID, device descriptor, and configuration descriptors.'
        tree: '[AI] `lsusb --tree` is a command used in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems to list the USB bus hierarchy and the devices connected to it in a tree format. It provides detailed information about USB devices, including their vendor ID, product ID, device class, subclass, protocol, and parent devices in the hierarchy. This can be useful for debugging USB issues, identifying hardware, or examining the USB device structure for software development purposes. The output is displayed as a tree diagram where each node represents a USB device with its corresponding details.'
        verbose: '[AI] `lsusb --verbose` is a command used in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems to list detailed information about USB devices connected to the system. The `--verbose` option increases the amount of output provided, displaying more specific and technical details than the default `lsusb` command. This includes device descriptor data, configuration descriptor data, and interface descriptor data for each connected USB device. These descriptors contain information such as device vendor ID, product ID, revision number, number of interfaces, interface classes, and interface subclasses. The output is intended for use by system administrators and developers to identify and troubleshoot specific USB devices.'
        version: '[AI] `lsusb` is a command-line utility available in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems for listing USB (Universal Serial Bus) buses, devices connected to them, and their respective vendors, products, and serial numbers. The `--version` option is used to display the version information of the `lsusb` command itself, not the USB devices. It helps users to check which version of the utility is being used for troubleshooting or compatibility purposes.'
