    command: '[AI] The `adb mdns check` command is used with Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to query the Multicast DNS (mDNS) daemon status on an Android device. mDNS allows devices to discover and communicate with each other using multicast DNS, without requiring centralized servers or configurations. By running `adb mdns check`, you can verify whether the mDNS service is enabled or disabled on the connected Android device.'
