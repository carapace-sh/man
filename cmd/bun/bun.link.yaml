documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `bun link` command is used in BUNDLE, a popular Node.js package manager. It''s used to create and update symbolic links (also known as soft links) for specific dependencies listed in a project''s `Bundlerfile`. These links help manage the consistency of installed versions across multiple projects that share common dependencies. When you run `bun link` in your terminal, followed by the path to the target package, it installs the dependency as a link rather than a regular installation, meaning that the actual packages are not downloaded and stored locally but are linked to the original source location instead. This can save disk space and reduce the overall size of your project''s dependencies.'
