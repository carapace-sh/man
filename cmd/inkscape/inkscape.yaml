documentation:
    command: '[AI] Inkscape is a free and open-source vector graphics editor. It allows users to create and edit scalable vector graphics (SVG) with capabilities such as drawing tools, text handling, complex path editing, and advanced markup editing. Inkscape''s features include a flexible drawing engine, layers, various filers and effects, extensions, and a large user community that contributes to its library of symbols, clipart, and templates. It supports importing and exporting various file formats, making it a versatile tool for creating logos, illustrations, and diagrams.'
    flag:
        action-list: '[AI] `--action-list` is a command-line argument for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option loads an external action list file containing a series of actions and their corresponding keybindings or other triggers. Action lists can be used to customize the user interface by creating shortcuts for complex tasks or sequences of commands. They are stored in plain text files with the `.IAL` extension, and can be created and edited using text editors or Inkscape''s built-in extension mechanism. Using the `--action-list` argument allows users to apply specific action lists during startup or when opening certain documents.'
        actions: '[AI] `--actions` is a command-line option in Inkscape, a popular open-source vector graphics editor. This option allows users to execute a list of actions or scripts written in the Inkscape Extensible Markup Language (XSLT) or Extensions. The scripts can automate various tasks within Inkscape such as creating complex shapes, modifying objects, applying filters, and more. Using `--actions` is particularly useful for batch processing multiple files with the same actions or integrating Inkscape into larger workflows.'
        batch-process: '[AI] `inkscape --batch-process` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option enables the execution of Inkscape in batch mode, allowing users to process multiple files or apply specific actions to selected documents without user interaction. To use it, prepare an .ini file with a list of files or commands to be processed and their respective options, then run the command: `inkscape --batch-process=path_to_config_file.ini`. This will automatically open, process, and save each document according to the instructions provided in the .ini file.'
        class: '[AI] `--class` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option is used to specify a default class for newly created objects or shapes within an Inkscape document. A class is essentially a named set of properties that can be applied to objects in order to facilitate easier organization and manipulation of complex designs. By using `--class` when creating new documents or importing files, you ensure all new objects will automatically inherit the specified class, making it easier to apply consistent styles across your project.'
        convert-dpi-method: |-
            [AI] The `--convert-dpi` option in Inkscape is used to convert the DPI (dots per inch) resolution of an SVG file. The `--method` parameter specifies how this conversion should be performed:

            1. "squish": This method preserves the existing size of the image but changes the DPI accordingly. For example, if you want to increase the DPI from 72 to 300 while maintaining the same size, the image will appear smaller on screen or in print.

            2. "resize": In this method, both the size and DPI are adjusted proportionally, keeping the aspect ratio of the image unchanged. This method is useful when you want to increase (or decrease) the size of an image while maintaining its original resolution.

            For example: `inkscape --convert-dpi=300 inkscape_file.svg --method=squish` will convert the DPI of "inkscape_file.svg" from its current value to 300, while maintaining its size, resulting in smaller dimensions on screen or paper.

            Or, `inkscape --convert-dpi=2x2inch inkscape_file.svg --method=resize` will convert the DPI of "inkscape_file.svg" to 150 (for a 2 inch by 2 inch print area at 300 dpi), and resize the image proportionally to maintain its aspect ratio, resulting in larger dimensions on screen or paper.
        dbus-listen: |-
            [AI] `inkscape --dbus-listen` is a command-line argument used with Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This argument enables Inkscape to listen on the system message bus for DBUS (Desktop Bus) signals.

            DBUS is a messaging system used by many desktop applications to communicate with each other and with the operating system. By listening on the DBUS, Inkscape can respond to events from other applications or receive notifications that can be used to integrate more seamlessly into the desktop environment.

            For example, this argument might be useful for creating extensions or scripts that require real-time interaction with other applications or the desktop environment as a whole. It's important to note that using this command might expose additional security risks, so it should only be used when necessary and with proper consideration given to potential vulnerabilities.
        dbus-name: '[AI] `inkscape --dbus-name` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. The option sets the D-Bus (Desktop Bus) name that Inkscape uses to communicate with other applications or services on a system using the D-BUS messaging system. Setting this option allows for better integration and interaction between Inkscape and other applications using D-BUS signals and methods.'
        display: '[AI] `inkscape --display` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option is used to specify which X window manager root window or screen Inkscape should open on. It takes an argument in the format of a window ID or display name, such as `:0.0` for the primary display or `0x12345678` for a specific window. By default, Inkscape opens on the current display and session. This option is useful when working with multiple displays or when running Inkscape in a remote desktop or virtualization environment.'
        export-area: '[AI] The `--export-area` option in Inkscape is used to specify a custom export area when saving or rendering an image. Instead of exporting the entire Inkscape document, this command exports only the specified rectangle or path, defined by its coordinates and dimensions. This can be useful for extracting specific parts of complex drawings without having to manually crop the resulting image in an external editor.'
        export-area-drawing: '[AI] `inkscape --export-area-drawing` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option is used to export only a specific area of an Inkscape document as a bitmap or vector graphic file. The exported area is defined by the drawing or selection enclosed within the `--export-area-x` and `--export-area-y` parameters (specifying the x and y coordinates, respectively) and the `--export-area-width` and `--export-area-height` parameters (specifying the width and height of the export area). The resulting file does not include the entire document but only the defined area. This can save time and resources when dealing with large or complex files.'
        export-area-page: '[AI] The `--export-area-page` option in Inkscape is used to export only a specific area of an Inkscape document as a raster image or vector file, instead of the entire page. This can be useful for exporting specific objects or parts of objects without including the background or other unrelated content. The option takes the format `--export-area=-x1,y1,width,height` where (x1, y1) is the coordinate of the top-left corner and width and height define the size of the export area.'
        export-area-snap: |-
            [AI] `--export-area-snap` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option determines how Inkscape aligns the export area with the page boundaries during the SVG or raster image export process.

            When using `--export-area-snap`, Inkscape automatically snaps the export area to the nearest grid point or page boundary, ensuring that the entire content of the export area is included in the output image. This can be useful when exporting designs with precise alignment requirements. If this option is not used, the exported area will be positioned based on its absolute coordinates in the Inkscape document, regardless of its position relative to the page boundaries.
        export-background: '[AI] `inkscape --export-background` is a command-line option used with Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option instructs Inkscape to export an image with a transparent background instead of the default background defined in the SVG document. This can be useful when you want to place the vector graphic onto a different background in external image editing software or on a website.'
        export-background-opacity: '[AI] The `--export-background-opacity` option in Inkscape is used to control the opacity level of the background layers when exporting an SVG image as a raster graphic format (such as PNG or JPG). By default, Inkscape exports backgrounds with full opacity. However, using this option allows you to specify a transparency value between 0 and 1, where 0 is completely transparent and 1 is fully opaque. This can be useful when exporting complex compositions where the background layers need to be partially or completely transparent in the raster output.'
        export-dpi: '[AI] The `--export-dpi` option in Inkscape is used to specify the target Dots Per Inch (DPI) when exporting an image from the vector graphics editor. DPI refers to the resolution of an image, i.e., how many pixels are present in one inch of the image. By setting `--export-dpi`, users can control the resulting image''s output resolution, which can be essential for printing or preparing designs for digital media where resolution matters.'
        export-filename: '[AI] `inkscape --export-filename` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option sets the filename for the exported graphic when using the `--export` or `--save` commands. The flag expects a string argument specifying the desired output file name. For example, `inkscape document.ink --export-filename=output.png` exports the given Inkscape document as a PNG image with the filename "output.png".'
        export-height: '[AI] `inkscape --export-height` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. It controls the height dimension of the exported image or document, specifying how many pixels or other units (e.g., inches or centimeters) should be included in the vertical direction during the export process.'
        export-id: '[AI] `inkscape --export-id` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a vector graphics editor. This option generates unique IDs for each exported object or page during the export process. By default, Inkscape does not assign such IDs. The `--export-id` option ensures that each object or page in the exported SVG file is given a distinct ID, making it easier to refer to specific elements when working with the code.'
        export-id-only: '[AI] The `--export-id-only` option in Inkscape is used to export only the object IDs from an SVG file, without any graphical data or styling information. This can be useful for scripting and automation tasks where you need to access or manipulate the IDs of specific objects within an SVG document.'
        export-ignore-filters: '[AI] `--export-ignore-filters` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option instructs Inkscribe to ignore exporting filter effects, such as drop shadows, blurs, and other post-processing filters applied to objects in the SVG file during export. The resulting output will only include the shapes, paths, and text information from the original document, without the filtered effects.'
        export-latex: '[AI] `inkscape --export-latex` is a command used in Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This specific command exports an Inkscape project as LaTeX code. The generated LaTeX files can be further processed using a LaTeX compiler to produce high-quality vector graphics, typically for use in documents or presentations. This method ensures consistent scaling and resolution when embedding the graphics into other projects.'
        export-margin: '[AI] `--export-margin` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a vector graphics editor. It sets custom export margins for the output image when using the `--export` or `--export-area` commands to save or export an SVG file. The option takes two values in pixels: the left and right margin. For example, `--export-margin 50px 10px` would set a 50px left margin and a 10px right margin for the output image. The purpose is to control the area of the SVG canvas that gets exported, allowing for adjustments to prevent important content from getting accidentally trimmed during export.'
        export-overwrite: '[AI] The `--export-overwrite` option in Inkscape is used when exporting an SVG file using the command line interface. It allows you to overwrite an existing file with the new exported data without asking for confirmation. This can be useful if you want to automate the export process and don''t need the interruption of a confirmation prompt each time.'
        export-pdf-version: '[AI] The `--export-pdf-version` option in Inkscape is used to specify the version of PDF output when exporting an Inkscape document to PDF format. The default value is "1.7", which corresponds to the latest ISO standard for PDF files (PDF 2.0). However, you can use this option to export to earlier versions such as "1.6" or "1.5" if necessary. Using a specific version may be important when sharing or printing your document, as some software or devices only support older versions of PDF.'
        export-plain-svg: '[AI] `inkscape --export-plain-SVG` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option instructs Inkscape to export an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file in its plain text format instead of the standard XML-based structure. The plain SVG format preserves the raw data of the graphic''s paths, colors, and other properties, making it more suitable for certain applications or scripts that need direct access to the vector data.'
        export-ps-level: |-
            [AI] `inkscape --export-ps-level` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option is used to export an Inkscape document as PostScript (.ps) files with different levels of complexity.

            The `--export-ps-level` option accepts an integer value ranging from 0 to 3. Each level corresponds to the amount of detail and complexity in the exported PostScript file:

            * Level 0: Essentially a bitmap representation, useful for simple diagrams or images that can be printed with minimal processing.
            * Level 1: Basic PostScript output, containing vectors and text but with limited support for complex effects and gradients.
            * Level 2: Advanced PostScript output, suitable for complex documents and supporting more advanced features like strokes, fills, and paths.
            * Level 3: The most comprehensive PostScript export, including all the features supported by Inkscape, such as masks, clones, and extended Markup Language (XML).

            The choice of level depends on your specific use case; higher levels offer better quality but may require more resources for rendering and processing.
        export-text-to-path: '[AI] `inkscape --export-text-to-path` is a command-line option in Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option converts text objects into path objects. When you export or save the SVG file using this flag, the text elements are transformed into complex paths based on their glyph outlines. This results in a simpler file structure and allows for easier manipulation of text as curves and shapes rather than individual text elements. It''s beneficial for creating scalable graphics, animations, or when sharing files with other vector editors or raster graphics programs.'
        export-type: '[AI] The `--export-type` option in Inkscape is used to specify the desired output format when exporting an SVG graphic. This option takes a string argument representing the file format such as "PNG", "PDF", "JPEG", or "EPS" among others, which determines how the data will be converted and saved upon export.'
        export-use-hints: '[AI] The `--export-use-hints` option in Inkscape is used when exporting vector graphics to raster image formats like PNG or JPG. It instructs Inkscape to honor color and alpha channel hints from the original SVG document, ensuring that any transparency or color information is accurately represented in the exported raster image. This can be particularly important for complex designs with multiple layers and blending modes, as it helps maintain visual fidelity between the vector source and the raster output.'
        export-width: '[AI] The `--export-width` option in Inkscape is used to specify an exact width for an exported image or SVG file while keeping its aspect ratio intact. This means that only the specified width will be adjusted during the export process, maintaining the original height-to-width proportion. By using this command along with other export options like `--export-path`, `--type` and `--filename`, you can create scaled down versions of your Inkscape designs while preserving their aspect ratio.'
        g-fatal-warnings: '[AI] The `--g-fatal-errors` or `--g-fatal-warnings` option is a command-line argument for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This argument tells Inkscape to treat warnings as errors and stop the execution of the command with an error code when encountering a warning message. By default, Inkscape will display warning messages but continue executing commands despite them. Using this option can help ensure that only error-free commands are run and improve the overall reliability of scripts or automated workflows that use Inkscape.'
        gapplication-service: '[AI] `inkscape --gapplication-service` is a command used to start Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor, in service mode. In this mode, Inkscape runs as a background application and provides its functionality to other applications through the GApplicationInterface.

It returns the width of the first selected object or the whole page if no objects are selected, as a numeric value in user-defined units (default is pixels). For example, `inkscape document.svg --query-width` will output the document''s width.'
        query-x: '[AI] `inkscape --query-x` is a command-line option for Inkscape vector graphics editor. It allows users to execute Inkscape queries, which are simple expressions that can retrieve information about document properties or node attributes. The option `--query-x` followed by a valid query expression is used to evaluate and display the result of the query as output. For example, `inkscape --query-x="width={documentWidth} height={documentHeight}" myfile.svg` would display the width and height of an Inkscape document named "myfile.svg" when executed in a terminal or command prompt.'
        query-y: '[AI] The command `inkscape --query-y` is a command-line utility for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. It is used to execute queries against an Inkscape document''s internal data model, returning specific information as output. The option `--query-y` specifically instructs Inkscape to only return the Y coordinates of selected objects within the given document. This can be useful for scripting or automation tasks where access to an object''s position is required.'
        select: '[AI] `inkscape --select` is a command-line argument for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This argument is used to select specific objects or elements within an Inkscape document without opening the graphical user interface (GUI). When you run Inkscape with this option followed by a list of object paths or names, it will apply actions only to those selected objects, such as applying transformations, modifying properties, or deleting them. This can be useful for automating tasks or scripting workflows in Inkscape.'
        shell: '[AI] `inkscape --shell` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option enables the use of Inkscape''s scripting interface through an external application or shell script. By invoking Inkscape with this flag, you can interact with the program programmatically and perform tasks such as creating, editing, or modifying SVG files using scripts written in languages like Python, Scheme, or JavaScript. This feature is particularly useful for automating repetitive tasks, generating complex graphics, or integrating Inkscape into other workflows.'
        system-data-directory: '[AI] The `--system-data-directory` option in Inkscape is used to specify the system-wide data directory for Inkscape. This is where Inkscape looks for shared resources such as default user interface icons, fonts, and other system-wide assets. By default, Inkscape sets this directory based on the system''s `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` environment variable. If you need to set or override this directory, you can use the `--system-data-directory` option followed by the path to the desired data directory when starting Inkscape from the command line.'
        user-data-directory: '[AI] `--user-data-directory` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option specifies the directory where Inkscape stores user-specific data such as custom extensions, custom styles, and saved files. By default, this directory is located in `~/.config/inkscape/` on Unix-based systems and in `%APPDATA%\Inkscape` on Windows. Using `--user-data-directory` allows users to set a different location for their user data if needed.'
        vacuum-defs: '[AI] `inkscape --vacuum-defs` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option triggers the defs vacuuming process. Defs vacuuming is an optimization technique that consolidates and simplifies shared objects (symbols, marks, styles, etc.) defined in the document into a single top-level group named "_defs". By doing so, it reduces the overall complexity of the document, improves rendering performance, and makes file size smaller.'
        verb: '[AI] `inkscape --verb` is a command-line usage of Inkscape vector graphics editor, where `--verb` is an option to specify a particular action or command for Inkscape to execute when it''s run. Instead of opening the graphical user interface, this command runs Inkscape in the background, executing the specified verb directly without displaying the interface. For instance, you might use something like `inkscape --verb="ExportCoherentBitMaps=filename.png;Quit"` to export an SVG file as a PNG image and then quit Inkscape from the command line. The exact verb used depends on the specific task you want Inkscape to perform.'
        verb-list: '[AI] `--verb-list` is a command-line option for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option generates a list of available Inkscape commands and their corresponding verb names in the terminal or console. It can be useful for scripting automation tasks or for reference purposes to understand what actions can be performed with Inkscape''s command line interface. For example, you could use it to write a custom bash script that uses Inkscape to create or modify vector graphics. When you run `inkscape --verb-list` in the terminal, Inkscape will output a detailed list of all available commands and their corresponding verb names.'
        version: '[AI] `inkscape --version` is a command used in the Inkscape vector graphics editor to display the current version of the software. When executed in a terminal or command prompt, it returns output showing the version number and build information, such as the compile date and operating system. This helps users ensure they have the latest updates or check the compatibility of their files with different versions.'
        with-gui: '[AI] `inkscape --with-gui` is a command-line argument used with Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. This option ensures that Inkscape starts with its graphical user interface (GUI) enabled. Without the GUI, Inkscape can still be run in a text-based environment or headless mode for automation and scripting purposes. However, for regular use, starting Inkscape with `--with-gui` enables the familiar interface for creating and editing vector graphics.'
