    command: '[AI] The `newrelic nerdstorage collection get` command is used to retrieve data from New Relic''s Nerdgraph query language storage (NerdStorage) using the New Relic CLI (Command Line Interface). This command allows you to specify a collection name and any filters or parameters required to fetch the desired data. The output will be in JSON format, which can be further processed for analysis and reporting purposes.'
    flag:
        collection: |-
            [AI] The `newrelic nerdstorage collection get` command is used to retrieve data from New Relic's NerdGraph API, specifically from a collection stored in NerdStorage. NerdStorage is a flexible and powerful data store where you can collect, store, and analyze custom application data using New Relic's query language, GraphQL.

            The `get` command retrieves the specified collection, which can contain various types of data such as events, metrics, and errors. To identify the collection uniquely, a collection ID or name must be provided as an argument to the command.

            For example, if you have a collection named "MyCustomCollection" with ID `abc123`, you would use:
            ```
            newrelic nerdstorage collection get MyCustomCollection
            newrelic nerdstorage collection get abc123
            ```
            The response will contain the data stored in the specified collection, allowing you to analyze and process it further.
        entityGuid: '[AI] The command `newrelic nerdstorage collection get --entityGuid` is used in New Relic''s Nerdgraph Query Language to retrieve specific data from New Relic''s NerdStorage, which is a queryable and durable data store. The `get` keyword specifies the action, while `--entityGuid` is a filter parameter that restricts the results to only those related to a specific entity Guid (a unique identifier for an application or other instrumented resource). This command allows users to retrieve targeted data efficiently and effectively.'
        packageId: |-
            [AI] The `newrelic redis nanomsgget` command with the specific option `--packageId` is a part of New Relic's NerdStats API, which allows querying and retrieving performance data from New Relic's background agents or infrastructure.

            More specifically, this command is designed to retrieve a collection of NerdStats data for a given Redis package with the provided `packageId`. The data retrieved can include various metrics such as latency, throughput, errors, and other Redis-related performance statistics. This information can be used for monitoring, troubleshooting, and analyzing Redis performance within your application or infrastructure.
        scope: |-
            [AI] The `newrelic nerdstorage collection get --scope` command is used in New Relic's Nerdgraph Query Language (NQL) to retrieve data from New Relic's NerdStorage data store.

            The specific format of the command is as follows:

            * `nerdstorage`: Indicates that you are using the NerdStorage data store.
            * `collection get`: Specifies that you want to retrieve a specific collection of data.
            * `--scope`: Defines the scope or filter for the query, which can be based on various attributes such as application name, environment, date range, etc.

            For example, `nerdstorage collection get --scope appName=myapp env=production` would retrieve all data from the specified collection that matches the conditions of having an application name equal to "myapp" and being in the production environment.
