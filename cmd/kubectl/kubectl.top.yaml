documentation:
    command: '[AI] `kubectl top` is not a native Kubernetes command. There might be third-party tools with this name that provide real-time resource usage statistics for Kubernetes clusters, but there''s no official `kubectl top` command from the Kubernetes project. To get resource usage information, you can use commands like `kubectl describe`, `kubectl top nodes`, or `kubectl top pods`. These commands provide information about the resource usage of nodes or specific pods in your cluster.'
