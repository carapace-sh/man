documentation:
    command: |-
        [AI] `git worktree repair` is a Git command used to fix issues with detached worktrees. A detached worktree occurs when a worktree is not associated with a branch, allowing direct manipulation of files without the context of a branch. However, this can lead to inconsistencies if changes made in the worktree conflict with changes in the main repository.

        `git worktree repair` attempts to resolve these conflicts by fetching the latest state of the branches associated with each worktree and merging any local changes back into them. If conflicts arise during the merge process, they need to be manually resolved using standard Git tools like `git mergetool`. The command does not delete or modify any files in the worktrees unless explicitly instructed via additional options.
