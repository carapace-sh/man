name: click
description: Send a click, that is a mousedown followed by mouseup for the given button
flags:
    --clearmodifiers: Clear modifiers before clicking
    --delay=: Specify how long, in milliseconds, to delay between clicks
    --repeat=: Specify how many times to click
    --window=: Specify a window to send a click to
documentation:
    command: '[AI] `xdotool click` is a command-line tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical user interface (GUI). The `click` subcommand specifically simulates mouse button clicks at specified coordinates or on specific windows. When used without further options, it performs a left button click. This can be useful for automating GUI interactions, such as launching applications or performing repetitive tasks.'
    flag:
        clearmodifiers: '[AI] `xdotool click --clearmodifiers` is a command used in the Linux graphical user interface automation tool, xdotool. This specific command simulates a mouse click event without any modifier keys (such as Shift, Control, or Alt) pressed. The "--clearmodifiers" option ensures that no modifier keys are included with the click event.'
        delay: '[AI] The `xdotool` command is a powerful tool for automating and interacting with the X Window System graphical user interface (GUI) from the command line. The `click` subcommand is used to simulate mouse clicks. The option `--delay MS` sets a delay in milliseconds between actions, such as clicks or keypresses. For example, `xdotool click --delay 1000 <window_id>` will simulate a left mouse button click after a one-second delay on the specified window. This can be useful for introducing pauses between automated interactions with the GUI.'
        repeat: '[AI] `xdotool click --repeat` is a command-line tool for interacting with the X Window System graphical environment. The `click` action simulates mouse clicks, while `--repeat` option causes multiple clicks to be sent in quick succession, creating the effect of holding down the mouse button and clicking repeatedly. This can be useful for automating repetitive tasks, such as clicking on a button or link multiple times.'
        window: '[AI] `xdotool click --window` is a command-line tool in Linux for automating user interface interactions. The `click` action is used to simulate a mouse click on a specific window based on its identifier, which can be obtained using various methods like its title or ID number. By specifying `--window`, xdotool limits the click action to only that particular window. This functionality can be useful for writing scripts that automate common tasks by clicking buttons or links in open applications.'
