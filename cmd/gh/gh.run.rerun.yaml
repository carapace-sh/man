description: Rerun a run
flags:

    -j, --job=: Rerun a specific job from a run, including dependencies
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `gh run rerun` command is used in GitHub Actions to trigger a re-run of the last failed workflow job in a repository. This command helps to automatically fix common build or test issues without requiring manual intervention, by executing the job again from the point of failure. It saves time and effort for developers, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.'
    flag:
        debug: '[AI] `gh run rerun --debug` is a command used in GitHub Actions workflows to trigger the re-execution of a specific workflow job or workflow run. The `--debug` flag enables more detailed logging output for better debugging and troubleshooting. When you use this command, GitHub Actions will rerun the specified job or workflow with all the environment variables, secrets, and inputs from the original run, as well as providing additional debug information during the execution process.'
        failed: '[AI] The `gh run rerun --failed` command is used with GitHub Actions to re-run failed workflows or jobs in a previous workflow run. This can be helpful when you have made modifications to your codebase that might fix issues causing the failure and you want to see if those changes resolved the problem. Running `gh run rerun --failed` triggers GitHub Actions to execute only the failed steps from the previous run, potentially saving time compared to running the entire workflow again.'
        job: |-
            [AI] The `gh run rerun --job` command is used in GitHub Actions to trigger the re-execution of a specific job from a previous workflow run. This command is part of GitHub's GitHubActions CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, which allows developers to manage their GitHub Actions programmatically.

            Here are the key points:

            1. `gh run`: This is the main command for managing GitHub Actions with the CLI. It requires authentication via GitHub's personal access tokens.
            2. `rerun`: This is a subcommand that allows you to re-run specific jobs from past workflow runs.
            3. `--job`: This option is used to specify the name or index of the job that you want to re-run.
            4. The command should be executed from the root directory of your GitHub repository, preferably inside a terminal or command prompt.
