By default, Flutter uses the stable channel which receives regular releases. However, you can also use other channels like master (development) or beta for accessing new features and bug fixes before they are released. To set a specific channel, run `flutter channel <channel_name>` in your terminal or command prompt. For example, `flutter channel master` will switch to the development channel.'
