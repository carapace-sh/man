documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `go-tool-cov` is a part of the Go toolchain used for collecting and analyzing coverage data during testing. The `debugdump` subcommand is used to print out detailed information about the coverage data in a human-readable format. It can be helpful for debugging testing issues, understanding testing blind spots, or for further analysis using external tools. The output includes line numbers, function names, and the percentage of executed lines for each source file.'
    flag:
        cpuprofile: |-
            [AI] The `go-tool-covdata debugdump` command is a part of the Go programming language's `govmtools` package, which provides various profiling and coverage analysis tools. This specific command is used to debug CPU profiles saved during Go program execution.

            The `debugdump` subcommand dumps the detailed CPU profile data to a file for further analysis. The `-cpuprofile` flag specifies the name of the existing CPU profile file to be analyzed. When executed, it generates an output in a human-readable format that lists the functions and their corresponding call durations in the program, helping developers identify performance bottlenecks and optimize their code.
        hw: |-
            [AI] The `go-tool-covdata` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language's standard library for handling coverage data. The specific command `go-tool-covdata debugdump -hw` has the following meaning:

            1. `go-tool-covdata`: Invokes the Go coverage data tool with the name `covdata`.
            2. `debugdump`: Specifies that the tool should use the "debugdump" subcommand, which is used to print out raw and detailed coverage profile data in a human-readable format.
            3. `-h` or `--help`: Displays help information about the debugdump subcommand, including its usage and available options. This option is typically used when the user wants more information on how to use the command.
            4. `-w` or `--wide`: Enables wide format output for the coverage data, which displays column headers for each source file line and their corresponding numbers of hits, missed, and total executions. By default, covdata may only display aggregated coverage information. This option is useful when working with large projects and want to see the fine-grained details of individual source files' coverage.
        i: '[AI] `go-tool-covdata` is a command-line tool in Go''s `$GOPATH/tools/cover` directory. The `debugdump` subcommand, when used with the `-i` option, prints out detailed coverage data for a specific test case or function in the given Go source file. The input to this command (specified by the `-i` flag) is the absolute path of the `.out` file generated during Go testing, which contains the coverage information. In summary, it''s used for debugging and understanding the code coverage of specific parts of a Go program.'
        live: '[AI] The command `go-tool-covdata debugdump -live` is a part of the Go coverage tooling. This specific command is used to print out live coverage data for a running Go program. When executed, it dumps the current coverage data in real time as the program is being executed. It can help developers identify which parts of their code are being hit during runtime and which aren''t, allowing them to optimize their code accordingly.'
        memprofile: '[AI] The `go-tool-covdata` is a command-line tool from the Go programming language''s standard library used for code coverage analysis. The specific command `go-tool-covdata debugdump -memprofile` dumps memory profile data from a Go program''s debug information. This data provides detailed insights into memory allocations, stack traces, and other information related to a program''s runtime memory usage. When using this command, it reads the coverage data files produced during testing, then extracts and prints the memory profile information, which can be used for further performance analysis and optimization.'
        memprofilerate: |-
            [AI] The `go-tool-covdata debugdump -memprofilerate` command is used in Go programming language for memory profiling. Here's a brief explanation of what each part means:

            1. `go-tool-covdata`: This is the name of the Go tool that generates and processes coverage data.
            2. `debugdump`: This is a subcommand of the covdata tool, which dumps the internal data structures of the program being profiled.
            3. `-memprofilerate`: This flag instructs the tool to output memory profile data instead of coverage data. The number before "memprofilerate" specifies the rate at which the memory snapshot is taken (e.g., -memprofilrate=100 sets the snapshot rate to 100 Hz).
            4. Overall, this command generates a detailed memory usage profile for the Go program being profiled, which can help identify memory leaks and other memory-related issues.
        pkg: '[AI] `go-tool-covdata` is a command-line tool in the Go programming language''s `$GOPATH/tools/cover` directory. The `debugdump` subcommand, when run with the `-pkg` option followed by a package path, prints detailed coverage profile information for that specific package. This data can help developers identify which parts of their code are not being executed during testing and optimize test cases accordingly.'
        v: '[AI] The command `go-tool-covdata debugdump -v` is used in Go programming language to print detailed information about the coverage data stored in a .cover file. The option `-v` increases the verbosity of the output, providing more extensive details about each line of code covered during testing. In essence, it helps developers understand which lines were executed and how many times they were tested for better code analysis and improvement.'
