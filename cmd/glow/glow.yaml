    command: |-
        [AI] The `glow` command is not a standard or widely used command in computing or graphics, and it's meaning can vary depending on the context. Here are a few possibilities:

        1. In the context of image editing or graphic design software, `glow` might refer to an effect that adds a halo or radiant border around objects or text. This is often used to make subjects stand out from their backgrounds and give a glamorous or dramatic look.
        2. In computer graphics or 3D modeling, `glow` could refer to a shader or material property that emits light in various ways, creating an illuminated effect on surfaces.
        3. In the context of programming, particularly with regards to machine learning or neural networks, `glow` is the name of an open-source deep learning framework for building and deploying ML models in Rust language. It's designed for inference on mobile and embedded devices, with a focus on size, latency, and ease of use.
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `glow --all` is a command for the Glow library, which is a machine learning library written in Rust. The `--all` flag is used to apply data preprocessing and training on all specified datasets in one go. It combines steps such as loading data, feature extraction, model selection, and training into a single workflow. This can save time and resources compared to running each step individually for every dataset.'
        help: '[AI] `glow --help` is a command used in Glow, a machine learning library for generating and manipulating neural networks, to display help information about the Glow CLI (Command Line Interface). This command provides an overview of the available Glow commands, their usage, and optional arguments. It assists users in understanding how to use Glow effectively for various machine learning tasks.'
        local: '[AI] `glow --local` is a command used in Glow, a machine learning framework for deep learning models. It runs the Glow model training locally on the machine where it''s executed. The `--local` flag specifies that the training process will be run on the local machine rather than using a distributed training setup or cloud services. This is useful when working with smaller datasets or for quick experimentation.'
        mouse: '[AI] The `glow --mouse` command is a flag or option used in various tools, particularly image editing software, that enhances the brightness or intensity of pixels under the mouse pointer. It can be useful for previewing changes to an image before applying them permanently or for making precise selections with increased visibility.'
        pager: '[AI] `glow --pager` is a flag used with the Glow CLI (Command Line Interface) tool in data engineering and data analysis workflows. It specifies that the output of a Glow command should be piped to a pager for scrollable display, such as less or more, instead of being printed directly to the terminal. This is helpful when dealing with large datasets or logs where the entire output cannot fit in the terminal at once.'
        style: '[AI] The `--style glow` option in a command or tool refers to applying a specific visual effect called "glow" to an element or image. Glow is a lighting effect that makes the edges of an object appear to emit light, giving it a halo or glowing appearance. This can be used for various design purposes such as making text or logos stand out on images or creating artistic effects. The implementation and usage of `--style glow` may vary depending on the specific tool or software being used.'
        version: '[AI] `glow --version` is a command used in the Glow data processing tool to check and display the currently installed version of the Glow software. It provides information on the major, minor, and patch release numbers, as well as any accompanying build metadata. This command helps users ensure they have the most recent version of Glow installed or troubleshoot compatibility issues with other tools or datasets.'
        width: '[AI] The `glow` is not a standard command or option in Unix-like operating systems. It seems to be specific to certain software or tools, and its usage with the option `--width` can vary depending on the context. In general, though, the `--width` option is used to set the width of an output or display. For example, in the context of a text-based image editor like `imagemagick`, the command `convert image.jpg -resize x100%x -negaise -negate -unsharp 5x5+0.5+0.5 -colors 32 -alpha Set -background white -define glow:radius=10 -define glow:opacity=70 -define glow:distance=5 -define glow:scatter=150 -define glow:saturation=80 -define glow:angle=0 -extent 256x256 x:image.png +swap y:glow \!-compose srcOut Destination.png` applies various image processing functions to an input image and generates a new image with a glowing effect using the `glow` definition, which includes the options `--radius`, `--opacity`, `--distance`, `--scatter`, `--saturation`, and `--angle`. The exact meaning and effects of each option can depend on the specific software implementation of the `glow` filter.'
