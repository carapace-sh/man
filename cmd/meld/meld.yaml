documentation:
    command: '[AI] "Meld" is a free, open-source graphical three-way and four-way merge tool for comparing and merging both files and directories. It allows users to visually review differences between files or branches, resolve conflicts, and apply changes. Meld uses a Mercurial backend but can be used with other version control systems as well by configuring the merge driver appropriately. It offers an intuitive interface for users to manipulate changes, making it a popular choice for resolving merge conflicts in software development projects.'
    flag:
        auto-compare: '[AI] `meld --auto-compare` is a command-line option for the Meld merge tool. It automatically launches the Merge Three-Way dialog when used with `meld file1 file2`. Instead of manually opening files for comparison, this flag initiates the comparison process immediately. This can save time and effort in situations where you need to compare multiple files and want to automate the comparison process.'
        auto-merge: '[AI] `meld --auto-merge` is a command-line option for the Meld merge tool. It enables the automatic merging of both branches or files into a single file with conflicts marked. The tool attempts to resolve the differences itself and provides an editor interface for users to review and adjust any unresolved conflicts before saving the merged result. This can be useful in streamlining the merge process when there are many files or simple changes, reducing the amount of manual intervention required.'
        comparison-file: '[AI] The `--comparison-file` option in Meld, a popular graphical diff and merging tool, specifies a file to save the result of the diff or merge operation as a Meld session. This session file can then be loaded later for further comparison or merging. It is useful for saving intermediate results or sharing differences between multiple versions of files with others for collaborative workflows.'
        diff: '[AI] `meld --diff` is a command-line tool provided by Meld, a graphical file comparison and merging tool. The `--diff` option instructs Meld to produce textual output of the differences between two files instead of displaying them in its graphical interface. This can be useful when integrating differences into scripts or automated workflows. The output shows additions as `+`, deletions as `-`, and common changes as `<<<` for removals before the change, `>>>` for additions after the change, and `|||` for identical sections.'
        help: '[AI] `meld --help` displays a brief help message about the Meld merge tool. It lists the possible command-line options and their functions, including opening a file or directory for three-way comparison and merging differences interactively or automatically using predefined strategies. Additionally, it explains how to use various keyboard shortcuts during the merging process.'
        label: '[AI] `meld --label` is a command-line option for the Meld merge tool. It allows users to assign custom labels to merge changesets, helping to differentiate and manage them during the merging process. This can be useful when dealing with multiple related changes or resolving conflicts in complex projects.'
        newtab: '[AI] `meld --newtab` is a command used by the Meld merge tool for version control systems. This command opens a new tab in Meld, preparing it to handle a new merge operation or comparison of files. When executed, a new tab will appear with an empty workspace, ready to be populated with files or directories to be compared or merged.'
        output: '[AI] `meld --output` is a command-line option for the Meld merge tool. It specifies the output format of Meld when merging files. By default, Meld opens a graphical user interface to show the differences and allow users to manually resolve them. However, with the `--output` option, Meld can generate an output file instead. This output file can be in various formats such as patch (`--output=patch:`), text (`--output=text:>, text:file:`), or Mercurial''s change log format (`--output=mq:>file`). The generated file(s) can then be applied to other versions of the files using other tools.'
        unified: '[AI] `meld --unified` is a command-line option for the Meld merge tool. It instructs Meld to perform a three-way merge using the unified diff format. In this mode, changes are presented as additions and deletions marked with "+" and "-" symbols, respectively, along with context lines for better context. This is useful when merging text files and can help users visually identify and resolve conflicts more easily.'
        version: '[AI] `meld --version` is a command used in the Meld merge tool to display the current version of the software. When executed in a terminal or command prompt, it returns a string containing the Meld version number and other relevant information such as the build date and operating system. This can be useful for checking which version of Meld is installed and for troubleshooting any potential compatibility issues with other tools or environments.'
