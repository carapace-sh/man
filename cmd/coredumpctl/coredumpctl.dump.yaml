documentation:
    command: '[AI] `coredumpctl dump` is a command used in Linux systems for managing and handling core dumps generated during program crashes. This command instructs the coredump control daemon (`systemd-coredump`) to produce and output the contents of a core dump file to a specified location or by default, to the standard output stream. It can be useful for debugging software that has crashed unexpectedly, as the core dump file provides detailed information about the state of the program at the time of failure.'
