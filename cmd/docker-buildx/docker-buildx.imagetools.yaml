documentation:
    command: '[AI] `docker buildx imagetools` is a set of commands provided by Docker Buildx, an extension to the standard Docker CLI that enables building multi-stage and productions-ready Docker images using multiple buildx drivers (for example, docker-buildx install qemu). The `imagetools` subcommand provides additional functionalities for managing image builds, such as creating buildx projects, inspecting build progress, and managing build cache. For instance, you can use `docker buildx create --use` to create a new buildx project or `docker buildx bake <project>` to start building an image based on the project configuration.'
