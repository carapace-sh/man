    command: '[AI] The `whoami` command is a simple and essential utility in Unix-based systems, including Linux and MacOS.

By executing `whoami` in a terminal window, you can easily check your current username without needing to remember it or look it up in configuration files.'
    flag:
        help: '[AI] The `whoami` command with the `--help` option is used to display detailed help information about the `whoami` utility in Unix-like operating systems. It prints out a message describing what the command does, which is to print the username of the current user, and provides information on how to use it correctly, such as its syntax and any available options.'
        version: '[AI] `whoami --version` is not a command or flag in Unix or Linux systems but rather, `whoami` is a built-in command in these environments used to print the current user name. The `--version` option is typically associated with software or programs that have this capability, allowing users to check for the specific version of that application installed on their system. So, `whoami --version` does not exist and would result in an error message when entered in a terminal or command prompt.'
