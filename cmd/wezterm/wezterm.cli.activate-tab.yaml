        help: |-
            [AI] `wezterm cli activate-tab` is a command in WezTerm, a terminal emulator, used to programmatically activate a specific tab in the terminal window. The `--help` option provides information about how to use this command effectively.

            Here's a brief explanation of the help output:

            - `activate-tab [OPTIONS] TAB_INDEX`: This is the main command syntax, where `TAB_INDEX` represents the index of the tab you want to activate.
            - Options include:
              - `--sync` or `-s`: Synchronously wait for the tab activation to complete before continuing with further commands.
              - `--no-sync` or `-n`: Asynchronously activate the tab without waiting for its activation to complete (default).

            The help message provides more detailed explanations of these options, including their default values and how they impact the behavior of the command.
        no-wrap: '[AI] The `wezterm cli activate-tab --no-wrap` command is used in WezTerm, a terminal emulator for Unix and Windows systems. This specific command activates the currently selected tab in WezTerm without wrapping long lines. The `--no-wrap` option disables line wrapping, allowing users to see long lines in their terminal output without being truncated at the edge of the terminal window.'
        pane-id: '[AI] The command `wezterm cli activate-tab --pane-id` is a Wezterm terminal emulator command used to activate a specific tab in a multi-tab terminal session. The `--pane-id` option is used to identify the pane within the activated tab that should be brought into focus. This command allows users to programmatically control their terminal sessions, for example, as part of automation scripts or keybindings.'
        tab-id: '[AI] The command `wezterm cli activate-tab --tab-id <ID>` is a Wezterm terminal emulator command used to bring the tab with the specified ID into focus. Wezterm, a modern terminal emulator, allows users to open multiple tabs within a single window, each with its own unique ID. By using this command, you can quickly switch between different tabs without having to click on them in the tab bar. The `<ID>` is a number representing the specific tab you want to activate.'
        tab-index: '[AI] The `wezterm cli activate-tab --tab-index <index>` command is used in Wezterm terminal emulator to bring the tab with the given index into focus. The index is a zero-based number representing the position of the tab within all open tabs in the terminal window. This command can be helpful when managing multiple tabs and wanting to quickly switch between them using the command line interface.'
        tab-relative: '[AI] The `wezterm cli activate-tab --tab-relative` command is a WezTerm terminal emulator''s CLI (Command Line Interface) instruction for activating the tab in the current window relative to its position. This means, if there are multiple tabs in the current window, and this command is run while a specific tab is selected or focused, it will not change the selection, but if no tab is currently selected, then the next or previous tab will be activated based on their left-to-right order within the same window.'
