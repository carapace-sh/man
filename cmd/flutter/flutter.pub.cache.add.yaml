    command: '[AI] `flutter pub cache add` is a command used in Flutter development to add or update dependencies listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file without modifying it directly. This command retrieves and caches the specified package from the Flutter packages registry, making it ready for use in your project without having to download it again each time you run your app. It ensures that your project uses consistent versions of its dependencies by leveraging the `flutter_tools` cache mechanism.'
    flag:
        all: '[AI] `flutter pub cache add --all` is a command used in the Flutter framework for adding or updating all the packages listed in the project''s `pubspec.yaml` file to the local package cache. This can be useful when you want to ensure that your project has the latest versions of its dependencies before building or running the code. The command retrieves and installs the necessary packages from the specified source (usually `git` or `hosted` repositories) and saves them in the `~/.pub-cache/hosted` directory. This can save time during builds as the packages are already locally cached instead of having to be downloaded each time.'

            [AI] `flutter pub cache add` is a command-line utility provided by the Flutter framework used to add or update dependencies in the `pubspec.yaml` file without modifying it directly. The `--help` option provides detailed usage information about this specific command. When you run `flutter pub cache add --help`, it displays the following:

            * Adds a new dependency to the cache, which will be included in the next application build.
            * If a package already exists, updates it to the latest version available in `pub.dev`.
            * Usage: `flutter pub cache add <package_name>`

            Additional options include:

            * `--mode=dev` or `--mode=release`: Specify development (default) or release mode when adding dependencies.
            * `--version=<version_number>`: Install a specific version of the package instead of the latest one.
        version: '[AI] `flutter pub cache add --version` is a command used in Flutter development. It adds a specific version of a package to the local `pubspec.yaml` file and the local cache, allowing you to use that exact version in your project without updating it globally. This can be useful for ensuring consistency across multiple projects or for working with older versions of packages.'
