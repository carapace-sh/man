    command: |-
        [AI] The `nix-hash` command is a tool from Nix package manager used to compute file hashes with various algorithms like SHA-1, SHA-256, etc. The `to-base64` is not a built-in option for `nix-hash`. However, you can combine these commands by piping the output of `nix-hash` into `base64`, which is a separate utility used to encode binary data as base64 strings:

        ```bash
        nix-hash <file> --algorithm=<hash-algorithm> | base64
        ```

        This command computes the hash of a file using the specified algorithm and pipes the output to `base64`, which then encodes the binary hash data as a base64 string.
    flag:
        debug: |-
            [AI] The command `nix-hash` is a utility provided by Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. It computes cryptographic hashes of files or directories using various algorithms like SHA256 or MD5.

            The option `--to-base64` instructs `nix-hash` to output the hash in Base64 encoding instead of its raw binary format. This can be useful for displaying hashes as human-readable strings in environments where raw binary data might not be supported.

            The `--debug` option enables verbose debug output, which may provide additional information about the files being hashed and the progress of the hash computation. It can be helpful for troubleshooting and understanding what `nix-hash` is doing behind the scenes.
        log-format: '[AI] The `nix-hash` command is a utility in Nix package manager for calculating and displaying various hashes of files or directories. The option `--to-base64` specifies that the output should be encoded in Base64 format, making it safe for use in environments that do not support raw hash values. The option `--log-format` is used to customize the output format of log messages generated by Nix. For example, `--log-format "%h %p: %T %s\n"` would display hashes with file paths, timestamps, and messages on a single line separated by newline characters. Together, these options generate Base64-encoded hash values that can be easily logged or transmitted.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] The command `nix-hash` is a tool from Nix, a package manager for Linux and other operating systems. This specific command generates a cryptographic hash of a file or build output using a selected algorithm, like SHA256 or SHA3, and then converts the binary hash output to base64 format using the `--print-build-logs` option. The base64 representation is often more convenient to work with as it can be easily represented in text format, transmitted over various channels, and compared visually. The combined effect of this command is to produce a human-readable base64 hash value for a file or build output.'
        quiet: '[AI] The command `nix-hash` is a utility from Nix Package Manager used to compute cryptographic hashes of files. The option `--to-base64` specifies that the output should be encoded in Base64 format instead of the default hexadecimal representation. The option `--quiet` suppresses all output except the hash value itself. So, this command computes the hash of a file using a specified algorithm (implicitly SHA-256 in Nix), encodes it in Base64 and prints only the encoded hash value without any additional information or messages.'
        type: '[AI] `nix-hash` is a command from Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. It computes cryptographic hashes of files or directories. The option `--to-base64` specifies that the output should be encoded in Base64 format, which is a common data encoding scheme that represents binary data as printable ASCII characters. The option `--type` is used to specify the type of hash algorithm to use, such as SHA256 or MD5. Together, these options result in computing and displaying a cryptographic hash value in Base64 format.'
        verbose: '[AI] The command `nix-hash` with the option `--to-base64 --verbose` generates a base64-encoded representation of a file''s cryptographic hash using Nix Hash, which is a part of the Nix package manager system. The `--verbose` flag increases the output''s verbosity, providing additional information like the hash algorithm used and the progress as the hashing process takes place.'
