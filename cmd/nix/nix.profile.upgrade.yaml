documentation:
    command: '[AI] `nix-profile upgrade` is a command used in Nix Pakages Manager to apply available updates to the installed Nix profile. A Nix profile is a collection of software packages managed by Nix, which can be configured and isolated from other systems. Running `nix-profile upgrade` will fetch and install any new versions or patches for the currently installed packages, keeping your system up-to-date with the latest Nix software.'
    flag:
        arg: '[AI] `nix-profile upgrade --arg` is a command used in Nix packaging system to perform an upgraded installation or reconfiguration of a specific package with additional arguments passed through the `--arg` option. The exact behavior depends on the argument provided, but generally, it allows specifying custom build or configuration options during the upgrade process. For example, `nix-profile upgrade --arg ''myPackage?arg1=value''` could be used to pass an optional argument `arg1=value` during the upgrade of `myPackage`.'
        argstr: |-
            [AI] `nix-profile` is a command-line utility in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems. The `upgrade` subcommand is used to update the installed Nix package manager itself, as well as any installed Nix profiles.

            The option `--argstr` is used to pass arguments to a specific Nix expression or command during the upgrade process. This can be useful for specifying certain options or configurations when upgrading specific packages or profiles. For example, you might use `--argstr 'someOption someValue'` to enable a particular feature when upgrading a specific profile.

            So, in summary, `nix-profile upgrade --argstr` is used to upgrade Nix and/or profiles while passing arguments to the upgraded expressions or commands.
        commit-lock-file: |-
            [AI] `nix-profile upgrade --commit-lock-file` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command upgrades all installed packages in the current system profile to their latest available versions while creating a new commit lock file.

            The commit lock file records the exact version of each installed package at that point in time. It ensures that the upgraded packages will not be accidentally updated again by other concurrent Nix commands or processes until the lock file is removed. This feature helps maintain system stability and consistency during multiple concurrent updates.
        debug: '[AI] `nix-profile upgrade --debug` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command initiates an upgrade of the Nix profile installed on the system, which includes updating the Nix package manager itself as well as any installed packages. The `--debug` flag enables verbose output during the upgrade process, providing more detailed information about what is being updated and any potential issues that may arise.'
        debugger: '[AI] `nix-profile upgrade --debugger` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. The command initiates an upgrade of the Nix profile installed on the system, which includes installing or updating packages and their dependencies. The `--debugger` flag enables a more detailed output of the upgrade process, providing debug information to help diagnose any issues that may occur during the upgrade. This can be useful for troubleshooting and understanding the underlying causes of errors or unexpected behavior.'
        eval-store: '[AI] `nix-profile upgrade --eval-store` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command performs an upgrade of all installed packages in the current system configuration (represented by the `nix-profile` directory) using the Nix expression language evaluated from the Nix store instead of the previously cached expressions. This allows users to apply changes that were not yet propagated to their cache, or to evaluate expressions with the latest available versions of dependencies. The `--eval-store` option instructs Nix to read and evaluate the expressions directly from the Nix store rather than using the locally cached copies.'
        impure: '[AI] `nix-profile upgrade --impure` is a command used in Nix packaging system to perform an impure upgrade of installed packages. This means that the upgrade process will not preserve the current system configuration or user customizations. Instead, it updates the packages to their newest versions and potentially overwrites existing files and configurations. It is often used when you want to apply changes from a new package version without keeping previous customizations.'
        include: '[AI] `nix-profile upgrade --include` is a Nix package manager command used to install and upgrade new packages or updates for currently installed packages in the Nix profile. The `--include` option allows specifying a list of packages to be acted upon, either by their names or Nix expressions. It upgrades the named packages only if they have newer versions available, and it also installs any dependencies required by those packages. This command is typically used when managing system configurations with Nix.'
        inputs-from: |-
            [AI] The `nix-profile upgrade --inputs-from` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems, to perform an upgrade of all installed packages using specific inputs.

            Inputs are files that define the exact version or configuration of packages to be installed. With the `--inputs-from` option, you can provide a list of input files, typically in Nix expression format (`.nix`), instead of allowing Nix to choose the latest versions by default. This way, you have more control over which packages and their versions are being upgraded during the command execution.
        log-format: '[AI] `nix-profile upgrade` is a command in Nix Package Manager for updating the system''s Nix configuration to the latest stable version. The option `--log-format` specifies the format of the log output generated during the upgrade process. By default, it outputs logs using plain text format. However, you can customize it to display logs in JSON or other formats, making it easier for scripting or automated processes to consume the log data.'
        no-registries: '[AI] The `nix-profile upgrade --no-registries` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other systems, to perform an upgrade of installed packages without checking or using any external package repositories or registries. This means that only the locally available packages will be upgraded with this command. The `--no-registries` flag ensures that Nix looks for updates only among the currently installed packages and their dependencies, rather than consulting any remote servers or caches.'
        no-update-lock-file: '[AI] The `nix-profile upgrade --no-update-lock-file` command is used in Nix Package Manager to perform an upgrade of all installed packages without creating or using a lock file during the process. A lock file ensures that the exact same versions of packages are installed across different build sessions, but it can also cause issues when multiple users have write access to the same Nix profile or when performing upgrades in an automated environment. Therefore, the `--no-update-lock-file` option is used to skip creating or using a lock file and allow for more flexibility during package upgrades.'
        no-write-lock-file: '[AI] The `nix-profile upgrade --no-write-lock-file` command is used in Nix Package Manager to perform an upgrade of installed packages without creating a write lock file. This option is useful when you want to perform an upgrade without preventing other concurrent upgrades or builds, making it faster for large-scale environments with multiple instances. It''s important to note that using this flag might result in conflicts if multiple systems are attempting to install or upgrade the same package at the same time.'
        override-flake: '[AI] `nix-profile upgrade --override-flake` is a Nix Package Manager command used to perform an upgrade of the Nix profile installations, while applying specific overrides to individual packages defined in a Flake configuration file. In other words, it allows users to apply updates to their installed packages while keeping custom configurations for certain packages. This can be useful when there are compatibility issues between package versions or when specific customizations are required.'
        override-input: '[AI] `nix-profile upgrade --override-input` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command upgrades the user''s Nix profile, which is a directory containing configuration and user installations, to the latest version available in the Nix repositories. The `--override-input` option allows users to specify a specific package input to be installed or replaced during the upgrade process. This can be useful if you want to force the installation of a particular version or override an existing package configuration.'
        print-build-logs: '[AI] `nix-profile upgrade --print-build-logs` is a Nix command that triggers an upgrades of installed Nix packages, and then prints the build logs for each package upgrade to the terminal. It allows users to see the details of the build process, including any errors or warnings, which can be helpful in troubleshooting or understanding what changes were made during the upgrade.'
        profile: '[AI] `nix-profile upgrade --profile` is a command in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command is used to upgrade a specific Nix profile to its latest version. A Nix profile is a collection of packages managed by Nix, and upgrading a profile ensures that all the installed packages within it are updated to their newest versions. The `--profile` option specifies which profile to upgrade.'
        quiet: '[AI] `nix-profile upgrade --quiet` is a command in Nix Package Manager. It upgrades the installed Nix profile to the latest version silently, without displaying any progress messages during the installation process. This can be useful for scripting or automation where you don''t want to see the output of each update step.'
        recreate-lock-file: |-
            [AI] The `nix-profile upgrade --recreate-lock-file` command is used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command recreates or generates a new lock file (`nix-profile.lock`) in the Nix profile directory.

            When you install or upgrade packages using Nix, it manages dependencies by creating a lock file to ensure consistency across different systems and prevent version conflicts. If there are issues with the existing lock file, such as corruptions or inconsistencies, running this command will create a new one and allow for a clean installation or upgrade process.
        update-input: '[AI] The `nix-profile upgrade --update-input` command is used in Nix packaging system to update the available inputs for installation or upgrading of software packages. It retrieves and indexes the latest available versions of software packages and their dependencies from the Nixpkgs or other configuration servers, allowing users to easily manage updates and install new software. It does not actually install or upgrade any packages but makes the updated versions available for selection when using `nix-env` or other Nix tools.'
        verbose: '[AI] `nix-profile upgrade --verbose` is a command used in Nix, a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. This command upgrades the Nix profile installed on your system to the latest version, printing detailed information about each step of the upgrade process using the `--verbose` flag. It ensures that all components are updated to their newest versions while providing real-time feedback, enabling users to better understand the changes being made to their system.'
