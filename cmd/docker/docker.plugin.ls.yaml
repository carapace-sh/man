documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `docker plugin ls` command is used to list all installed Docker plugins in your system. Plugins extend the functionality of Docker, and they can be used for various tasks such as volume drivers, network plugins, or other custom functionalities. This command displays a table with the name, description, version, and status (enabled or disabled) of each installed plugin.'
    flag:
        filter: '[AI] `docker plugin ls --filter` is a command used in Docker to list installed plugins with specific filtering. The `--filter` option allows you to apply filters to the output based on certain conditions, such as matching the plugin name or its status (enabled or disabled). This command helps manage your Docker plugins more effectively by allowing you to easily view and filter the installed plugins in your system.'
        format: '[AI] `docker plugin ls --format` is a command used in Docker to list installed plugins along with customized formatting options. The `--format` option allows specifying an output template for the command, which can be used to extract specific data from the plugin list. This command provides information about the available plugins, such as their names, descriptions, versions, and publishers, in a user-defined format.'
        no-trunc: '[AI] The `docker plugin ls --no-trunc` command is used to list all installed Docker plugins with their full names and versions, without truncating the output. The `--no-trunc` flag prevents the output from being truncated to fit within a single terminal line. This command provides a comprehensive view of installed plugins, making it useful for identifying and managing plugin versions.'
        quiet: '[AI] The `docker plugin ls --quiet` command is used to list all installed Docker plugins in a minimal format. The `--quiet` option suppresses the display of table headers and other extraneous output, returning only the names of the installed plugins as plain text, separated by newline characters. This makes it suitable for use in scripts where you only need the list of plugins without any additional formatting or context information.'
