documentation:
    command: '[AI] `restic copy` is a command from the data backup and synchronization tool, restic. It''s used to create a new backup of existing data residing in the source location and store it as a new version or repository in the destination location. Essentially, it copies data from one place to another while maintaining the incremental and deduplicated backup functionality that restic offers.'
    flag:
        host: '[AI] The `restic copy --host` command is used in the data backup and sync tool, `restic`. This command specifically copies data between hosts using `restic`. The `--host` flag indicates that the source or destination is a remote host which can be accessed via SSH. The command will transfer the data over SSH encrypted connection. In summary, `restic copy --host` allows you to make backups or sync data between different hosts securely.'
        key-hint2: '[AI] The `restic copy --key-hint2` command in the context of Restic, a backup program, is used to copy backups from one location to another using a specific key for identification. The `--key-hint2` option is provided with this command to specify the second part of a backup key, which helps ensure that only the intended data is restored during the copy process. By providing this hint, Restic can accurately locate and retrieve the desired backups from its storage, maintaining the security and integrity of the backed-up data.'
        password-command2: |-
            [AI] `restic` is a backup program that allows efficient incremental backups using the Git data model. The command `restic copy --password-command2` is used to initiate a new backup or restore operation, with `copy` specifying a copy action.

            The option `--password-command2` indicates that an external command should be run to provide the second password (or passphrase) required for encryption or decryption of the data being backed up or restored. This command is typically used when the backup target is located in an unsecured environment, and additional security measures are needed to protect sensitive data.
        password-file2: '[AI] The `restic copy` command is used in the data backup tool called Restic to create a new backup of existing data with the same configuration as an existing backup set. The `--password-file2` option specifies the path to a file containing the second password required for encrypted backups. This option ensures that the backup data remains secure by requiring multiple passwords for access.'
        path: '[AI] `restic copy` is a command from the data backup tool `restic`. The `--path` option specifies the source file or directory path to be copied. When used with `copy`, this command creates a new backup of the specified files or directories in your chosen backup repository. Unlike moving or archiving, copying keeps the original files unchanged and creates a separate backup entry for each copied item in the backup catalog.'
        repo2: '[AI] The `restic copy --repo2` command is used with the data backup tool, Restic. This command is for creating a new backup repository from an existing one. The `--repo2` option specifies the source repository location or URL. The new repository will be created in a location specified by the user. This command allows users to easily create replicas of their backups for data redundancy or geographic distribution.'
        repository-file2: '[AI] The `restic copy --repository-file2` command is used in Restic, a backup program that provides efficient incremental backups and deduplication storage. The `copy` subcommand performs a copy operation between two repositories, while `--repository-file2` specifies the second repository file as an argument. This means the data will be copied from one repository to another, creating a new backup of the source data in the destination repository. This command is typically used for synchronizing backups across multiple locations or for creating offsite backups.'
        tag: '[AI] `restic copy --tag` is a command used in the data backup and synchronization tool, Restic. This command copies backups or snapshot data from one location to another within the same repository, maintaining the original tag labels during the process. The `--tag` option ensures that the restored data is associated with the same tag as the source data. This feature allows for versioned and labeled backup data to be easily moved between locations.'
