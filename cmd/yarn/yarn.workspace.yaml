documentation:
    command: '[AI] `yarn workspace` is a feature in Yarn package manager that allows managing multiple packages and projects within the same Yarn worktree as if they were independent projects. It enables sharing of common dependencies, running tests, building projects, or executing scripts across all projects with a single command using the `yarn run` or `yarn build` commands followed by the project-specific task name. This streamlines the development process and encourages modular code organization.'
