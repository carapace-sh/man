documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `deadcode` command is not a standard command in programming, as it depends on the specific development environment or toolchain being used. In general context, Dead Code Elimination (DCE) is an optimization technique used in compilers and interpreters to remove code that never gets executed during program execution. Identifying and removing dead code can lead to smaller binary sizes, faster compile times, and improved performance. The `deadcode` command could be a name given to a tool or feature providing Dead Code Elimination within a development environment or IDE.'
    flag:
        cpuprofile: '[AI] The `deadcode` command in Java with the option `-cpuprofiler` generates a CPU profiling report for the identified dead code in your Java application. Dead code refers to the parts of the code that are not executed during program execution, and identifying and removing them can help improve the application''s performance by reducing unnecessary computation. The `-cpuprofiler` option enables collecting CPU usage statistics for the identified dead code, providing insights into how much computational resources are being wasted on unexecuted code. This information can be used to optimize your Java application further.'
        filter: '[AI] The `deadcode` command is a part of the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) compiler suite, used for removing unused code from compiled programs to improve code size and execution speed. The `-filter` option is a modifier for the `deadcode` command, allowing users to selectively remove specific types of dead code based on certain criteria. For instance, `-filter ''dead_function/''*` will eliminate all functions marked as dead by GCC. This option can be particularly useful when targeting specific optimization goals or dealing with large projects.'
        generated: '[AI] The "deadcode-generated" flag is typically used in compiler optimization settings. It instructs the compiler to identify and remove code that is unreachable or has no effect on the program''s output. This optimization is called Dead Code Elimination (DCE). The generated deadcode refers to code produced during compilation that is later identified as unnecessary and eliminated by this optimization.'
        line: '[AI] The `-line` option in a compiler or interpreter''s "deadcode" mode is used to report warnings for lines of code that are not executed during the program flow. Dead code refers to parts of the program that have no effect on the result, such as unreachable statements or unused variables. By enabling the `-line` option, the tool will provide the line numbers where the dead code was found, helping developers identify and remove unnecessary code for potential performance gains or simplification.'
        memprofile: |-
            [AI] `deadcode` is a Go tool used to find and remove unused variables, functions, or code blocks during compilation. It helps in reducing the size of the generated binary and improving program performance by eliminating unnecessary elements.

            On the other hand, `memprofile` is a Go profiling option that generates memory usage profiles during the execution of the program. The resulting profile file can be analyzed using tools like `pprof` to identify memory allocation hotspots and track memory leaks or inefficient memory usage.

            The flag `deadcode -memprofile` combines both functionalities: it runs the Go compiler with the `deadcode` analysis (-deadcode flag) to remove unused code, and generates a memory profile (-memprofile flag) at the same time. This can help optimize the program for both performance (reducing unused code) and memory usage by addressing potential memory leaks or inefficient memory allocations.
        tags: '[AI] The `-tags` option in the `deadcode` command is used to specify one or more tags to exclude from the analysis during a static code analysis. Deadcode is a tool that helps identify and remove unused variables, functions, and other elements from Swift or Objective-C codebases. By using the `-tags` flag, developers can exclude specific tags, which are user-defined metadata, from being considered in the analysis process. This allows them to focus on specific parts of their codebase while ignoring others.'
        test: '[AI] The `deadcode -test` command is a test in the Dead Code tool of the IDE or build system for various programming languages, such as Haskell or OCaml. This command checks for code that is unreachable, meaning it will never be executed during program execution. Unreachable code is considered dead and can be safely removed to improve code quality and potentially optimization. By running `deadcode -test`, developers can identify and eliminate such unused and unnecessary code within their projects.'
