    command: '[AI] The `npm dist-tag ls` command is used to list all the distributions (versions) and their associated tags for a given npm package in your local npm registry. In other words, it shows you which versions of an npm package have been tagged with specific labels or names. This can be helpful when managing multiple versions of dependencies with different tags.'
