documentation:
    command: '[AI] "Micro" is a simple and lightweight text editor for Unix-based systems, written in C. It''s known for its fast startup time and minimal memory footprint, making it an ideal choice for users with limited resources or those who prefer a clean and straightforward editing experience. Micro supports various text editing features such as search and replace, undo/redo, cut, copy, paste, line numbers, and syntax highlighting for certain file types.'
    flag:
        autoindent: '[AI] The `micro-autoindent` flag in text editors like Micro or Vi is used to automatically adjust indentation levels based on the context of the code being edited. This means that when you press enter to start a new line, the indenter will adjust the indentation level according to the syntax rules of the language you''re working with. This can save time and reduce errors caused by manually setting indentation levels. It is especially useful for programming languages with specific indentation rules, such as Python or Java.'
        autosave: '[AI] The "micro-autosave" is a feature in some text editors, including Vim and Sublime Text, that automatically saves files at short intervals. The term "micro" refers to the small time interval between each save. This function aims to prevent data loss due to unexpected power outages or crashes by frequently saving the file. It is particularly useful for developers working on large projects or those who prefer not to manually save their work frequently.'
        autosu: '[AI] `micro-autosave` is a keybinding and script in the text editor Vim (Vi IMproved), which automatically saves modifications to a file every few seconds. This can help prevent data loss due to accidental loss of power or system crashes. The flag `micro-autosave` enables this feature when set in the Vim configuration file, typically located at `~/.vimrc`. It''s an essential setting for frequent editors who value data preservation and efficiency.'
        backup: '[AI] "micro-backup" is not a standard term or flag in computing or data backup. It seems to be a custom term, potentially referring to a micro-level or granular backup method where only small amounts of data are backed up at a time, rather than large backups that include entire files or databases. This could be useful for applications or systems where only specific changes need to be backed up frequently. The exact implementation and features would depend on the specific backup tool or solution using this term.'
        backupdir: '[AI] The `-backupdir` option in micro, a backup and archive tool, specifies the directory where all backup files will be stored by default. It does not create the directory itself. If this option is not provided, micro uses the system''s standard location for backups (which might not be ideal for every use case). By providing a specific path with `-backupdir`, users can ensure their backups are organized in a consistent and customizable way.'
        basename: '[AI] The `micros-basename` is a utility from the GNU CoreUtils package in Unix-like operating systems. It returns the base name of a file or a string, that is, the part after the prefix if any, and before the extension, if present. If no extension exists, it will return the entire name except for the directory path leading up to the file. The output is printed to the standard output stream. For example, given an input like `/path/to/myfile.txt`, the output would be `myfile.txt`.'
        clean: |-
            [AI] The `micro-clean` command is a utility provided by the `mico` text editor for Unix-based systems. It's used to delete all data in a micro file (a text file edited using micro), ensuring that the file is completely empty and its previous content is irrecoverably erased.

            When invoked, `micro-clean` overwrites existing data multiple times with random characters, making it difficult for data recovery tools to retrieve deleted information. It's often used when it's essential to remove sensitive or confidential data from a file without leaving any trace.
        clipboard: '[AI] The "micro-clipboard" is a concept in computational neuroscience and cognitive modeling, rather than a physical flag. It refers to a proposed model of working memory as a small, active buffer or clipboard, capable of holding only a limited amount of information at a time. This contrasts with the traditional view of working memory as a large, passive warehouse. The micro-clipboard model is based on neurophysiological evidence suggesting that the brain actively maintains and manipulates information in short-term memory by reactivating related neuronal representations.'
        colorcolumn: '[AI] `micro` is a terminal-based text editor, and the `--colorcolumn` option is one of its features. It enables the highlighting of specific columns in the text file being edited. This can be useful for lining up columns in tables or aligning code indentation. The columns to be highlighted are specified using regular expressions. For example, `--colorcolumn=80` highlights every 80th column. The option improves readability and visual organization of data within the terminal interface.'
        colorscheme: '[AI] The "micro-colorscheme" is a popular color theme for the terminal application, `Micro`, used in coding and text editing. It offers high contrast and clear visibility for different syntax elements, making it suitable for various programming languages and environments. Its design includes distinct colors for keywords, identifiers, constants, strings, comments, errors, and other text types. This scheme aims to enhance the readability and ease of use within Micro''s minimalistic interface.'
        config-dir: '[AI] The `--micro-config-dir` flag is a command line option for Docker, specifically for Docker Compose. It sets the directory where microservice configuration files, defined in YAML format with the extension `.yml` or `.yaml`, are located. These files define the services that make up a multi-container Docker application. By default, Docker Compose looks for these files in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file. Setting `--micro-config-dir` allows users to place their microservice configuration files in a separate directory.'
        cursorline: '[AI] `micro` is a text editor, and the `--cursorline` option is one of its features. It modifies the display to always show the position of the cursor as a line, making it easier to follow your editing progress, especially in longer files or when scrolling through them quickly.'
        debug: '[AI] The `micro-debug` flag is a command-line option used in some software development tools, particularly in the Rust programming language''s `micro` project. It enables the debug mode for the compiled code, providing more detailed output during execution and enabling features such as breakpoints and stepping through code. This can be useful for developers to diagnose issues, understand program flow, and inspect variables during runtime.'
        diffgutter: '[AI] The `--diff-gutter` flag in Git is used when displaying a diff output between two commits. It modifies the layout of the diff output to include an additional vertical gutter, making it easier to see the context of each hunk (a logical chunk of changes) within the diff. This can be useful for quickly identifying where specific changes occur in the file without having to scroll horizontally between the old and new versions of the code. The `--micro` option is not directly related to this flag but is instead used for displaying very fine-grained differences, showing each individual character change.'
        divchars: |-
            [AI] The `-divchars` option in GNU `make` is used to split a single file into multiple output files based on character or byte boundaries. The name `micro` in the flag context refers to the utility `dsort`, which is part of the GNU Core Utilities and is used for sorting lines or records.

            When using `-divchars` with `make`, you specify a regular expression as an argument. Make will then split the input file into output files based on where that regular expression matches a character boundary within the input file. For example, `-divchars='\n'` splits at newline characters. This can be useful for processing large input files in smaller chunks or for parallelizing build processes.
        divreverse: '[AI] `micro` is a text editor in the Unix-like operating systems. The `-divreverse` argument is not a valid option for `micro`. It seems like there''s a typo or misinterpretation of existing options. `micro` does have some options related to division, such as `-diff` and `-line-diff`, which are used for comparing files and displaying differences. However, there is no `-divreverse` option in the standard `micro` editor.'
        encoding: '[AI] Micro-encoding is a data compression technique used in text messages, emails, or digital files, where smaller variants of standard character encodings are employed to save space. Instead of using traditional encoding schemes like ASCII or Unicode that represent each character as a unique codepoint, micro-encoding compresses multiple characters into one representation, typically by combining diacritic marks with their base letters. This results in fewer bytes being required to transmit or store the data. However, receiving and decoding micro-encoded messages demands specific knowledge of the encoding scheme used. Micro-encoding is not standardized and varies between applications and platforms.'
        eofnewline: '[AI] The `micro --eof-newline` is a command-line option for the text editor, Micro. It specifies that Micro should add or keep a newline character at the end of files when saving them, even if the file being edited ends with just a carriage return (CR) character on Windows systems. This can make working with text files across different platforms more consistent.'
        fastdirty: |-
            [AI] The "micro-fastdirty" flag is a testing term used in the JUnit testing framework for JVM-based languages like Java. It instructs JUnit to run tests in the fastest possible way, even if it means skipping some tests marked as "Dirty".

            Tests are tagged as Dirty when their setup or teardown requires external resources that may change between test runs, such as files on disk or database tables. Running dirty tests can be time-consuming because their setup and teardown procedures need to check if the resource is still available or needs to be recreated.

            By using the micro-fastdirty flag, JUnit will skip running dirty tests during a test run. This can significantly speed up test execution, especially in continuous integration environments where many tests are run frequently. However, it's important to note that this approach may result in some tests being skipped, potentially missing errors or inconsistencies related to the dirty resources. It should be used with caution and as a last resort when running all tests is not an option due to time constraints.
        fileformat: '[AI] The Micro-File Format (MFF) is a simple text-based file format used by certain early microcomputers, including TRS-80 and Apple II, to store data for BASIC programs. MFF files consist of a series of ASCII characters that represent the BASIC code, variable assignments, and other data. The format includes a header line with identification information, followed by data lines in a specific order and format. It''s considered a minimalistic file format due to its simplicity and lack of advanced features compared to other file formats.'
        filetype: '[AI] The `-type` option in the `micromvn` or `mvn` command, when used with the `-f` option to specify a MicroXML (MX) file, displays the file type of the given MX file. For instance, if the file is an MX project file, it will output "application/vnd.maven.project". This information can be useful for automated build processes and scripts.'
        ignorecase: '[AI] The `-ignorecase` flag in regular expressions represented by the `re.IGNORECASE` constant in Python''s `re` module, is used to perform case insensitive matching. By default, regular expression patterns are case sensitive. However, when this flag is set, the pattern will match both upper and lower case characters, making the search more flexible and inclusive. For instance, if you search for the pattern ''apple'' with the `-ignorecase` flag enabled, it will also match strings like ''Apple'', ''apple'', or ''APPL''.'
        incsearch: '[AI] The `:micro` command in Vim is used to open a new split window, and the `:incsearch` option enables incremental search, which displays search results as they''re typed instead of waiting for the complete search term. Therefore, the combination `micro-incsearch` opens a new split window with incremental search enabled.'
        indentchar: '[AI] The `-indentchar` option in Micro, a minimalist text editor, sets the character used for indentation at the beginning of each line. By default, it is usually a tab character (`\t`). You can change it to any other character by specifying it as an argument to this flag when invoking Micro. For example, `micro file.txt -indentchar space` will set the indentation character to a space.'
        infobar: '[AI] The `micro-infobar` is a lightweight progress bar and status indicator for the popular terminal text editor, Micro. It provides real-time feedback during various operations like saving files or searching text within the editor. By default, it appears at the bottom of the terminal window, displaying the task name, percentage completion, and estimated time remaining. The infobar can be customized to show other information as well, such as elapsed time or memory usage. Its main goal is to improve user experience by keeping them informed about ongoing tasks in a clean and unobtrusive manner.'
        keepautoindent: '[AI] The `micro --keepautoindent` flag is a command-line option for the text editor, Micro. It preserves the current automatic indentation settings when opening a new file or creating a new one in the editor. This can be useful when working with files that have specific indentation requirements to maintain consistency across multiple files.'
        keymenu: '[AI] The `micro-keymenu` flag is used in the Micro text editor, a lightweight and configurable terminal-based text editor. This flag enables the interactive keymap menu within Micro, which allows users to quickly browse and apply keyboard shortcuts without needing to memorize specific key combinations. When this flag is set, pressing the `F10` key in Micro will open a list of available actions and their corresponding keys, enabling users to navigate through the list using arrow keys or the page up/down keys and select an action by pressing enter. The selected action will then be executed.'
        matchbrace: |-
            [AI] The `--micro-match` option is a flag used in GNU `grep`, a text searching tool. It modifies the behavior of `grep`'s regular expression pattern matching to perform substring matching instead of the default full line matching. The `--match-brace` option, when used with `--micro-match`, enables the interpretation of braces `{}` in the regular expression as character classes.

            For example, given a pattern such as `{a,b}c`, without `--match-brace`, it would match lines that contain "ac" or "bc". With `--match-brace`, it matches lines containing either "aac" or "bbc".
        mkparents: '[AI] The `make` command with the flags `-C` and `-m` followed by `microsystems/mkparents` refers to a specific Makefile named `mkparents`, which is part of the Microsystems RTLinux kernel build system. This Makefile is used to create parent directories for various subdirectories required during the compilation of the RTLinux kernel. The `-C` flag tells `make` to change into the build directory before executing any commands, while `-m` indicates that a specific Makefile will be used instead of the default one in the current directory. So, running `make -C <build_directory> -m microsystems/mkparents` would execute the `mkparents` Makefile in the given build directory to create necessary parent directories.'
        mouse: '[AI] The term "micro-mouse" does not directly refer to a flag, but rather a type of small computer mouse with a minimal design. It was popularized by Microsoft in the late 1980s and early 1990s as an affordable alternative to larger mice. However, if you mean a specific "micro-mouse" flag, it would depend on the context as there might be no such thing standardized in computing or programming.'
        options: '[AI] The `micro` text editor supports various options that can be passed to it using the `-` flag followed by an option letter or a key-value pair. For instance, `micro -e my_command` runs `my_command` after starting the editor, or `micro -s my_shortcut:my_action` defines a custom shortcut. These options allow customizing various aspects of the editor''s behavior for enhanced productivity and efficiency.'
        parsecursor: |-
            [AI] The `micro` text editor's `--parse-cursor` flag is an option used during command-line invocation. It modifies the behavior of the cursor when editing files with specific syntax highlighting or markup languages, such as Markdown or HTML.

            Instead of treating these files as plain text, `micro` attempts to parse the file's syntax, thereby enabling syntax highlighting and providing enhanced editing features. The cursor position is maintained within this parsed representation, which can be advantageous for locating specific elements in the document.
        paste: '[AI] The `micro -p` flag is a command-line option for the text editor Micro. It enables paste mode, which allows users to paste text without it being interpreted as commands or other special characters. This is useful when working with code or other text that contains sensitive or formatted data, ensuring that the pasted text retains its original formatting and structure in the editor.'
        permbackup: '[AI] The `micro` command with the option `--permbackup` creates a backup of files or directories before performing any destructive operations, such as deletion or modification of file permissions. This is achieved by appending a tilde (~) character to the names of the backed-up items. For example, if you run `micro --permbackup somefile`, and later delete that file using `micro somefile`, the original file will be renamed to `somefile~`. This option can help prevent accidental loss of data or changes to file permissions.'
        plugin: '[AI] The term "micro-plugin" refers to a lightweight, modular software component designed for extending or enhancing the functionality of an application or system, particularly in the context of microservices architecture. Micro-plugins are built using small footprint technologies, ensuring they consume minimal resources, and they typically have well-defined interfaces that enable easy integration with other components. This approach promotes flexibility, scalability, and fast development cycles as each plugin addresses a specific functionality without affecting the entire application or system.'
        pluginchannels: '[AI] The `micros` flag in a Flagset, specifically for Matrix, is used to configure plugin channels. Plugin channels are specialized rooms where third-party apps or bots can be invited and interact with the community. By setting the `micros` flag to `true`, you allow these plugins to join uninvited and participate in the room''s events. This can lead to more automation, integrations, and custom functionalities for your Matrix server.'
        pluginrepos: '[AI] The `micro --pluginrepos` flag is a command-line option for the Micro framework in Rust. It is used to specify one or more plugin repositories, which are remote URLs where Micro can download and manage plugins as dependencies. For example, `micro new_project --pluginrepos https://example.com/plugins` will initialize a new Micro project with plugins from the given repository. This flag helps extend the functionality of Micro applications by easily integrating external plugins.'
        readonly: '[AI] The `microrreadonly` flag is a Git configuration setting that prevents accidental commits or file modifications in a Git repository. When this flag is set for a repository or a specific branch, it makes the repository read-only, meaning that no new commits can be pushed or pulled, and files cannot be modified or deleted. This is useful when you want to prevent unwanted changes, such as in production environments or shared repositories. It''s important to note that this flag does not affect local modifications, so users can still make changes on their local clone of the repository before pushing them back to the remote server.'
        relativeruler: '[AI] The term "micro-relative-ruler" is not a standard or widely recognized concept in flags or rulers. It seems to be a made-up name without a defined meaning. A flag is a piece of fabric with symbols, colors, or designs used as a symbol, signal, or identification for a country, organization, or idea. A ruler is a straightedge instrument used for measuring distances or checking the accuracy of other measurements. If you meant to ask about a specific micro flag or relative ruler concept, please provide more context or clarify your question.'
        rmtrailingws: '[AI] The `micro` command with the option `-rm trailing-ws` is used to remove trailing whitespaces in a file. In other words, it removes any extra spaces at the end of each line within the file. This option ensures that text files maintain consistent formatting and makes them easier to read and work with, especially when dealing with programming or configuration files.'
        ruler: '[AI] The term "micro-ruler" is not a widely recognized flag or symbol in heraldry or vexillology. It''s likely a made-up name without any specific meaning or design associated with it. In heraldry, a ruler is typically depicted as a scepter topped by a ball or a rod with a horizontal and vertical band, representing power and rule. The micro prefix in this context may suggest small scale or intricacy, but without additional information, it''s impossible to determine the precise meaning or appearance of a "micro-ruler" flag.'
        savecursor: '[AI] The `micro-savecursor` is a command or flag used in text editors, specifically in the micro editor. This command allows users to save and restore the cursor position in a file. When you use this command, it saves the current cursor position (row and column) to a mark. You can then go to another location in the file using standard editing commands, but when you use the `''m''` command, it will return the cursor to its saved position. This feature is useful for quickly navigating large files or repeating complex editing tasks without losing your place.'
        savehistory: '[AI] The `micromh` flag `-savehistory` is used in Bash scripting to enable the saving of command history in a file upon shell termination. When set, this option ensures that all executed commands are written to the specified file before the shell exits. This feature can be useful for preserving and reviewing past commands, making it easier to reuse them or to analyze shell usage patterns. The file path needs to be provided as an argument when invoking the `bash` command with this option. For example: `bash -c "commands_here" -savehistory /path/to/save/history.txt`.'
        saveundo: |-
            [AI] The `micro-saveundo` flag is not a standard or widely recognized flag. It appears to be specific to the text editor called "Micro," which is a minimalistic and highly configurable terminal-based editor.

            This flag is used to enable or disable the auto-save and undo features in Micro. When set to `saveundo on`, it will automatically save your file every few seconds, and allow you to undo and redo editing actions. Setting it to `saveundo off` disables these features.
        scrollbar: '[AI] The `--mile-scrollbar` is a CSS property in Chrome DevTools and some other web browsers that allows disabling the default large scrollbars and enabling micro or thin ones instead. This can be useful for improving the look of websites with minimal design where large scrollbars might be distracting. It''s a developer tool feature, not something you would typically use in production code. The property takes a boolean value: `--webkit-scrollbar: none;` to disable large scrollbars and show micro ones instead.'
        scrollmargin: '[AI] The `scroll-margin` property in CSS is a shorthand for setting the `scroll-margin-top`, `scroll-margin-right`, `scroll-margin-bottom`, and `scroll-margin-left` properties on an element. It specifies the amount of margin that should be added around the content when it''s being scrollably contained by its parent, such as a `div` with `overflow-y: scroll`. The value is usually given in length units, but can also include percentage or keywords like `auto`. This property helps control the spacing between an element and the scrollbar that appears when the content overflows. In micro-interactions design, it''s used to create a consistent look and feel between different parts of an application. For example, you could set all list items in a long scrolling list to have the same `scroll-margin` value, ensuring that they remain visually aligned with the scrollbar as the user interacts with the content.'
        scrollspeed: '[AI] The `micro-scrollspeed` is a flag used in Chrome DevTools for adjusting the granularity of scrolling speed. It accepts a value between 0 and 1, with smaller values representing slower scroll speeds and larger values representing faster ones. This flag can be useful for debugging or accessibility purposes when fine-grained control over the scrolling speed is required. By default, this flag is set to 1, meaning the scrolling speed is at its fastest.'
        smartpaste: '[AI] The `micro-smartpaste` is a flag used in text editors and command-lines, particularly in Vim and Neovim editors. It enables the automatic conversion of pasted data into the desired format based on its content. For instance, if text is pasted, it will be treated as plain text; if a table or list is pasted, it will be treated accordingly. This flag enhances productivity by reducing manual formatting efforts while pasting data.'
        softwrap: '[AI] The term "micro-softwrap" is not a recognized flag or command in computing, and it does not correspond to any known software or tool from Microsoft or otherwise. It appears to be a misinterpretation or typo of two separate terms: "Microsoft" and "Software Protection." Microsoft is a multinational technology company that produces computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services. Software protection refers to measures taken to prevent unauthorized use, copying, or distribution of software. There is no flag associated with this combination of terms.'
        splitbottom: '[AI] The term "micro-splitbottom" is not directly related to a specific flag, but rather a designation for a particular type of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. It refers to a ductless mini-split system with a micro-channel condenser, which has smaller and more densely packed coils than conventional mini-splits, resulting in higher energy efficiency and greater cooling capacity. The "split" part of the name signifies that these systems consist of two main components: an indoor evaporator unit and an outdoor condensing unit, connected by refrigerant lines but otherwise operating independently. These systems allow for individual temperature control in each zone they serve and require minimal ductwork, making them a popular choice for retrofitting older buildings or adding climate control to additions or garages.'
        splitright: '[AI] The term "micro-split right" does not directly refer to a flag but rather a type of HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system. In this system, one outdoor unit is connected to two or more indoor units through refrigerant lines and electrical cables. The "right" in micro-split right refers to the direction of airflow, meaning that each indoor unit blows air into the room it is installed in, providing individual temperature control for different spaces within a building.'
        statusformatl: '[AI] The `-flag micro -statusformatl` is a command line argument used in tools like `docker` and `kubernetes`. It sets the output format for status commands to a machine-readable, compact style. Each container or pod status is displayed as a single line with essential details such as image name, status (running, waiting, error, etc.), and container ID or pod name. This flag helps automate scripts and tools that need to process large numbers of containers or pods quickly.'
        statusformatr: '[AI] The `-flag micro -statusformat` is a command line option used with tools like Docker and Kubernetes for modifying the format of output from their respective `status` subcommands. This flag sets the output format to be very brief or "micro," providing only essential information in a compact manner. Specifically, it may display just the running container names, their images, and status (e.g., running or exited) with no additional details.'
        statusline: '[AI] The `micro-statusline` is a configuration option in the text editor Micro. It determines the format and display of the status bar at the bottom of the editor window. The status line can show various information such as the current file name, cursor position, percentage completion of long actions, and other customizable items. By default, `micro-statusline` displays the file path and percentage completion progress when performing an action like saving or searching. Users can modify this setting to customize the displayed information by adjusting its configuration in Micro''s RC file.'
        sucmd: '[AI] The `micro` flag in SSH configuration refers to the use of the MicroSsh client as the subsystem for running remote commands over SSH. The `-s` option sets the SSH subsystem to use, and `-m` or `--` is used to specify the path to the MicroSsh binary. So, `micro -s cmd` in an SSH config line means that MicroSsh will be used as the subsystem for running remote commands.'
        syntax: '[AI] The term "micro-syntax" refers to the smallest units of grammar and syntax rules in a programming language or a formal language. It focuses on the structure and arrangement of individual tokens, symbols, and characters within a language, as well as their immediate relationships with each other. Micro-syntax rules describe the precise sequence, grouping, and ordering of these elements to form valid expressions or statements within the language. Understanding micro-syntax is essential for parsing and correctly interpreting code in a compiler or interpreter.'
        tabmovement: '[AI] The `-micro` flag in Vim or Vi is used to enable micro-motion for character and text movements. In contrast to default macro-motion, which moves a whole word or line at a time, micro-motion allows you to move a cursor precisely by specified characters, columns or lines. This can be useful when performing fine editing tasks or moving through code with high accuracy. For example, instead of pressing `w` to move to the next word, you can use `b` for back, `3c` for three characters forward, or `20J` for twenty lines down.'
        tabsize: '[AI] The `-tabsize` option in Micro, a terminal-based text editor, sets the number of spaces that represent a tab character in the editor. By default, Micro uses a tab size of eight spaces. However, you can use the `-tabsize` flag followed by the desired number of spaces per tab when invoking Micro from the command line to change this behavior. For instance, `micro -tabsize=4 file.txt` sets the tab size to four spaces in the editor for the given file.'
        tabstospaces: '[AI] The `micro --tabstospaces` flag is a command-line option for the text editor called Micro. It sets Micro to expand tabs to spaces when typing and editing files. The number of spaces is usually configurable through other settings or defaults to eight spaces per tab. This can make the text look more uniform when working with code or text files, as each indentation level will be consistently represented by the same number of spaces.'
        useprimary: '[AI] The `micro --use-primary` flag is a command-line option used in the Micro Python interpreter, which is a minimal implementation of the Python programming language. This flag indicates that MicroPython should use the primary thread as the main interpreter thread and execute all the code therein, instead of creating additional threads or processes for parallel execution. This can be beneficial in microcontroller environments with limited resources where multi-threading support may not be available or efficient. By setting this flag, users can ensure that MicroPython utilizes a single thread for executing their Python code.'
        version: '[AI] The `--version` flag is a common command-line option used in various applications, including microservices frameworks and programming languages. This flag is used to display version information about the specific software or tool being used. When run with the `micro` command, it will print out the version number of the Microservice CLI tool itself.'
        wordwrap: '[AI] The `micro` text editor''s `--wordwrap` option is used to enable or disable word wrapping in the terminal output. When this flag is set, long lines of text will be wrapped automatically so that they fit within the width of the terminal window. This makes reading longer lines easier on the eye and prevents text from being truncated at the right edge of the terminal. It does not affect the file editing functionality of `micro`, only the display of text in the terminal.'
        xterm: '[AI] The `micro` flag is not related to a specific flag for an X terminal window, but rather refers to the text editor named Micro. When using this editor, the flag `-xterm` specifies that it should run in an X terminal window emulating the xterm terminal type, allowing features such as scrollback history and mouse support.'
