documentation:
    command: '[AI] `systemctl` is a system and service manager for init systems in Linux. The `set-environment` subcommand is used to set or modify system-wide environment variables persistently across all system services and processes. These variables are stored in the `/etc/sysconfig/environment-d` directory as individual files, with each file representing a single variable. To use it, simply call `systemctl set-environment <variable> <value>`, replacing `<variable>` and `<value>` with the desired variable name and value respectively. Changes made with this command take effect after rebooting or restarting the systemd service manager with `systemctl daemon-reload`.'
