documentation:
    command: '[AI] `wineboot` is a command used in WINE, an open-source compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Unix or Linux systems. The `wineboot` command is used to perform a clean reboot or shutdown of the Windows services and applications managed by WINE. It restarts the WINE daemon (wineserver) along with all Windows services, ensuring that any changes made to the system take effect after a reboot.'
    flag:
        end-session: '[AI] `wineboot` is a command-line utility for Wine, a compatibility layer that allows running Windows applications on Linux and other POSIX-compliant systems. The `--end-session` option is used to end the current Wine session gracefully. It stops all running Windows applications, releases any resources they were using, and saves their states if configured to do so. After ending a session, you can start a new one using the `wineboot` command with no arguments or by rebooting the system if you prefer to start fresh. This is useful when experiencing application crashes, freezes, or other issues in Wine that might be resolved by restarting the session.'
        force: '[AI] `wineboot` is a command-line utility for WINE, an open-source compatibility layer that allows running Windows applications on Linux and other POSIX-compliant operating systems. The `--force` option is used to perform a hard reboot of the WINE environment. It shuts down all running Windows applications, restarts the WINE services, and applies any pending configuration changes. This can be helpful when dealing with application crashes or system instability in the WINE environment.'
        help: |-
            [AI] `wineboot` is a command-line utility for WINE, an compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux. Its main purpose is managing WINE's state, including starting and stopping the Wine service.

            The `--help` flag provides a brief summary of the available options and usage:

            ```bash
            Usage: wineboot [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]...

            Manage WINE's state.

            Options:
              --quiet, -q              Run without interactive messages
              --version                 Print version information and exit
              --help                    Show this help message and exit

            Commands:
              start               Start the wine-preload service and reboot into Wine
              stop                Stop the wine-preload service and reboot back to the system default
              status              Display the current state of Wine (running or not)
            ```

            In summary, using `wineboot --help` will display a list of available options and their usage for managing the WINE environment with the WINE bootloader.
        init: '[AI] `wineboot` is a utility for managing Wine, a compatibility layer that allows running Windows applications on Linux. The command `wineboot --init` is used to perform an automated boot process in Wine. It restarts the Wine services and resets the state of Wine applications, allowing them to start with fresh configurations. This can be helpful when troubleshooting application compatibility issues or when an application has become unresponsive.'
        kill: '[AI] `wineboot` is a utility used in Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux. The command `wineboot --kill` forces Wine to terminate all processes and services related to the current Wine prefix, effectively restarting the environment from scratch. This can be useful when dealing with persistent issues or configuration changes that require a complete reset of the Wine setup.'
        restart: '[AI] `wineboot` is a command-line utility for Wine, a compatibility layer that allows running Windows applications on Linux. The `--restart` option instructs `wineboot` to restart the Wine prefix or wine service and all its associated Windows applications. This can be useful when making changes to the Wine configuration or installed software, as it ensures that any new settings are applied and that all affected applications are closed and restarted properly.'
        shutdown: '[AI] `wineboot` is a command-line utility for Wine, a compatibility layer that allows running Windows applications on Linux and other POSIX-compliant systems. The `--shutdown` option is used to perform an orderly shutdown of the Wine session. It stops all running processes in the Wine prefix (a directory containing the configuration and installed software for a specific Wine setup), releases any held resources, and saves the state of those processes before terminating them. This allows for cleanly closing a Wine session, ensuring that any running applications save their data properly and leaving the system in a stable state.'
        update: '[AI] `wineboot` is a command-line utility for Wine, a compatibility layer that allows running Windows applications on Linux. The `--update` option triggers an update of Wine''s components and configurations. It fetches the latest Wine version from the repositories (if available) or applies any local updates, then restarts the Wine prefixes to apply the changes. This command is typically used when you want to ensure your Wine environment is up-to-date before running a specific Windows application.'
