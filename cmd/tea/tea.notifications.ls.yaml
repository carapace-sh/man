documentation:
    command: '[AI] The command "tea notifications ls" is not a standard Linux command, as it appears to be specific to the `tea` notification manager in certain applications or environments. This command is likely used to list current notifications managed by the `tea` notification system. The exact output and behavior may depend on the specific implementation of the `tea` tool.'
    flag:
        fields: '[AI] The command `tea notifications ls --fields` is used in the Tea interface, a CLI tool for managing Kubernetes notifications. This specific command lists all notifications with the given fields displayed. The flags `--notifications` specifies that we are working with notifications and `--fields` indicates that only the specified fields should be shown in the output.'
        limit: '[AI] The command `tea notifications ls --limit` is a notification listing command in the Tea UI (User Interface) of the Kubernetes event handling tool, `teaproject/teasql`. The `--limit` flag is used to specify the maximum number of events or notifications to display. By default, it shows up to 20 notifications, but with this flag, you can limit the output to any desired number. This helps in managing and filtering a large volume of notifications effectively.'
        login: '[AI] The command `tea notifications ls --login` is related to Tea, an open-source and unopinionated notification center for Wayland compositors. The `ls` part of the command is a Linux utility that lists files or directories in a certain way. In this context, it''s likely being used with the `--login` flag to list notifications for the currently logged in user session only. The entire command could be read as "List notifications for the current login session using Tea."'
        mine: '[AI] `tea notifications ls --mine` is a command using the Tea UI (User Interface) for interacting with the Kubernetes event notifications. The command lists events labeled with the key `--mine` which indicates they belong to the current user or namespace.'
        output: |-
            [AI] The command `tee notifications ls --output` is a combination of several Unix utilities used for I/O redirection and listing file contents.

            1. `ls`: This is a command used to list files and directories in a Linux or Unix system. By default, it lists the files and directories in the current directory.
            2. `--output`: This option with `ls` is used to redirect the output of the `ls` command to another file or stream. It can be followed by `> filename` for writing output to a file or `| command` for piping it to another command.
            3. `tee`: The `tee` command takes standard input and writes it to both the terminal screen and one or more files. This is useful when you want to see the output in real-time on the terminal while saving it to a file simultaneously. In this context, it's not explicitly mentioned in the given command but could be used with a pipe `|` symbol, for example: `ls --output | tee outputfile.txt`.
            4. The combination of these commands without the `tee` part would look like: `ls --output > outputfile.txt`, which will list the contents of the current directory into the file named "outputfile.txt" instead of displaying it on the terminal.
        page: '[AI] `tea notifications ls --page` is a command in the Tea (Traditional Unix-like Environment for Alpine) shell, specifically related to the Tea notification system. This command lists current notification alerts with pagination, displaying one page of results at a time. The notifications can be from various sources such as email, IRC, or system messages.'
        remote: |-
            [AI] The command `tee notifications ls --remote` is a combination of several Unix utilities used in a Linux or macOS terminal. Here's what each part does:

            1. `ls`: List the files and directories in a directory.
            2. `--remote`: This option with the 'ls' command allows it to display information from a remote directory over SSH.
            3. `tee`: A command-line utility that can read from standard input (stdin), write the same data to another file or to standard output (stdout), and also pass the data further down the pipeline to other commands. In this context, 'tee notifications' likely refers to writing the output of the following command to a file named 'notifications' and also displaying it on the terminal.
            4. `;`: The semicolon separates multiple commands in a single pipeline. When you run multiple commands in a pipeline with semicolons, the second (and subsequent) commands are executed only after the first one has finished. In this context, `tee notifications ls --remote` is a single command made up of three parts: `ls --remote`, `tee notifications`, and the terminal will execute them sequentially.
        repo: '[AI] The command `tea notifications ls --repo` is a feature of Teapot, a CLI tool for GitHub''s Octokit API. This specific command lists all the repository notifications set up for a given GitHub repository, displaying each notification''s event type (e.g., "push"), event actor (user or app), and description if available. The `--repo` flag specifies the target repository for the operation.'
        states: '[AI] The command `tea notifications ls --states` is a part of the TeaUI framework in Kubernetes. This command lists the current state of all notification channels defined in a Tea UI application. Notification channels represent different ways to receive notifications, such as email, Slack, or SMS. The `--states` flag displays the current status (enabled or disabled) for each channel.'
        types: |-
            [AI] The command `tea notifications ls --types` is related to Tea, a lightweight and modern desktop environment for Wayland Compositors. This specific command is used to list notification types that are currently available in the Tea desktop environment.

            The `ls` part of the command stands for "list," which means it will display a list of items. In this case, those items are the notification types. The `--types` flag filters the output to only show the names of these notification types.

            So in summary, `tea notifications ls --types` lists the available notification types within the Tea desktop environment.
