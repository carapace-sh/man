    command: '[AI] "Waypoint deployment" is a term used in the context of Kubernetes and infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Hashicorp''s Waypoint. It refers to the process of deploying applications or services, along with their associated configuration, secrets, and dependencies, to a Kubernetes cluster using Waypoint. This is typically done by defining infrastructure and application configurations in HCL files, which are then compiled and applied to the target environment using Waypoint''s `plan` and `apply` commands. This approach allows for versioning, reproducibility, and easy management of infrastructure and applications within a GitOps workflow.'
