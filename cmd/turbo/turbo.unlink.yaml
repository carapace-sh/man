    command: |-
        [AI] The `turbo unlink` command is used in the Contextual Toolkit (Ctxtool) for Git, a set of Git extensions for easier interaction with repositories. This command removes a link or a reference to a specific local or remote commit, branch, or tag from the current Git repository.

        When you use `turbo unlink`, followed by the type and name of the link (e.g., `branch my_branch` or `tag v1.0.x`), Git will remove the specified link without deleting the object it points to, effectively detaching the local reference from the committed history. This can be helpful when dealing with unwanted branches, abandoned tags, or other situations where you want to modify your local Git configuration without affecting the underlying commits.

        Please note that this operation only affects your local repository and does not impact remote repositories unless you push the changes afterward.
