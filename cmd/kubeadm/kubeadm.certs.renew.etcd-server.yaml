description: Renew the certificate for serving etcd
flags:
    --cert-dir=: The path where to save the certificates
    --config=: Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
    --kubeconfig=: The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster. If the flag is not set, a set of standard locations can be searched for an existing kubeconfig file.
documentation:
    command: '[AI] The `kubeadm certs renew etcd-server` command is used to renew the TLS certification for the ETCD server in a Kubernetes cluster managed by `kubeadm`. This action helps ensure that the certificates used by the ETCD server for secure communication with other components of the cluster, such as the Kubernetes API server and member nodes, remain up-to-date and valid. By running this command, you will generate new private key and certificate files, replacing the old ones in their respective locations, and restarting the affected services (e.g., etcd) to apply the changes.'
    flag:
        cert-dir: '[AI] The command `kubeadm certs renew etcd-server --cert-dir` is used to renew the TLS certification files for the etcd server in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. The `--cert-dir` flag specifies the directory where the certification files are located, and the `etcd-server` argument indicates that the certification files for the etcd server should be renewed. This command is typically run periodically to ensure that the encryption between the etcd server and other components in the cluster remains secure.'
        config: '[AI] `kubeadm certs renew etcd-server` is a command used to renew the SSL certificates for the Etcd server in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubeadm. The `--config` flag specifies the location of the Kubeadm configuration directory, where the necessary YAML files and certificates are stored. This command ensures that the certificates used by the Etcd server for secure communication with other components in the cluster remain up-to-date and valid.'

            [AI] `kubeadm certs renew etcd-server` is a command used to renew the TLS certificates for the Etcd server in a Kubernetes cluster managed by `kubeadm`. The `--kubeconfig` flag specifies the location of the kubeconfig file, which contains the configuration information required to communicate with the cluster.

            When you run this command, `kubeadm` will generate new certificates and keys for the Etcd server, replacing the existing ones. This helps maintain the security of your Kubernetes cluster by keeping the certificates up-to-date and preventing expired or nearly-expired certificates from being used.

            It is important to note that renewing certificates should be done in a controlled environment, as changing configuration files can potentially impact the availability and functionality of the cluster. Make sure you have backups and understand the implications before running this command.
