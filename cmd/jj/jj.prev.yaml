    command: '[AI] The command `jj prev` is used in Vim or other compatible text editors with the `jump-mode` plugin installed. It is a shortcut for moving the cursor one screen upward in the history buffer, which is a list of previously edited locations in the file. This can be useful for quickly navigating through your editing history.'

            [AI] The command `jj prev --edit` is a combination of commands used in the Vim text editor.

            * `jj`: This represents two keys pressed consecutively, specifically the 'J' key. It is often used as an abbreviation for moving down one and a half screen pages in Vim.
            * `prev`: It is a command to go to the previous document or buffer in Vim. When editing multiple files, this can be useful to switch between them quickly.
            * `--edit`: This option is used with some other commands to specify that you want to edit the selected file rather than just open it as a read-only view. In this context, it ensures that the previously opened buffer is edited instead of being replaced with a new one when using the 'prev' command.
        help: '[AI] The command `jj prev --help` is used in Jupyter Notebook''s Jupyter-Jupyter (jj) tool for navigating between cells. The `prev` argument tells jj to move the selection to the previous cell, while `--help` displays the help information for that command. In summary, `jj prev --help` shows you how to use the ''prev'' command to navigate backward through your Jupyter Notebook cells with the jj tool.'
