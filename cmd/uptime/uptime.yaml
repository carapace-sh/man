    command: '[AI] The `uptime` command in Unix and Linux systems displays the system uptime, which is the duration that the system has been running since it was last rebooted. It shows the time as a number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds, followed by the current system time. Sometimes, it also includes the number of users currently logged in and the system load average.'

        help: |-
            [AI] `uptime --help` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to display system uptime information. When run with the `--help` option, it provides a brief explanation of the command's functionality and available options. Here's a concise summary:

            The `uptime` command without any options displays the current system time followed by the system uptime as uptime, load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes, and the number of users currently logged in.

            With the `--help` option (`uptime --help`), you'll receive a brief description of the command along with the available options:

            - `--brief` or `-b`: Display only the system uptime and the current system load averages.
            - `--verbose` or `-v`: Display additional details, including the system date, timezone information, and other system statistics.

            These options can be combined to customize the output according to your preferences. For example, `uptime -bv` will display both a brief uptime and verbose load averages.
        pretty: '[AI] The `uptime --pretty` command in Unix-based systems displays the system''s uptime in a more human-readable format with additional details. It shows the number of up days and up hours, minutes, and seconds, followed by the current time and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes. This information is presented in a formatted output, making it easier to read and interpret.'
        since: '[AI] The `uptime --since` command is a utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems used to display system uptime information. The `--since` option filters the output to show only the systems that have been running for a minimum specified duration. For example, `uptime --since=3h` will display the uptime of all systems that have been running for more than 3 hours. It helps in monitoring and managing multiple servers or systems, particularly in system administration tasks.'
        version: '[AI] The `uptime --version` command is used to display the version information of the `uptime` utility, which is a Linux or Unix command for displaying system uptime and the current system load averages. When executed with the `--version` option, it will print out only the version information related to the installed `uptime` program.'
